    "content": "Meta-owned chat app WhatsApp changed its business API policy this week to ban general-purpose chatbots from its platform. The move will likely affect WhatsApp-based assistants of companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, Khosla Ventures-backed Luzia, and General Catalyst-backed Poke. The company has added a new section to address “AI providers” in its business API terms, focusing on general-purpose chatbots. The terms, which will go into effect on January 15, 2026, say that Meta won’t allow AI model providers to distribute their AI assistants on WhatsApp. Providers and developers of artificial intelligence or machine learning technologies, including but not limited to large language models, generative artificial intelligence platforms, general-purpose artificial intelligence assistants, or similar technologies as determined by Meta in its sole discretion (“AI Providers”), are strictly prohibited from accessing or using the WhatsApp Business Solution, whether directly or indirectly, for the purposes of providing, delivering, offering, selling, or otherwise making available such technologies when such technologies are the primary (rather than incidental or ancillary) functionality being made available for use, as determined by Meta in its sole discretion. Meta confirmed this move to TechCrunch and specified that this move doesn’t affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a travel company running a bot for customer service won’t be barred from the service. Meta’s rationale behind this move is that WhatsApp Business API is designed for businesses serving customers rather than acting as a platform for chatbot distribution. The company said that while it built the API for business-to-business use cases, in recent months, it saw an unanticipated use case of serving general-purpose chatbots. “The purpose of the WhatsApp Business API is to help businesses provide customer support and send relevant updates. Our focus is on supporting the tens of thousands of businesses who are building these experiences on WhatsApp,” a Meta spokesperson said in a comment to TechCrunch. Meta said that the new chatbot use cases placed a lot of burden on its system with increased message volume and required a different kind of support, which the company wasn’t ready for. The company is banning use cases that fall outside “the intended design and strategic focus” of the API. The move will effectively make WhatsApp unavailable as a platform to distribute AI solutions like assistants or agents. It also means Meta AI is the only assistant available on the chat app. Last year, OpenAI launched ChatGPT on WhatsApp, and earlier this year, Perplexity launched its own bot on the chat app to tap into the user base of more than 3 billion people. Both of the bots could answer queries, understand media files, answer questions about them, reply to voice notes, and generate images. This likely generated a lot of message volume. However, there was a bigger issue for Meta. WhatsApp’s Business API is one of the primary ways the chat app makes money. It charges businesses based on different message templates like marketing, utility, authentication, and support. As there wasn’t any provision for chatbots in this API design, WhatsApp wasn’t able to charge them. During Meta’s Q1 2025 earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg pointed out that business messaging is a big opportunity for the company to bring in revenue. “Right now, the vast majority of our business is advertising in feeds on Facebook and Instagram,” he said. “But WhatsApp now has more than 3 billion monthly [active users], with more than 100 million people in the US and growing quickly there. Messenger is also used by more than a billion people each month, and there are now as many messages sent each day on Instagram as there are on Messenger. Business messaging should be the next pillar of our business.” Ivan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "content": "Over the past few weeks, the Department of Energy has been looking at canceling billions of dollars’ worth of contracts. Now the federal agency has confirmed that it’s axing $720 million worth of manufacturing awards. The cuts affect companies that make battery materials, recycle lithium-ion batteries, and manufacture super-insulating windows. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has been combing through contracts made during the Biden administration. The DOE claimed that the projects “missed milestones” and “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs,” spokesperson Ben Dietderich told E&E News. All of the money for the grants was authorized by Congress as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that was passed in 2021. The bulk of the money was awarded in 2023 and 2024; previously, the Trump administration had used grants awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day as justification for canceling awards. Three startups are on the list, and all three were selected for grants well before the 2024 presidential election. Ascend Elements has been refining a recycling technology that could turn manufacturing waste and end-of-life batteries into materials required to make lithium-ion batteries domestically. In October 2022, the company was awarded $316 million toward a $1 billion facility in Kentucky. Already, $206 million has been disbursed to Ascend Elements, according to federal government records. The company said it was moving ahead with its plans using other sources of funding to make up for any shortfall. Anovion was awarded $117 million to reshore a technology to produce synthetic graphite for lithium-ion batteries anodes. Chinese suppliers control 75% of the supply chain for synthetic graphite and produce 97% of all synthetic graphite anodes, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. The startup’s plant is slated to be built in Alabama and, to date, only $13.8 million has been disbursed, according to a federal database. Another startup, LuxWall, makes windows that insulate buildings as well as solid walls, a breakthrough that could slash energy use and reduce people’s utility bills. The DOE had awarded the company $31.7 million to build a factory on the site of an old coal plant near Detroit. The award was granted in November 2023, though only $1 million has been sent to the company, according to government records. LuxWall opened the first phase of its factory in August 2024. TechCrunch had previously reported on the Department of Energy’s efforts to cancel these and other contracts. The grants had been intended, in part, to launch the startups over the “valley of death” that can claim many promising companies as they transition from technology development to commercial deployment. First-of-a-kind factories and facilities aren’t easy for startups to finance, and government grants like these encouraged private investors to contribute capital. Once up and running, they can serve as a template for future factories, bolstering the country’s manufacturing base. Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "content": "The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox. Howdy readers! Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present, and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B. Believe it or not, it’s been a year since we launched our Q&A series featuring founders of transportation startups. And as promised, we are checking in with these founders as their one-year interview anniversary date comes up. First up on our check-in list is Frank Reig with Revel. TC Sessions: Mobility 2022 is just a few days away and I do hope some of my Station readers are there to hear from founders of Aurora, Luminar, Nuro, Veo, and Zoox; early-stage investors from Elemental, Muirwoods Ventures, and PearVC; strategic and institutional investors from Capital International Investors, GM Ventures, Intel Capital, and Snowbull Capital; and top engineers, designers, and executives from Arrival, Cruise, Motional, Nvidia, Stellantis, VW Group, and Waymo. Oh, and of course, watch the pitch-off, network with other builders and investors, and maybe even mix it up with some TechCrunch reporters and editors. A bunch of us will be there. If you can’t attend and still want the inside scoop, buy the online pass. For $45, you get analyst commentary alongside all recorded videos from the entire event starting May 20 for one week. You also get access to the online sponsor expo network with other attendees online. “Mobility month,” which I officially declared last week, continued with a TechCrunch Live event with Waabi founder and CEO Raquel Urtasun and Khosla Ventures partner Sven Strohband, who joined us to talk about raising monster rounds. Click the link to watch the session. The next mobility-themed TechCrunch Live event will be held on May 25 at noon PDT. The session, focused on mobility marketplaces, will feature Mike Ghaffary, general partner at Canvas Ventures, and Walker Drewett, founder of on-demand vehicle brake repair services startup NuBrakes. Register here and tune in to hear how Drewett raised capital and built NuBrakes on the lessons from his previous startup, NuWash (it’s on-demand car washes, of course). Don’t forget, we pick three startup founders attending the live event to give their pitch and get feedback from our two guests. As always, you can email me at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com to share thoughts, criticisms, opinions, or tips. You also can send a direct message to @kirstenkorosec. It was a decent week for micromobility news, so let’s jump right in: Amazon is hiring a micromobility fleet manager to help decarbonize last-mile deliveries. Also, meet the skier delivering for Amazon in a remote Austrian village. Bird and Lime are using Google’s ARCore Geospatial API to power their smartphone camera-based scooter/bike parking solution. Gogoro is launching its Smartscooters and battery-swapping technology in Tel Aviv this summer, with plans to expand into other Israeli cities. Specialized has launched a sub-brand called Globe dedicated to building affordable, high-quality electric utility bikes that are designed to replace car trips. Unagi is launching “Unagi On-Demand,” the scooter manufacturer’s own, more exclusive, version of shared micromobility. Voi is expanding in Birmingham to more than 80 square kilometers of the city, doubling the size of its operations and allowing riders to travel across the city. A couple of weeks ago, we talked about the U.K.’s potential plans to legalize private e-scooters. Well, the Queen of England made her speech this week, announcing the legalization of private e-scooters has been passed, but with some strict guidance on speed limits and possibly helmet wearing and indicators. China is in lockdown, but bike traffic is surging. In Shanghai, where lockdowns have eased slightly, bikes are the only available transportation for those who are allowed to leave their homes. Denver introduced a $400 rebate for e-bikes, plus additional $500 for an e-cargo bike, two weeks ago. Since then, 2,600 residents have applied. Remember how cute some NYC blocks looked during the pandemic when restaurants expanded into the street? A campaign called NYC 25×25 is trying to keep streets open to pedestrians and cyclists, rather than letting things go back to car-centric normality. The campaign is demanding for 25% of street space to be converted from car use to walkable pedestrian plazas, green space, bus lanes, and dedicated cycle paths by 2025. Seattle is renewing its shared micromobility permits and there are a few changes. Lime, LINK by Superpedestrian, and Bird, which is a newcomer to the market, have been awarded scooter permits. Lime and Veo also have permits for shared e-bikes. Wheels and Spin will not continue operating in Seattle and have few weeks to wind down their operations. Just when I thought we had finally seen the end of mobility SPACs, Getaround signed up for the gig. The online peer-to-peer car-sharing rental startup has agreed to merge with special purpose acquisition company InterPrivate II Acquisition Corp. in a deal that will value the combined entity at $1.2 billion. The blank-check company said it will provide Getaround with at least $225 million and up to $434 million in gross proceeds, including a convertible note commitment of up to $175 million provided by affiliates of Mudrick Capital Management. Both parties said the “net transaction proceeds will provide adequate funding to achieve adjusted EBITDA breakeven under its current business plan.” TechCrunch has been following Getaround since 2010, when it was barely a year old. The following spring, Getaround won TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield at Disrupt NYC. The company has raised close to $600 million and has a long list of backers that includes SoftBank Vision Fund, Toyota, PeopleFund, Reid Hoffman and Mark Pincus’ Reinvent Capital, AmRest founder Henry McGovern, Pennant Investors, VectoIQ partners Steve Girsky, Mary Chan and Julia Steyn, and Menlo Ventures — just to name a few. Other deals that got my attention this week … 6K, a company developing engineered materials for lithium-ion batteries and additive manufacturing, raised $102 million in its Series D round led by Koch Strategic Platforms, a subsidiary of Koch Investments Group. Other new investors included Energy Impact Partners, Albemarle, and HG Ventures. Bliq, the startup that developed a workflow management software for gig economy drivers, raised $13.5 million in a Series A round led by NEA, with participation from Speedinvest and existing investors Proeza Ventures, Revel Venture Partners, and Andreas Kupke. Cabify secured a €40 million loan from the European Investment Bank to purchase 1,400 electric vehicles and associated EV charging infrastructure, which will help the ride-hail company achieve its target of a zero-emissions fleet in Spain by 2025. Carma, the Australian online used car platform, raised $52 million in a Series A round led by General Catalyst Partners and Tiger Global. GetHenry is one of the latest startups to crop up in answer to the growing demand for last-mile delivery. The company raised $17.4 million in seed funding to expand its business of providing utility e-bikes to couriers and fleet customers across Europe. Instacart filed confidentially to go public this week. TC+ editor Alex Wilhelm weighed in on the long-awaited IPO and pointed to three important questions on the future of the company. Reby, a European micromobility startup, was acquired by Canadian private equity firm House of Lithium for about $100 million. This will give Reby the financial capacity and capital markets expertise needed to continue its growth, the companies say. Swiggy, the seven-year-old Indian fast delivery service startup, reached an agreement to acquire Dineout, a popular dining out and restaurant tech platform, for $200 million, sources told TechCrunch. Welp, it’s been a topsy turvy helluva of a week for mobility SPACs, especially the EV ones. Take it as a giant red flashing signal that this will be a tough and volatile year for them. A few of these companies reported earnings this past week — and it was mostly what you would expect from pre-revenue operations. The downside pressure of widening losses and depleting cash is a bigger issue for some companies than others. Like Canoo, for instance. Canoo’s first-quarter earnings showed a company burning through cash, no near-term revenue, and a warning that it may not have enough money to stay in business. Yup, it issued a “going concern” warning. Fisker was one SPAC that had some critical and good news to share. Fisker and Foxconn sealed a deal to build the EV maker’s second all-electric model, the PEAR Urban Lifestyle EV, in Ohio. This was expected, but it did hinge on Foxconn purchasing a factory in Ohio from Lordstown Motors, another struggling SPAC. Lordstown Motors completed this week the $230 million deal to sell Foxconn the former GM Assembly Plant, a sale that is nothing short of a lifeline for the SPAC. Lordstown said in a securities filing earlier in the week — and before the deal had closed — that its ability to continue as a company and achieve production targets for the Endurance depended upon the deal with Foxconn. Had Lordstown failed to close the deal with Foxconn, it would have had to pay back the $200 million it has received in down payments from the company since November, including $50 million in the quarter just ended. Despite the challenges, the company said in its earnings report that it hopes by July to build a limited number of pre-production vehicles for testing, certification, validation, and regulatory approvals, and to demonstrate the capabilities of the Endurance pickup truck to potential customers. Embark, which is developing autonomous vehicle technology for trucking, also had a problematic week, at least in terms of its share price. The SPAC didn’t report earnings this week, and yet its share price fell off a cliff, dropping 62% from the opening bell on May 9 to the market close on May 10. It has since rebounded. The share price fall was curious, especially since the company reported on that same day that it had successfully completed on-road testing in snowy conditions in Montana. Have investors lost their patience with demos and testing? Or is something else afoot? Aurora is embarking on an autonomous trucking pilot with Covenant Logistics, a U.S. freight carrier. Some police departments are using the recordings taken by autonomous vehicles like Cruise and Waymo for intel on investigative leads. Kodiak Robotics publicly demonstrated its so-called “fallback” system, which means its self-driving truck can pull itself over to the side of the road in the event of a failure. “To launch an autonomous vehicle without a human driver, you must ensure the vehicle will protect motorists in the case of a truck or autonomous system failure,” Kodiak founder and CEO Don Burnette said in a statement, adding the feature is a fundamental necessity to achieving that level of safety. Moovit, the Israel-based trip planning app owned by Intel through its Mobileye subsidiary, is integrating with Orlando-based autonomous shuttle startup Beep. The integration will allow riders to view options for taking Beep shuttles alongside other forms of transit, like buses or trains. Batteries have become VC and PE’s most electric investment opportunity, writes TC+ reporter Tim De Chant. Elon Musk gave a wide-ranging interview at FT’s Future of the Car event in London. We provide a roundup of some of his most interesting comments on the transportation front, including that Tesla could stop taking orders for its cars until it works through the current backlog. Ford gave a bevy of reporters access to its new all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck. TechCrunch couldn’t attend, but luckily many others were. Harley-Davidson unveiled a second electric motorcycle called the Del Mar. The launch edition of the Del Mar has already sold out. McLaren Racing confirmed it will compete in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship next season, which is the start of the Gen3 era of the all-electric racing series. The McLaren Formula E Team will be formed through the acquisition of the Mercedes-EQ Formula E Team. Ian James, team principal of the Mercedes-EQ Formula E Team, will continue to lead the team. Rivian’s first-quarter losses widened nearly fourfold as the EV maker burned through cash, battling supply chain constraints and production bottlenecks to bring its electric vehicles to market. Despite missing analysts’ expectations, shares popped, likely in response to the company sticking to its production guidance for the year and CEO RJ Scaringe’s insistence that the company has the cash needed to execute its future plans. Tesla is punting on plans to build EVs in India, Reuters reported. VW Group’s supervisory board approved plans to launch a new EV brand in the U.S. called Scout, which will produce a rugged SUV and a pickup truck. TechCrunch had the scoop, including some leaked renderings, which have since been released by the company. There are a lot of important details in the story, including that these EVs will not be built on VW’s underlying MEB platform. Also, there will be another VW factory coming to the states; we just don’t know where yet. My bet? Well, it won’t be at its existing Chattanooga factory. Google gives Android Auto a major update, including a refreshed UI. Mercedes-Benz will start offering its Level 3 automated driving system, approved for public roads in Germany, beginning May 17. The Drive Pilot system will be offered as an option on S-Class and EQS models and will cost 5,000 euros ($5,300) on the S-Class and 7,430 euros on the EQS in Germany. Seeing Machines will be delivering its Driver Monitoring System to a “leading Japanese carmaker.” Three guesses who! Uber shareholders voted against a proposal that would have required the ride-hailing company to fully disclose its direct and indirect lobbying activities and expenditures. While the measure has been proposed and rejected by shareholders before, this year’s results show a growing number of shareholders are keen to require full disclosure. About 45% of shareholders voted in favor of the measure as opposed to around 30% last year. Two-thirds of shareholders need to vote in favor for a proposal to be approved.

    "content": "“Hoisted by their own GPTards.” That’s how Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun described the blowback after OpenAI researchers did a victory lap over GPT-5’s supposed math breakthroughs. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis added, “This is embarrassing.” The Decoder reports that in a since-deleted tweet, OpenAI VP Kevin Weil declared that “GPT-5 found solutions to 10 (!) previously unsolved Erdős problems and made progress on 11 others.” (“Erdős problems” are famous conjectures posed by mathematician Paul Erdős.) However, mathematician Thomas Bloom, who maintains the Erdos Problems website, said Weil’s post was “a dramatic misrepresentation” — while these problems were indeed listed as “open” on Bloom’s website, he said that only means “I personally am unaware of a paper which solves it.” In other words, it’s not accurate to claim GPT-5 was able to solve previously unsolved problems. Instead, Bloom wrote, “GPT-5 found references, which solved these problems, that I personally was unaware of.” Sebastien Bubeck, an OpenAI researcher who’d also been touting GPT-5’s accomplishments, then acknowledged that “only solutions in the literature were found,” but he suggested this remains a real accomplishment: “I know how hard it is to search the literature.” Bring a +1 and save 60%Have a +1 you’d like to bring to Disrupt?

Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B. Welcome to May, which we have informally dubbed “Mobility Month” here at TechCrunch. We’ll kick off Mobility Month with a TechCrunch Live event focused on building a better mobility fintech startup featuring Rachel Holt of Construct Capital and Caribou CEO Kevin Bennett. TC Live, which is free, will be livestreamed beginning at 11:30 a.m. PT May 4. The session starts with networking and pitch practice submissions and then moves on to an interview with Holt and Bennett at noon, followed by the TCL Pitch Practice at 12:30 pm PT. Register here for free. TechCrunch Live records weekly on Wednesday at 11:30 am PT / 2:30 pm ET. Click here to register for free and gain access to Caribou’s pitch deck, enter the pitch practice session and access the livestream where you can ask the speakers questions. Reminder that the agenda is out for TC Sessions: Mobility 2022. I think we put together a pretty sweet program. A few new announcements you might have missed includes an interview we’ll have with Sterling Anderson, co-founder and CPO of Aurora, and Rebecca Yeung, corporate VP of operations science and advanced technology at FedEx. We’ll be announcing a couple more guests in the next few days. As always, you can email me at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com to share thoughts, criticisms, opinions or tips. You also can send a direct message to me at Twitter — @kirstenkorosec. For some bizarre reason, it’s illegal for people to use privately owned e-scooters on public roads in England. Instead, e-scooters can only be legally ridden as part of government-backed rental pilots. However, England is finally getting around to legalizing private e-scooters for use on roads. Nothing is for certain yet, but Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said that legislation will be included in the Queen’s Speech on May 10. If legalized, private scooters will have to meet similar safety specifications as those in the public trials, namely max speeds of 15.5 miles per hour and automatic lights. If legalized, this will also open up a huge market to the e-scooter makers of the world, and might even spark more homegrown business. Taur, for example, is a British company that has just launched operations in Los Angeles, in large part because the U.K. was dragging its heels on this piece of legislation. It’ll also undoubtedly help English cities meet their climate goals. In the U.S., Portland has learned that emissions due to transportation are one of the main reasons the city can’t reach its emissions targets. Unfortunately, the city is considering making the problem worse by widening highways… :eyeroll-emoji: Perhaps not all hope is lost for American cities, though. They just need to get the policy to align with demand. A new study has found that e-bike sales are outpacing electric car sales in the U.S., which makes sense, given market availability of the two types of vehicles. But it’s also an encouraging finding! Many people, like parents, are also finding e-cargo bikes to be a nice replacement to the minivan as a vehicle to cart kids around. Bolt said it will invest about $158 million (€150 million) in 2022 to scale its scooter and e-bike operations to more than 230,000 scooters and e-bikes across 250+ cities. Earlier this year, the company raised a whopping $709 million, which is no doubt going to help fuel this expansion. Populus is partnering with cities and operators like Bolt, Tier and Voi in a European Union-funded, data-sharing initiative that will measure carbon reductions of micromobility. Voi is launching hundreds of e-scooters in Oslo that will be equipped with Drover AI’s computer vision, camera-based scooter ADAS tech, which will help with the ever-annoying problem of scooters on sidewalks. Cooper Bikes, which is owned by the makers of the Mini Cooper car, dropped four new e-bike models. Indian e-scooter manufacturer Dispatch says it will launch a purpose-built e-scooter (not a kick scooter, one of the moped-looking ones) in Q1 2023 that will be purpose-built to enable shared and commercial applications. Ola Electric has to recall more than 1,400 mopeds after one of them caught fire. Elon Musk’s pursuit to buy Twitter continues to have an impact on Tesla, which is why I’m back here writing about a social media platform. The latest example was revealed in a series of regulatory filings that showed he sold 9.6 million shares of Tesla, worth about $8.5 billion. Tesla shares fell more than 11% last week. Musk, who still holds about 16% of the automaker, said in a tweet on Thursday: “No further TSLA sales planned after today.” It’s unclear where the remaining funds needed in the $44 billion deal will come from. Much of Musk’s fortune is tied up in Tesla stock. A friendly reminder that if Musk backs out of the deal, he’s on the hook for $1 billion, per the termination fee of the deal with Twitter, so at least that amount would be covered by these sales. Other deals that caught my attention this week … BattGenie, a University of Washington startup that developed software to improve performance of batteries, raised $1.5 million in a seed funding round co-led by Powerhouse Ventures and VoLo Earth Ventures. The company also received a $300,000 grant from the Washington State Department of Commerce. Blink Charging has acquired U.K.-based EV charging provider EB Charging for $23.5 million, a move that might help the company expand its reach enough to keep up with some of the larger players. Crow Bicycles, a Spanish e-bike startup, has raised $325,000 that it will use to release a premium line of e-bikes this year, the company said. Dat Bike is a new Vietnamese e-motorbike startup that just raised $5.3 million in a Series A to continue designing and producing components domestically to reduce costs and improve performance. Divergent Technologies, a Los Angeles-based manufacturing startup, raised $160 million in a Series C funding round. John L. Thornton, former president of Goldman Sachs, executive chairman of Barrick Gold and board member of Ford, has joined Divergent’s board. FreeWire Technologies, the EV charging company, raised $125 million. The financing included a senior convertible note provided by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock Financial Management and a concurrent equity raise with institutional and strategic investors such as bp ventures, Riverstone Holdings, Octave Ventures, Gly Capital Management, Blue Bear Capital and Daishin Private Equity. Neuron, a Singapore-based company that has carved itself into the Australia/New Zealand market, as well as pieces of the U.K. and Canada, has just raised a $43.5 million Series B that it will use to continue pursuing limited vendor permits with cities in those markets. South 8 Technologies, a startup focused on electrolyte formulations for next-generation lithium batteries, raised $12 million in a Series A round led by Anzu Partners with participation from LG Technology Ventures, Shell Ventures, Foothill Ventures and Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation. SWTCH Energy Inc. raised $13 million in new financing to expand its EV charging products to multi-family buildings across North America. The new capital includes a $10 million Series A round led by the venture capital arm of Aligned Climate Capital and a $3 million credit facility from Silicon Valley Bank. Additional Series A investors include Landmark Management Inc., Elemental Energy, IBI Group, Active Impact Investments and Pacific Reach. Swvl, an Egyptian startup that provides shared transportation services for intercity and intracity trips, has expanded into Turkey through an acquisition of Volt Lines, a B2B transportation-as-a-service operator. The primarily stock deal was valued at around $40 million. Swvl, which earlier went public via a SPAC merger, confirmed to TechCrunch a deal to buy U.K. startup Zeelo that is estimated to be a $100 million acquisition. Baidu, the Chinese internet giant, and autonomous vehicle company Pony.ai have received permits to provide driverless ride-hailing services to the public on open roads in Beijing. Pony.ai also was awarded a permit in Guangzhou to operate 100 robotaxis as traditional taxis. Ford CEO Jim Farley hinted during the company’s first-quarter earnings call that it’s interested in expanding its partnership with autonomous vehicle technology company Argo AI to focus on middle mile deliveries. General Motors expects expenses for its autonomous driving subsidiary Cruise to be about $2 billion this year. Local Motors no longer exists with the exception of one last asset: its domain name. That is being auctioned now and as of press time the highest bid was about $8,500. The Indy Autonomous Challenge racecar, which was programmed by team PoliMOVE from Politecnico di Milano and the University of Alabama, set a new land speed world record of 192.2 miles per hour at the historic Kennedy Space Center. Michigan State University introduced the Karsan Autonomous e-ATAK bus, an electric autonomous vehicle that will run on campus. The project is through a collaboration with the Michigan Office of Mobility and Electrification, bus manufacturer Karsan and San Francisco-based AV company ADASTEC. Mobileye has begun testing its self-driving vehicles in Miami and Stuttgart. It’s unclear just how many vehicles are in either test fleet. WeRide is launching its Robosweeper, a mass-produced self-driving sweeper vehicle, in China. The company is gearing up for a large-scale road test in May with a fleet of more than 50 vehicles to be conducted in Guangzhou. Ford reported a multibillion-dollar loss in the first quarter due to an eye-popping write-off on the value of its stake in Rivian, an EV company that has seen its stock drop by nearly 70% since its IPO. Ford also revealed its supply chain strategy and expressed a positive outlook for 2022 backed by its efforts the past few years to secure battery and EV manufacturing in-house and serious demand in its EV lineup. In a separate yet related note, Amazon also reported a massive loss due to its Rivian holding. General Motors’ first-quarter earnings report and accompanying analyst call Tuesday highlighted the company’s grand ambitions for electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles — and the money it is willing to put behind them. Three items stuck out to me and reporter Jaclyn Trop: its $2 billion spending plan for Cruise, a proposal to tie the compensation packages of highest-ranking executives to EV quality and sales targets and its low-cost EV plans. Ford held a splashy event celebrating the launch of production of its new F-150 Lightning EV. During that event, CEO Jim Farley said Ford will build a second EV truck. The government of Saudi Arabia, which is connected to the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund that owns 61% of Lucid Group, agreed to buy 100,000 of the automaker’s electric vehicles over the next decade. Vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-to-home charging — also called bidirectional charging — have long been the stuff of demonstration programs. TechCrunch contributor Jim Motavalli explores whether bidirectional EV charging is ready for the home market? West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin criticized a potential expansion of the federal EV tax credit, calling it “ludicrous.” Instead, he argued that the money should be used for the development of hydrogen. Sorry y’all, this guy was in the news so much that he is getting his own section this issue. Elon Musk announced The Boring Company would attempt to build a working hyperloop, and less than a week since the company raised $675 million at a $5.7 billion valuation. A day after the hyperloop announcement, Musk tweeted that the company plans to begin “full-scale” testing of hyperloop this year. A judge rejected Musk’s attempt to terminate a 2018 settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that requires oversight of some of his Tesla-related tweets. Meanwhile, a Delaware judge sided with Musk in a $13 billion lawsuit brought by Tesla shareholders, which accused the executive of coercing the electric vehicle company’s board into buying SolarCity back in 2016. While the court found that Musk “was more involved in the process than a conflicted fiduciary should be,” it ultimately ruled in favor of the “technoking” on all counts. Shareholders still have the option to file an appeal. Nissan has tapped Luminar to help it develop a new ADAS system that it hopes will drastically reduce accidents. The automaker expects its new tech will be available on every new model by 2030. Hertz hired Ned Ryan as chief product development officer. Ryan, who most recently was at Ford, is a serial entrepreneur. He launched in 2013 a flexible rideshare financing company called Breeze that was purchased by Ford in 2016. He also founded Canvas, a vehicle subscription service that was acquired by Fair.com at the end of 2019. Passport, a transportation software and payments company, hired D. Burt Arrington as general counsel and corporate secretary. Arrington previously worked at the law firm of Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP. Morgan Motor Company hired Lamborghini executive Massimo Fumarola as CEO, replacing Steve Morris. The U.K.-based company said that Morris will become executive chairman. Nuvocargo, a logistics startup focused simplifying U.S.-Mexico cross-border trade, hired Jay Gerard as head of customs. Gerard has more than 20 years of logistics and operational management experience and was most recently Global Customs Director, North America, at Flexport. Waze hired Harris Beber as its chief marketing officer to lead all global partnerships and marketing. Harris most recently worked at Vimeo, where he scaled the company’s of 260M+ video professionals, businesses, and brands and helped take the company public in 2021. He previously served as CMO at The Nature’s Bounty Company, and held various senior marketing positions at Amazon, Shutterfly and 1-800-Flowers.com. In 2010, he sold his retail e-commerce business, Giftback. Volkswagen Group has been asked by Sen. Mark Rubio for more information regarding planned joint ventures with two Chinese companies to supply nickel, cobalt, lithium and other materials used to make batteries for electric vehicles. The companies have been accused of having a record of alleged human rights violations such as forced labor and human trafficking, Bloomberg reported.

    "content": "An outage on Monday affected web hosting giant Amazon Web Services (AWS), which took out vast swathes of the web, including websites, banks, and some government services. On Monday afternoon, the company offered an update on the cause of the issue and said it was working to restore services. At 6:01 p.m. ET, Amazon said all AWS services had returned to normal operations. In an announcement on the Amazon website, the company shared that the underlying issue was related to DNS resolution. DNS, or Domain Name System, is a system that converts web addresses into IP addresses so that customer apps and websites can load. While some glitches can be resolved quickly, DNS issues can sometimes take longer to resolve. “AWS reported increased error rates for multiple services and determined that the issue was related to DNS resolution of the DynamoDB API endpoints in the N. Virginia (us-east-1) Region,” the announcement stated. “The underlying DNS issue was fully mitigated at 2:24 AM PDT.” Though the issue itself was fixed, Amazon needed more time to “fully restore service,” which it said it was doing “as quickly as possible.” The company also said that the issue affected Amazon.com and its subsidiaries, as well as AWS customer support operations. Amazon said on Monday evening Eastern time that the outage had been “fully mitigated” and that most services are returning to normal after an hours-long stretch during which much of the internet could not load. Several major apps were not working. Coinbase, Fortnite, Signal, Perplexity, Venmo, and Zoom faced lengthy outages, as did Amazon’s own services, including its Ring video surveillance products. The outage even disrupted Eight Sleep’s cooling pods, disturbing the sleep of users. Millions of companies and organizations rely on AWS to host their websites, apps, and other critical online systems. The company has data centers all over the world, and Amazon is said to have at least 30% of the total cloud market. Before this, the most recent global internet outage was in 2024, when cybersecurity giant CrowdStrike published a buggy update to its anti-malware engine, causing millions of computers around the world to crash and resulting in airport delays and mass outages. Systems globally took several days to return to normal. Prior to that, a malfunction at DNS provider Akamai in 2021 caused some of the world’s largest websites to drop off the internet for several hours, including FedEx, Steam, and the PlayStation Network. Amazon advised customers to refer to the AWS Health Dashboard for more detailed information on the outage and how it was being resolved. Zack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "content": "It was another dizzying week here at Extra Crunch as you will shortly see in this newsletter. One change that we are making: we are simplifying our newsletters to keep you better informed on what is happening on Extra Crunch. We are merging the daily, weekly, and article editions of this newsletter into a “roundup” format that will come out twice per week. The goal is to keep the signal high, and the noise in your inbox low. To control which newsletters you receive from Extra Crunch (and TechCrunch more broadly), feel free to go to our newsletters page while logged in. And as always, if you have feedback, do let me know at danny@techcrunch.com. TechCrunch’s scooter aficionado Megan Rose Dickey dived into the current state of the scooter market, and came back decidedly non-plussed. Scooters seem like a viable solution to the last-mile problem of urban transportation, but the reality is that the sharing economics behind them are weak, and huge regulatory barriers are being erected that will almost certainly slow their advance. Even worse, sharing may disappear entirely: What’s not clear at this point in the early days of micromobility is if people are adopting the shared model or simply just adopting new forms of transportation. This is where the question of shared versus ownership comes in. “Do you get your own one of these things — a board, scooter, bike — or do you just assume super high availability and find that more convenient? Buried in that are a lot of other things,” [Shaun Abrahamson, managing partner at city and mobility-focused VC fund Urban.us, said]. “People have vehicles as sort of a fashion accessory. Maybe you want to tweak it for more performance. Having what is effectively a fleet vehicle, which will be more optimized for ruggedness, is not optimized for performance. It’s not an extension of self-expression.” This week we had many conversations about Lyft. On TechCrunch’s Equity podcast, Kate Clark and Alex Wilhelm discussed the latest ups-and-downs with Lyft’s IPO, and you can read the transcript here as a member benefit. We also conducted an Extra Crunch exclusive conference call with Kate Clark and Kirsten Korosec on Lyft, discussing the company’s past and future. If you missed the call, you can read the transcript here. From that conversation: Kirsten [Korosec]: So something to keep an eye on. It reminds me a lot of a company I write a lot about, which is Tesla, and I’ve been covering them for years. And it’s one of the most volatile stocks, and their investors, they certainly have large, institutional investors, but the number of fanboys that they have with smaller investors, either prop up the share price sometimes or add to that volatility, and I’m kind of really curious to see if that happens with Lyft. If you go to a shareholder meeting at Tesla, for example, it’s filled with people who are passionate about the brand and its CEO, Elon Musk. And Lyft and possibly Uber, if they end up finally going through with their IPO, you can see that potentially happening because people feel very strongly about the brand and also the service it provides. So I’m curious to see how this all sort of shakes out. And I tend to take the view that I invest personally in mutual funds and things like that. I don’t invest in any of these companies, but the long, patient view tends to be the better one, and trying to catch a falling knife, as investors have told me, is never really a good idea. Talking about ridesharing and transcripts, one experimental feature we have been trialing with Extra Crunch is offering transcripts of popular podcast episodes relevant to the membership. This week, we have the transcript of a ‘This is Your Life in Silicon Valley’ episode interviewing the New York Times’ Mike Isaac on Uber’s situation with the press. Isaac also talked about the process of acquiring leaks: So you cover Facebook. You cover a lot. One thing I’m really curious about is just not speaking specifically about Facebook but the companies you cover, Uber, et cetera. Tell me about leaks. So employee leaks, so there’s this whole phenomenon of you get these leaks. Are they increasing? How does a leak even work? I mean, I don’t have any sources obviously, but just tactically speaking, when someone leaks something to you, how does that even work? I have found, you know what’s really funny? Historically Facebook is not a leaky company. They have actually had a really good reputation for being super tight. It’s hard to break in there. And I’ve written about them for probably like 10 years now. I starting writing about them in 2010. That’s back when everything was happy. Right, no, when Facebook was still like cool, when youngs were on it, when it wasn’t just old guys like us farting around and taking pics. And so back in the day, you sort of like bought into this cult of Facebook. Everyone loved it, and all the people that were there working there really liked it. The thing that I notice with companies, and I wrote about Uber last year during its insanity and downfall is that leaks are just a symptom of bigger problems inside of the company. When people leak, when people talk to people like me, it’s because they’re usually unhappy or they have some sort of motivation to do so because they’re trying to get some sort of result. I mean, that’s one of the reasons: They’re trying to get some sort of result. So Facebook is having, if you just watch the news, more leaks than they ever had probably in their history, and that’s because people are just not happy. And they’re starting to really grapple with the idea that maybe things they’re doing are not all good, or maybe the company is not entirely a positive force for the world. If you are sick and tired of ridesharing and want to get away from the urban hubs (or just rainy San Francisco), remote work might be just the ticket. Our writer Sherwood Morrison dives into the growing clout of remote workers in the tech industry: Moving around slowly, on the other hand, can offer significant benefits. Matt Mullenweg, whose startup Automattic is the second-largest remote company, advises approaching travel strategically. “With proper planning, travel can allow you to bootstrap community in different locations, connect with customers, meet non-traditional investors or advisors, and recruit talented colleagues outside of the normal fishing grounds of the internet giants. Something closer to ‘slowmad’ than ‘nomad’ is probably the right approach,” he told TechCrunch. We sent out an article-specific email this week, but in case you didn’t catch it all (hah!), TechCrunch editor Greg Kumparak published his second part of the Niantic EC-1, focused on the challenges the company experienced in building and launching Pokémon GO. I have part three in my hands as I write this, and I’m looking forward to publishing the final two parts of this popular series. Niantic nearly failed in its launch of Pokémon GO due to scaling struggles with Google Cloud. Our enterprise writer Ron Miller discusses the issue of the public cloud and its relation with startups, finding that the alternatives always seem better than they really are: There have been multiple attempts to break the Amazon hegemony around the cloud market, including the aforementioned competition from Microsoft and others. Perhaps the most visible open-source attempt was OpenStack, which was launched as a joint open-source project between Rackspace and NASA in 2010. The mission was to come up with an open-source way to manage public and private clouds. One of the primary motivations for this was that companies were looking for a way to take advantage of the public cloud without getting dependent on these commercial systems, which primarily meant AWS at the time. While OpenStack worked in its own way, it never really gained as much traction as was hoped at the time, beyond some high-profile customers like the telecom market, along with Walmart and Comcast. Legendary Wall Street investor Peter Kraus’ next mission is to go after the passive investment industry typified by index fund giant Vanguard and startups like Wealthfront. With his new venture Aperture, he wants to bring back the mutual fund — yes, that antiquated investment model — for a new generation of investors. Our fintech writer Gregg Schoenberg has the two-part interview and the scoop on this latest financial innovation (read part 1 here, and part 2 here). GS: I agree with you on that and took note when you launched some fulcrum funds at AllianceBernstein. But to me, the story here is that you would lead with mutual funds in a new entity in 2019. Can you go deeper on that? PK: As I said before, ETFs are essentially derivatives. To put it differently, the ETF is a representation of a basket of securities that is publicly disclosed to the whole of the ETF. When you buy and sell the ETF, what happens is the underlying securities have to actually change hands. In order for these underlying securities to change hands, two authorized persons independent of the ETF literally have to buy and sell those securities. GS: For those that don’t understand the inner workings of ETFs, which is basically everyone on the planet, what is the importance of that distinction? PK: It is illogical to believe that someone can charge zero for a product, make no revenue and continue to offer that product forever. There is an underlying assumption that this liquidity or exchange process happens seamlessly at a very low cost to you, the holder of the ETF. When the markets are benign, that pretty much happens. But when markets become volatile, though, then the buyer and the seller of those underlying securities could be saying to themselves, “What’s the price of that security?” PK: Maybe I have to widen out the bid-ask spread, so now the cost is getting bigger. Maybe one of them says, “You might fail to deliver that security, so I’m not actually going to make a market in that security or I’m not going to accept that as a transaction.” One of the underlying themes of the past few years has been the increasing power — and therefore responsibility — of technology and the companies that harness it. More fundamentally though, how do we define tech ethics? What does it mean to be ethical when we are building products for the future? TechCrunch’s local humanist and ethicist Greg Epstein put together a roundtable with three leading scholars to discuss the meanings and contours of tech ethics today. Once you get past ethics, how do you actually create systems of compliance? We have two pieces on that front this week. First, startup attorney and founder Daniel McKenzie put together a comprehensive overview and checklist of all the regulatory matters required of startups in their first years of existence. This is a continuation of his Startup Law A-to-Z series that we have been running the past few weeks on Extra Crunch. Second, Lisa Hawke discusses the rise of dark data (data that isn’t visible to companies) and its implications for regulation and compliance. As data continues to flood into startups, how do you manage risks of data that you often cannot see? Hawke writes: What are some specific risks and challenges related to dark data? These can range from producing evidence in litigation (e.g. ediscovery) to a company’s ability to adhere to applicable regulations, such as data preservation and privacy laws. For example, GDPR presumes organizations know exactly what data they hold, making it important to understand if the company stores dark data (and where it is). It’s also important to consider security risk, which boils down to the fact that an organization can’t secure something if it doesn’t know about it at all (or where it is). Our media columnist Eric Peckham discussed the future of media with Northzone’s Pär-Jörgen Pärson. Northzone has become one of the leading media investors in Europe and around the world through their tenacious focus on the end user, and Pärson offers frank opinions on the state of affairs in the industry. Peckham: Were there things that you predicted would happen in media, say five years ago, that didn’t happen? Pärson: My hopes were too high that the established media houses would see the dangers of jumping into bed with Facebook and Google. [That they would see] they were being totally sacked and undermined by those companies. Instead, the response has been extremely shortsighted, not even tactical and definitely not strategic. I think they have even shortened their lifespan over the past five years. I thought that they would fight back in at least some sort of productive way. But they’re just laying down flat to die. Eric’s other passion besides media is education. He and I spent a good hour talking about the future of an increasingly popular new form of education financing known as the income share agreement. ISAs are being used by edtech startups like Lambda School in order to increase access to education while also improving incentives for the provider to offer a first-rate program. Eric: When you see people talk about this on Twitter they frame it as like venture capital or angel investing for individuals. And that’s not what it is. I mean, you could approach it from that perspective. But none of the programs out there that I’ve seen are doing that and most likely there will be regulation that prevents you from doing that. It’s pretty standard that these have a cap on the total amount of money that can be earned back – somewhere in the 1.5x to 2.5x range. It’s not about making money off one outlier student, it’s about investing in all the students who are part of a certain program – a class in a university or a software development boot camp. Within that portfolio, some students are financial losses and some of profitable, and by diversifying your risk you hope to net a stable return. The better the education program, the better market terms for ISAs. If you have made it down this far, you are a badass. Our final piece this week zoomed in on Snap’s announcement that it will start to prioritize gaming as part of its new engagement model. TechCrunch’s intrepid Asia reporter Jon Russell compared Snap’s new initiative to existing chatting apps in Asia, and finds some hope in the model: Social games won’t bring new users to Snap — blockbusters like Fortnite, PUBG or Apex Legends are what moves the market — but they might galvanize existing groups and increase engagement. Ultimately, it really depends on the quality of the titles. To every member of Extra Crunch: thank you.

    "content": "OpenAI announced Tuesday the launch of its AI-powered browser, ChatGPT Atlas, a major step in the company’s quest to unseat Google as the main way people find information online. The company says Atlas will first roll out on macOS, with support for Windows, iOS, and Android coming soon. OpenAI says the product will be available to all free users at launch. Browsers have quickly become the AI industry’s next battleground. While Google Chrome has long dominated the space, there’s a sense that AI chatbots and agents are fundamentally changing how people get work done online. A handful of startups have tried to capture this by launching AI-powered browsers of their own, such as Perplexity’s Comet and The Browser Company’s Dia. Google and Microsoft have also tried to update Chrome and Edge, respectively, with AI-powered features to make their legacy products stand out. OpenAI’s Engineering Lead for Atlas, Ben Goodger, said in a livestream Tuesday that ChatGPT is core to the company’s first browser. Users in ChatGPT Atlas can chat with their search results, much like in Perplexity or in Google’s AI Mode. The killer feature for other AI-powered browsers has been the built-in chatbot that sits in a side panel and automatically has context for whatever’s on your screen. It may sound minor, but many users spend all day copying and pasting text or dragging files and links into ChatGPT, just to provide context. The sidecar feature removes that friction and makes for a smoother user experience. OpenAI’s Product Lead, Adam Fry, said during the livestream that ChatGPT Atlas will have the sidecar feature, too. Further, ChatGPT Atlas has “browser history,” meaning that ChatGPT can now log the websites you visit and what you do on them, and use that information to make its answers more personalized. AI-powered browsers also commonly feature an AI agent that aims to automate web-based tasks on behalf of users. In TechCrunch’s testing, we’ve found the early versions of web-browsing AI agents leave something to be desired. While Perplexity’s Comet and OpenAI’s ChatGPT agent work well for simple tasks, they struggle to reliably automate the more cumbersome problems users might want to offload to an AI system. Sure enough, OpenAI’s browser has a web-browsing agent too. By using “agent mode,” users can ask ChatGPT to complete small tasks in the browser on their behalf. The company says agent mode is only available to ChatGPT users on the Plus, Pro, and Business tier at launch. In an interview at OpenAI’s DevDay conference, Head of ChatGPT Nick Turley told TechCrunch that he’s inspired by the way browsers have redefined what an operating system can look like. Turley noted that browsers have revolutionized the way people get work done online, and he thinks ChatGPT is a similar phenomenon. Whether OpenAI’s browser can put a dent in Google Chrome, which has more than 3 billion users around the globe, remains to be seen. AI browsers are quite buzzy in Silicon Valley today, but their impact in the broader world is limited. Maxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

    "content": "The 9th Annual Crunchies are fast approaching, with the event best described as the Oscars of Startup and Technology taking place on February 8 at San Francisco’s War Memorial Opera House. Some of your favorite startups, entrepreneurs and investors will be competing to win a coveted Crunchie award in one of 12 categories up for grabs. The Best Technology Achievement Crunchie goes to the products that reflect true excellence in their fields, products that made waves in the tech landscape in 2015. There are several great products up for the award this year, so let’s take a look at this year’s finalists, as well as those companies that have won the award in previous years. With the launch of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, Apple fundamentally changed the way we interact with our iPhones with 3D touch. The iPhone’s screen now recognizes how much pressure you apply to your phone, and lets you essentially preview and act on things like emails, photos, addresses and more without ever leaving the app you’re using. For example, when in Mail, you can lightly press and hold to preview an email, then either let go to return to your inbox or press a little harder to open it. If there’s one product that is ushering us into our Minority Report-like future, it’s Microsoft’s HoloLens, the company’s “holographic” computing wearable headset. HoloLens users use gestures to interact with a 3D virtual world, letting them work and play in multiple dimensions. Basically, it’s a computer that you attach to your face that overlays images and objects in your living room. Falcon 9 is a two-stage rocket designed and manufactured by SpaceX to transport satellites and the company’s Dragon spacecraft into orbit. The Falcon 9’s first stage rocket is designed to be reusable, and in December, the Falcon 9 achieved a huge milestone by successfully launching and landing the rocket on land for the first time. Back in October, Tesla rolled out an over-the-air update for the company’s fleet that brought a desired new feature to the company’s vehicles: autopilot. Tesla’s vehicles can now change lanes, keep a safe distance from other vehicles and maintain your speed. You can see our hands-on (or hands-off?) with Tesla auto-pilot here. Transatomic Power is a company that’s looking to bring nuclear power back, but in a much safer way. The company is currently working to develop a waste-annihilating molten salt reactor, a reactor that converts high-level nuclear waste into clean, carbon-free electric power that eliminates the awful waste generated by most nuclear reactors. Earthmine – 1st Annual Crunchies Winner Earthmine was a company that used vehicle-mounted camera systems to capture 3D, spherical street-level images similar to Google Earth and Google Street View. The service was acquired by Nokia on November 2012. Windows Live Mesh – 2nd Annual Crunchies Winner Windows Live Mesh was an early cloud storage service from Microsoft that let users sync files, folders and other things across multiple PCs and in the cloud. It was, in essence, a precursor to what SkyDrive is today, and the company shut down Live Mesh in 2013. Chrome OS – 3rd Annual Crunchies Winner Unlike the first two winners, Google’s Chrome OS is still around, and Google says it’s alternative desktop and laptop operating system is here to stay. The operating system is basically a spiffed up version of the Chrome browser, but also runs several apps from the Chrome Web Store, as well as a smattering of Android apps. Google Self Driving Cars – 4th Annual Crunchies Winner Google wowed the world with its secret fleet of automated Toyota Priuses in 2010. The company’s self-driving vehicles may look a lot different now, and it definitely drives like your grandparents, but the company is aggressively moving self-driving car technology forward so that your next vehicle might actually drive itself. Siri – 5th Annual Crunchies Winner Apple’s Siri digital assistant needs no introduction — chances are you’ve either used Siri at some point today or have been around someone who for some reason decided to use Siri with the volume cranked way up. iPhone users can use Siri to do all sorts of things like making dinner reservations, finding out what movies are playing, and even controlling your HomeKit-enabled accessories. Mars Curiosity Rover – 6th Annual Crunchies Winner NASA’s Curiosity rover is a roughly car-sized robotic rover exploring the Red Planet of Mars, looking at things like the Martian climate and geology, determining if the planet was ever able to sustain life, and figuring out whether the planet is habitable for future human exploration. You can follow the Curiosity rover on Twitter, if you’re so inclined. Bitcoin – 7th Annual Crunchies Winner Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital open-source payment system that is officially categorized as a decentralized virtual currency by the U.S. Treasury. The currency has been doing pretty well of late, now hovering above the $400 mark for the first time since 2014. Stella Solar Powered Car – 8th Annual Crunchies Winner Stella is a four-seater, solar-powered vehicle that, unlike most solar vehicles out there, is designed to be a normal family car. It took first place at the World Solar Challenge in 2013, and it can run for 500 miles on a single charge from the large solar panel on the top of the vehicle. Which of the projects up for the Best Technology Achievement award will join the prestigious class of past winners? The winner will be announced at the 9th Annual Crunchies on February 8, and if you somehow don’t have your tickets yet, they are still available on our ticketing page for as low as $115.

    "content": "A developer platform for the…sky? That’s the vision of OurSky, a startup founded last year that’s aiming to make space observational data more accessible via a software platform and global telescope network. The company announced that it closed $9.5 million in seed funding led by Upfront Ventures alongside Oceans Ventures, Venrex Investment Management, Marlinspike Partners and Embedded Ventures, to further accelerate deployment of scopes and the developer platform. CEO and co-founder Dan Roelker likened OurSky to AWS for developers or the web3 development platform Alchemy: “Alchemy [provided] this platform that was really easy for developers to get the data and process it the way they needed to without standing up their own, in our case, telescope network. That’s really hard to do. Now all that’s abstracted away, and you’re just telling and programming the OurSky platform to get the data, process it the way you want.” Critically, the startup says it’s a modern and less costly alternative to the status quo, with development tools and open APIs that can be used by companies spanning space situational awareness startups to satellite operators. OurSky was founded by Roelker and serial technology entrepreneur Alex Hawkinson in October 2022. It almost seems fated: During the pandemic, Roelker and his family moved to an area outside of Washington, D.C., and one of their neighbors turned out to be Hawkinson. In addition to founding companies, Hawkinson is also an avid amateur astronomer. He and Roelker quickly realized there was a critical need for a developer platform that can access and analyze real-time data on space objects. The two got to work. Roelker has worked in software his entire career. His resume includes founding a few reverse-engineering hacker groups (which were acquired by the likes of BAE Systems and Raytheon), working as SpaceX’s VP of software engineering from 2015 to 2019 and joining NFT marketplace OpenSea as VP of engineering. He was at SpaceX during a particularly pivotal time in the company, and his work spanned the Falcon, Falcon Heavy, Dragon and Starship programs. “When I joined SpaceX, we had just blown up a rocket with CRS-7,” he said. “The next launch was basically the make-or-break launch for SpaceX. […] It was a very exciting time because I was there for four years, and I went through the whole lifecycle. The first launch we had with me at the helm of flight software for Falcon was the first time we landed a rocket.” OurSky is tackling different challenges — including building out the world’s largest telescope network. The network has three sources: scopes that OurSky owns and deploys; scopes sourced from the professional amateur community (think people that have extremely capable telescopes that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars); and scopes from the far larger amateur community. The Los Angeles, California-based startup already has 30 scopes under ownership deployed in nine locations globally, and has onboarded around 35 amateur astronomers on its network. It’s using different incentives to attract amateurs onto the platform — Roelker was very clear that OurSky is not trying to “monetize” the amateur community — and these incentives include free access to otherwise complicated and time-consuming capabilities like image stacking for astrophotographers. With the new round, OurSky isn’t planning on just buying up a bunch of telescopes — maintenance costs are exorbitant, Roelker said — but instead tying into existing infrastructures to build out a collective network. That way, OurSky isn’t saddled with a bunch of fiddly hardware. “We are of course going to buy telescopes, and we have, but that’s not going to be the bulk of the money. The bulk of the money is very much around building out the software platform in a way that is going to support all these different needs from research to commercial to defense to the consumer applications for space observation. The company has grown to 15 people, with the aim of expanding to 20 in around six months. This incremental growth is part of OurSky’s larger strategy to carefully allocate capital in order to keep pace with how the market develops in the next year or two, Roelker said. “We want to make sure that we’re using this investment wisely with a much further time frame. […] I think the name of the game is, we have to be capital efficient, not just in how we build a network, but really, we’re looking at longer time frames here so we can roll with the market as it evolves over the next year or two. We wanted to make sure we had enough capital to be able to go with that evolution.” Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "content": "SpaceX is in the business of launching rockets, but it will look to supplement that business through other revenue opportunities; specifically, it anticipates a global satellite internet business will drive as much as $30 billion in revenue per year by 2025. That’s an ambitious target, but financials analyzed by The Wall Street Journal for the private company suggest that it’s a key ingredient to help SpaceX shore up thin margins in its rocket launch device. Those margins are feeling pressure from the pre-launch explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket on a launchpad in September, 2016. That explosion not only destroyed a functional Falcon 9, but also a payload containing Facebook’s $200 million satellite. SpaceX was already launching rockets at a fraction of the price of its competitors, which is why it’s been able to build up a $10 billion contract buffer in terms of scheduled future launches — but in doing so, it’s cutting pretty close to the quick in terms of profit potential. That explosion also led to a four-month stoppage of any launches, which, given SpaceX’s aggressive pace for sending things into space, has had a significant impact on its ability to make good on existing contracts and recoup revenue. And this follows a 2015 mid-flight explosion, which led to a roughly $260 million loss for that year, and a 6 percent overall drop in revenue, after small operating profits recorded in both 2013 and 2014. In 2016, it launched only eight rockets, versus its projected 20, which is bound to have a significant impact on its revenue for this most recent full calendar year, too. SpaceX’s $60 million average launch cost is key to its ability to continue to land contracts and attract customers, and it’s also key to its larger goal of reaching Mars by 2024. That will require further cost reductions, which SpaceX hopes to achieve by reusing its rocket components and improving its manufacturing processes. But 2016 has definitely been a financial challenge, and it’s unlikely the company hit its forecasts of $1.8 billion in revenue, and $55 million in operating profit, thanks to setbacks. The plan the company has developed for launching satellite-based internet was revealed in more detail when SpaceX filed an application with the FCC to deploy 4,425 satellites in order to provide high-speed internet access world-wide. Each satellite is roughly the size of a sub-compact car. When completed, the network should be able to provide speeds of around 1 Gbps for subscribers on the ground, which is around the speed of current gigabit fiber optic networks, and much faster than most users with cable connections enjoy today. SpaceX received a $1 billion investment from Google and Fidelity in 2015, and Alphabet also recently shut down its own Titan drone-based global internet deployment project, so the backing of Musk’s plan might actually grow now that the Google parent is looking beyond its own drone project for ways to accomplish its goals of opening up global internet accessibility more broadly. Still, SpaceX’s financials, as revealed by The Wall Street Journal’s rare backstage look, place a lot of faith in the ability of this global internet service to not only be up and running by 2018, but to create a lot of profit only a few years after that. A lot is riding on the company’s planned return to active launch status on Saturday, but this puts those stakes in even starker relief.

    "content": "Over the weekend, SpaceX revealed that there was no damage found on their recovered Falcon 9 and it was ready to be fired again. SpaceX CEO, Elon Musk, shared some of the first photos of the rocket from a hangar at Cape Canaveral. The recovered Falcon 9 was launched to space on December 21st and brought back safely to the ground. Many labeled this achievement as a game changer for the rocket industry. Elon can’t say this, but “nail in the coffin” for traditional launch industry. No way to compete with Falcon-Reusability & performance. — Peter Diamandis (@PeterDiamandis) December 22, 2015 Falcon 9 back in the hangar at Cape Canaveral. No damage found, ready to fire again. https://t.co/7w6IfJGtXM — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 1, 2016 Musk tweeted that the recovered rocket was ready to fire again. However, it’s not likely to be used for another launch. Instead, it will simply be used in a static fire test. In a press call after the successful landing, Musk said, “I think we’ll probably keep this one on the ground, just… it’s kind of unique, it’s the first one we’ve brought back.” To many, this recovered rocket is a national treasure and belongs in a museum. To SpaceX, it’s the first rocket they’ve successfully brought back after a mission. They probably want to test the hell out of it to understand exactly what happens to a rocket after it’s launched and recovered. These tests could put the rocket through its paces and it may be too risky to use it for another launch. If the first recovered rocket failed on its second flight, it would place an enormous setback on the path to rocket reusability. A static fire test means that the rocket will be held down to the ground as the engines are fired and analyzed. SpaceX will use this test to verify that the recovered rocket would work in the event that they wanted to use it for a second flight. Musk has stated that within the next year they plan to launch over a dozen flights and that they will “probably” try to re-fly one of their recovered boosters in the same time-frame. So it may be a while before we see a recovered rocket used for a second flight. The reasons to be patient with reusing a rocket are obvious. Placing a multi-million dollar payload on top of a mint condition rocket is risky enough. Future SpaceX customers will want undeniable proof that their ride to space is in perfect condition before betting their payload on it. The image of the returned rocket may be enough to make future customers nervous. A launch is an intense experience and the image of the retrieved rocket shows that much of it is covered in soot. We can compare this image to a photo of the rocket prior to launch. The dark parts on the rocket after launch are due to soot accumulated from the launch. The clean, triangular white spaces along the bottom end were created by the landing legs that were folded up during launch. Some have theorized that the clean space around the middle may be due to the liquid oxygen (LOX) tank that’s held there. The LOX would keep that part of the rocket very cold and prevent hot ash from scorching or sticking to that area. SpaceX isn’t the only company working on rocket reusability. In November, Jeff Bezos’ company, Blue Origin, also brought their rocket, New Shepard, back to the ground in a less technically difficult landing after launching it to space. And in April, the United Launch Alliance announced early plans of their own reusable rocket, the Vulcan. Reusable rockets are expected to cut launch costs by more than half. Musk has stated that the cost of a Falcon 9 is around $60 million to manufacture while the fuel itself is only $200,000. But the path to rocket reusability will be a long one, and it’s going to get more expensive before it gets cheaper. Safely landing the rocket is simply the first step. SpaceX will need to conduct further tests to prove that recovered rockets are consistently reliable. Safely retrieving a rocket after a launch (rather than tossing it away in the ocean) has clear cost benefits. But for any type of savings to be realized, a customer will need to purchase a launch on a recovered SpaceX Falcon 9. Safely returning a rocket to Earth after it’s been to space is impressive alone, but securing companies willing to put their products on a reused rocket will be the necessary key to unlock the benefits of reusability.

    "content": "On Sunday morning, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket broke apart nearly 30 miles above Cape Canaveral just a few minutes after launch, marking its first full mission failure. The rocket was taking the Dragon capsule, carrying more than 4,000 pounds of supplies, to the International Space Station (ISS). SpaceX had previously completed six successful resupply missions to the ISS, the latest one in April. While there were no humans on board and no accidents on the ground, the lost cargo contained over 4,000 pounds of food, water, and science experiments for the crew on station. William Gerstenmaier, NASA associate administrator for human exploration and operations, stated that the ISS crew will be fine and has sufficient supplies for the next four months. The next ISS resupply mission is scheduled to launch on July 3rd with the Russian Progress 60P vehicle. The exact cause of the Falcon 9 failure is unknown at this time, but Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX tweeted: There was an overpressure event in the upper stage liquid oxygen tank. Data suggests counterintuitive cause. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 28, 2015 In the NASA press briefing following the accident, SpaceX was asked if there was anything that was done differently for this launch than in the previous six launches. SpaceX’s president, Gwynne Shotwell, responded, “There’s nothing that stands out as being different for this particular flight.” SpaceX will now lead an accident investigation, making use of telemetry from 3,000 different channels that were transmitting information during the launch. “If there’s something there, we’re going to find it,” Shotwell said. An unlucky series of events makes this the third failed resupply mission to the ISS in the past eight months. An Orbital Sciences resupply mission failed in October, the exact cause of which continues to be disputed. And in May, a Russian resupply mission was placed in the wrong orbit, forcing its cargo to burn up in the Earth’s atmosphere. In addition to providing supplies to the ISS, this launch was going to be SpaceX’s third attempt to softly land the first stage of their two-stage Falcon 9 on a platform in the sea. If they succeeded, it would have been the first time a rocket has ever been fully recovered for reuse. About ten minutes after launch, SpaceX intended to detach the first stage of the Falcon 9 from the upper stage and cargo, flip the first stage 180 degrees, have it reenter into the Earth’s atmosphere faster than the speed of sound, and steer it to a floating barge in the sea. If that sounds difficult, it’s because it is. SpaceX’s first two attempts at this complex strategy impressively ended up on target. However, they both resulted in violent explosions. The first attempt occurred in January and failed because the rocket prematurely ran out of the hydraulic fluid used to steer the small fins that help control the rocket’s descent. Because of this, it landed with too much lateral force and exploded on impact. The second attempt, packed with more hydraulic fluid, occurred in April and was much closer to sticking the landing. The hydraulic fluid and controlled descent weren’t an issue, however the rocket engine fired a few seconds longer than it should have. These critical seconds caused the rocket to temporarily lose control in the last few moments before landing, ultimately tipping over and exploding. SpaceX posted that they understood the cause of this failed landing well, and have made “changes to help prevent, and be able to rapidly recover from, similar issues for the next attempt.” As this Sunday’s launch has shown, a standard rocket launch is difficult enough without adding in the complexity of reusability. So why has SpaceX dedicated more time, effort, and money to this strategy? The goal is to revolutionize the business of rocket launches. All rockets launched today are mostly expendable after just one flight. It’s like an airline throwing a jumbo jet away after a one-way trip across the country. If that were the norm, all airlines would jack up ticket prices so that only the elite few could afford to fly. SpaceX aims to change that strategy, and they’re not the only companies working to do so. Blue Origin is testing a reusable suborbital rocket called New Shepard which will be used for space tourism. SpaceX and Blue Origin have been the only companies to actually test a reusable rocket so far. However, back in April, one of SpaceX’s biggest competitors announced plans to join the rocket reusability club. United Launch Alliance (ULA), which competes with SpaceX for large government contracts, released plans for their new rocket, the Vulcan. This is undoubtedly an attempt to find a better way to match SpaceX unprecedented low launch prices. The Vulcan is early in the concept design phase, but will eventually be reused in a completely different manner than the Falcon 9. Rather than recovering the first stage from a vertical landing, it will attempt to capture the most expensive parts of the rocket in mid-air using a helicopter. This may sound crazy, but it is actually a technique the US Air Force used back in the 1960’s to recover film canisters from orbiting satellites. While ULA is further behind in their development of a reusable rocket, the company has launched 96 missions with only two partial failures since 2006. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 has launched 19 times with one partial, and as of Sunday, one full failure since 2010. In an industry where reliability trumps all else, ULA now has the edge. The race for reliability and innovation continues among private companies in the space industry. While this failure was certainly a setback for NASA and SpaceX, both parties have expressed determination in finding the root cause and returning back to flight as quickly as possible.

    "content": "Last week the space tourism company Blue Origin became the first company to launch a rocket into space and land it safely back down on the ground. The concept seems simple enough. Yet, to the space industry, this is an historic accomplishment because it means a big step toward rocket reusability. Blue Origin founder, Jeff Bezos, announced the feat with his very first tweet. The rarest of beasts – a used rocket. Controlled landing not easy, but done right, can look easy. Check out video: https://t.co/9OypFoxZk3 — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 24, 2015 Currently, there are no working reusable rockets on the market. When you launch something into space on a rocket it’s a one and done mission. You throw away nearly the entire launch vehicle, which means millions of dollars going to waste. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has likened this to throwing away a $300 million 747 after just one flight. We can imagine how expensive airplane tickets would be if that were the case. Some have estimated that a reusable rocket could cut the cost of a launch 100 fold. To be certain, this would be a true game changer for the space industry. However, the space industry is more diverse today than ever before and not all reusable rockets are created equal. After Blue Origin’s successful test many suggested that SpaceX, who is working on their own reusable orbital rocket, was falling behind. SpaceX has attempted to softly land the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket after returning from space on a barge in the ocean two separate times. Both tests ended in explosions. Musk was quick to point out the difference between his Falcon 9 and Bezos’ New Shepard shortly after congratulating the Blue Origin founder. Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 24, 2015 Getting to space needs ~Mach 3, but GTO orbit requires ~Mach 30. The energy needed is the square, i.e. 9 units for space and 900 for orbit. Blue Origin’s suborbital rocket, New Shepard, is designed to carry up to six paying passengers briefly to space (100 kilometers altitude) and right back down to the ground. SpaceX rockets are designed to be able to bring payloads into, not just orbit, but all the way up to geostationary transfer orbit (or GTO as Musk refers to in his tweet), which can be as high as 90,000 kilometers altitude. As one can imagine, these two different altitudes require very different rocket capabilities. Musk points out that getting to space only requires Mach 3 speeds while traveling to GTO requires Mach 30. However, it is important to note that the first stage that SpaceX is attempting to recover is not reaching this altitude or speed. In fact the Falcon 9 first stage doesn’t reach orbit before it is landed and recovered. Musk acknowledged this but noted that the Falcon 9 first stage is a bulkier rocket than New Shepard. @TobiasVdb The F9 booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite. Blue Origin spokesperson, Jessica Pieczonka, said “SpaceX is only trying to recover their first stage booster, which is of course suborbital. The SpaceX first stage does an in-space deceleration burn to make their re-entry more benign. If anything, the Blue Origin booster may be the one that flies through the harsher re-entry environment. Finally, the hardest part is probably the final landing segment which is the same for both boosters.” The two companies seem determined to compare themselves to each other, even though it’s a bit like comparing apples to oranges. The SpaceX Falcon 9 flies to an altitude of 124 miles, compared to New Shepard’s 62 mile peak altitude. Additionally, Falcon 9 is traveling around Mach 6 before falling back to Earth. In addition to the peak altitude and speed difference, the Falcon 9 first stage is also is a completely different orientation before coming in for landing. While New Shepard remains mostly vertical, the Falcon 9 first stage is in a horizontal configuration, requiring SpaceX to do a complex flip maneuver before it comes in for a vertical landing. This XKCD article explains that, “getting to space is easy. The problem is staying there.” Staying there requires a vehicle to go very, very fast, which is why SpaceX rockets are larger and more powerful than the spacecraft and rockets from suborbital companies like Blue Origin or even Virgin Galactic. Musk goes on to taunt Bezos by stating that SpaceX already achieved successful VTOL (Vertical Take Off and Landing) rocket tests back in 2013. Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL flight began 2013. Orbital water landing 2014. Orbital land landing next. https://t.co/S6WMRnEFY5 This is a bit misleading. Blue Origin is still the first company to successfully complete a VTOL test where the rocket actually reached space. The first part of Musk’s tweet refers to the SpaceX Grasshopper program which completed multiple successful VTOL tests, but the rocket was only launched to as high as 744 meters, less than 1% the altitude that the New Shepard rocket reached. Musk’s second sentence refers to SpaceX’s tests to launch the Falcon 9 to orbit and bring back the first stage to land softly on barge in the ocean. None of these tests so far have been successful. So while Blue Origin successfully completed a VTOL spaceflight and SpaceX has yet to successfully complete one of their own, it’s not entirely fair to compare the two companies’ achievements to date. Their successes could be considered separate unique milestones on two different paths. Blue Origin is positioning themselves to sell directly to customers (wealthy space tourists) whereas SpaceX has positioned themselves to sell to large companies and the government (Orbital Sciences, NASA, Air Force, etc). These two strategies require vastly different rocket capabilities. Even so, whatever type of rocket is being built, adding in the capability of reusability is a new, formally unachievable feat. With the news of New Shepard’s successful VTOL test, Blue Origin has started on the path of changing the very nature of rocket launches for suborbital flight.

Hi friends and first-time readers. Welcome back to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B. I’m your host Kirsten Korosec, senior transportation reporter at TechCrunch. Remember please reach out and email me at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com to share thoughts, criticisms, offer up opinions or tips. You can also send a direct message to me at Twitter — @kirstenkorosec. Typically this space is where I philosophize about a specific event and emerging transportation trend. This week, let’s all take a pause to remember Jessi Combs, who was officially and posthumously declared to hold the fastest land speed record by a woman. The Guinness Book of World Records certified this week the 522.783 mph land speed record that Combs achieved August 27, 2019 in the Alvord Desert in Oregon. Combs died after her vehicle crashed during that run. It’s the first time a new record has been set in this category in more than 40 years. Kitty O’Neil held the record with her 512.7 mph run set back in 1976. Here’s to you Jessi, the fastest woman on earth. Did anyone have trouble keeping up with all the deals, virtual automotive reveals and policy decisions this week? Yeah. Me too. Let’s get to it. Vamos. A couple of cities are emerging as new battlegrounds for the shared e-scooter market. New York City is a biggie. This week, the New York City Council approved a bill that will require the New York Department of Transportation to create a pilot program for the operation of shared electric scooters in the city. The DOT now has until October 15, 2020 to issue a request for proposals to participate in a shared e-scooter pilot program. The pilot program must launch by March 1, 2021. The NY council will continue to work with DOT on determining where to set up the pilot (this is the important part). If the pilot program limits the service area it could prove a failure, several e-scooter companies and advocates told me. We know it won’t include Manhattan. That leaves four other boroughs. Just about every e-scooter company — and a number of other less known players — are planning to apply for the permit. The next nine months promises a lot of lobbying activity. These firms are already busy, according to our sources. Stay tuned! The NY city council also approved two laws about the use of privately owned electric bikes and scooters. Meanwhile, Apple has finally added a new biking feature to Maps. The newest version of iOS is bringing a host of new features to Maps, including a dedicated cycling option that will optimize paths for bicyclists and even let users know if the route includes challenging hills. Apple Maps has included public transit and walking in previous iterations. But the biking option has been the most requested, according to Apple senior director Stacey Lysik. Amazoooooxxxxx. Zamazon? It’s a thing now. In case you missed it, Amazon acquired Zoox. There have been rumors, speculation and reports about the fate of self-driving vehicle startup for months now. The WSJ had the first report in May that Amazon was in talks to acquire the self-driving company. The official announcement, which was issued Friday morning, didn’t reveal much about the terms of the deal except that Zoox CEO Aicha Evans and co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson will continue to lead Zoox as a standalone business. As you might expect, there was nary a financial figure in sight. The Financial Times put the deal at $1.2 billion and The Information pegged it at “more than $1 billion.” Either way, the acquisition price was well below the $3.2 billion valuation Zoox had achieved two years before. It wasn’t a secret that Zoox was struggling to raise a large enough round. As I’ve stated numerous times before, Zoox has the kind of ambitions that require a mountain of capital. And by mountain, I mean far north of $1 billion. The company isn’t just building the full self-driving stack — essentially the suite of hardware and software that replaces a human driver. It took on the design and development of a new bidirectional electric vehicle with no steering wheel and it plans to operate a ride-hailing service as well. The upshot: Zoox didn’t have a lot of options. Many automakers, Tier 1 suppliers and tech companies had already formed their various alliances and partnerships, leaving Zoox on its own. Amazon certainly has the resources to help it hit its lofty goals. That is, IF Amazon doesn’t change those goals for Zoox. For now, Amazon is publicly sticking to Zoox’ mission to build and operate a fleet of robotaxis. And we can expect more Amazon flexing in the transportation industry. The e-commerce announced this week a $2 billion Climate Pledge Fund to invest in sustainable technologies and services that will help the company reach its commitment to be net-zero carbon in its operations by 2040. Some of that coin will go towards automation and transportation. Other deals that got our attention …. Self-driving truck startup TuSimple has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to help it raise $250 million, multiple sources told me. Morgan Stanley recently sent potential investors an informational packet, which I also viewed, that provides a snapshot of the company and an overview of its business model, as well as a pitch on why the company is poised to succeed. TuSimple has raised about $298 million with a valuation of more than $1 billion. Its backers include Sina, operator of China’s biggest microblogging site Weibo, Hong Kong-based investment firm Composite Capital, Nvidia, UPS, CDH Investments, Lavender Capital and Tier 1 supplier Mando Corporation. ADAM CogTech, an Israeli automotive software startup, raised $2 million from Mobilion Ventures, the company said. Mobilion is an early-stage fund that invests in smart mobility, focusing on Israeli and global after-market innovation. Amazon’s $575 million investment into UK food delivery startup Deliveroo has been cleared by the country’s competition regulator. The investment, which was announced more than a year ago, gave Amazon a 16% stake in Deliveroo. Now that CMA has provisionally cleared the deal, it is open for public comments until July 10. A final decision is expected August 6. Cazoo, the British online used car marketplace, raised £25 million at a valuation in excess of $1 billion. Draper Esprit joined existing investors in the round, a group that includes DMG Ventures and General Catalyst. Cazoo has raised more than £200 million to date. DriveU.auto, an Israeli startup that spun out of video transmission technology company LiveU, came out of stealth with $4 million in new funding. The startup has developed a connectivity platform for teleoperations. The funding round was led by RAD group co-founder Zohar Zisapel and included participation from Two Lanterns Venture Partners, Yigal Jacoby, Kaedan Capital and other private investors. Francisco Partners is an existing shareholder. Lucid Motors gave up majority ownership to Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund in exchange for the $1.3 billion investment it closed last year, according to information disclosed in a new lawsuit, the Verge reported. Wired Middle East previously reported the PIF had taken a 67% stake. However, this is the first time an acknowledgment from the company has been made public. Shift Technologies, an online used car marketplace, is in talks to merge with blank-check company Insurance Acquisition Corp., Bloomberg reported. Shift is aiming to be valued at more than $500 million in the deal. Third Wave Automation, a startup developing autonomous forklift technology, emerged from stealth with $15 million in equity financing, VentureBeat reported. Volkswagen is in talks to buy Europcar Mobility Group, the French car rental company that has a market capitalization of 390 million euros ($441 million) and net debt as of more than 1 billion euros, Reuters reported. Trucks have popped up a lot this week, so I figured, heck let’s dig in a bit. The big trendy discussion is about how robotaxis are OUT and autonomous Class 8 trucks are IN. This move towards trucking has actually been happening for awhile now. The niche subcategory in the autonomous vehicle industry was rather empty in 2015 when TuSimple was founded. Then self-driving truck startup Otto came along. Uber’s 2016 acquisition of Otto certainly brought some attention to the sector. But a number of other startups had also thrown their respective hats into the trucking ring, including Embark and the now defunct Starsky Robotics. Today, this sub-industry includes Ike, Kodiak Robotics and Waymo. This week, Amazon-backed Aurora received some press for its “shift” to trucking based off of an interview with co-founder Sterling Anderson during The Information’s Autonomous Vehicle Summit. Let’s be clear, the company has been publicly talking about trucks since at least October 2019. The notable bit is that Anderson shared more about its work with trucks and was clearly bullish on the potential in the marketplace. Together, his comments suggest that the company is prioritizing the development of autonomous trucks over cars. But the company designed a full self-driving stack meant to have a variety of applications, not just passenger cars. In a tweet after the interview, Anderson summarized its whole approach. We’re compelled by a product path that goes from middle mile to last mile to mobility services. If you can swing this technically, it allows for an elegant transition from the largest market (today) with the best unit economics and lowest level of service requirements to smaller, but rapidly growing markets with more challenging unit economics and level of service needs” The California Air Resources Board adopted a new rule to phase out the most polluting vehicles on the road today. The rule will require truck manufacturers to transition from diesel trucks and vans to electric zero-emission trucks beginning in 2024. By 2045, every new truck sold in California will be zero-emission. Russian-Finnish company Zyfra is using 5G technology to replace Wi-Fi/mesh networks used for autonomous mining dump trucks, CNET’s Roadshow reports. AVs, ride-hailing, electric vehicles and more! Didi Chuxing said Saturday (today) that its on-demand robotaxi service will start picking up riders in Shanghai, China. Passengers may start requesting on-demand rides for free on autonomous vehicles within a designated open-traffic area that covers Shanghai’s Automobile Exhibition Center, the local business districts, subway stations and hotels in downtown Shanghai, the company said in a press release. Lyft is using data collected from drivers on its ride-hailing app to accelerate the development of self-driving cars. Lyft’s Level 5 self-driving car program is using the data to build 3D maps, understand human driving patterns and improve simulation tests. The program is taking data from select vehicles in its Express Drive program, which provides rental cars and SUVs to drivers on its platform as an alternative to options like long-term leasing Waymo and Volvo Car Group announced Thursday an “exclusive” partnership to integrate Waymo’s self-driving software into a new electric vehicle designed for ride-hailing. Not a ton of detail about the deal or what “exclusive” means. We know that Volvo and Uber still have a partnership. The deal with Waymo involves integrating its self-driving stack into an “all-new mobility-focused electric vehicle platform for ride hailing services.” The partnership also includes other subsidiaries under Volvo Car Group, including electric performance brand Polestar and Lynk & Co. International, a point that Volvo Car Group CTO Henrik Green specifically noted in his prepared statement. Mercedes-Benz and Nvidia announced a partnership to bring “software-defined” vehicles to market. The automaker’s next-generation vehicles will have a software-centric computing architecture based on Nvidia’s Drive AGX Orin computer system-on-a-chip. The underlying architecture will be standard in Mercedes vehicles, starting sometime toward the end of 2024. Apple has added a routing feature to Maps that’s designed for electric vehicle owners. The EV routing feature, which will be available in the newest version of iOS, will show charging stations compatible to a user’s electric vehicle along their route. TechCrunch’s Romain Dillet got a bit more information on this feature. He tells me that users will be able to enter their car model in the app, which will provide stops. The user can tap on the stops to see if the charging station is free or not. On sidenote, Apple is also releasing a feature that will prompt you to raise your phone and scan buildings across the street to refine your location. This feature is based on Look Around, a Google Street View-inspired feature that lets you look around as if you were walking down the street. Arrival revealed a zero-emission bus, the next step in the company to become a major electric transportation company, the Verge reported. Ars Technica digs into one Ohio city’s plan to get more people to buy electric cars. Hint: it worked. Lordstown Motors unveiled an electric pickup truck prototype with four in-wheel hub motors and a few other features all aimed squarely at attracting contractors and other buyers in the commercial market. The Ohio startup didn’t get too deep into the details about the electric pickup truck known as Endurance. But we know a few more bits such as a $52,500 base price and some partnerships. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter that September 15 is the “tentative date” for the “Tesla Shareholder Meeting & Battery Day,” which will include the usual shareholder meeting as well as a tour of the automaker’s cell production system for the batteries that provide the power for its vehicles. Speaking of Tesla … the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened a preliminary investigation into allegations of failing touchscreens on Tesla’s older Model S vehicles. Lyft has agreed to settle a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice that alleges the ridesharing company discriminated against disabled people — specifically those who use foldable wheelchairs or walkers. Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs plans to spin out some of its smart city ideas into separate companies focused on mass timber construction, affordable electrification and planning tools optimized with machine learning and computation design, CEO Daniel Doctoroff said at Collision from Home conference, VentureBeat reported. Ford’s Michigan Central is collaborating with Brooklyn-based Newlab to launch two “Innovation Studios” focused on solving complex transportation industry problems related to connectivity, autonomy and electrification. A corporate studio sponsored by Ford will kick off this summer to address macro mobility issues. A second civic studio will follow focusing on more immediate mobility issues in the neighborhoods around Michigan Central Station. In 2018, Ford acquired 1.2 million square feet in Corktown, Detroit’s oldest neighborhood, including the historic Michigan Central Station, with plans to establish a new mobility innovation district called Michigan Central. The first work spaces are expected to open within Michigan Central in 2022. GM turned to 3D printing for a C8 Corvette prototype. In the end, 75% of the vehicle was 3D printed, Car and Driver reported. Bring a +1 and save 60%Have a +1 you’d like to bring to Disrupt? Bring them along and save 60% on their pass.

    "content": "There is “reasonable evidence” to conclude that Tesla and its officers, including CEO Elon Musk, knew its vehicles had defective Autopilot systems but still allowed the cars to be driven in areas “not safe for that technology,” a Florida judge found. The ruling last week from Judge Reid Scott, in the Circuit Court for Palm Beach County, means the family of a man who died in a collision while his Tesla’s Autopilot was engaged can go to trial and seek punitive damages from Tesla for intentional misconduct and gross negligence. Reuters first reported the news. The hit to Tesla comes after the electric vehicle maker won two product liability cases in California earlier this year over the safety of its Autopilot system. Autopilot is Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system that can perform automated driving tasks like navigating on and off highway ramps, cruise control, lane changes and automatic parking. The Florida lawsuit was the result of a 2019 crash north of Miami. Owner Stephen Banner’s Model 3 drove under the trailer of an 18-wheeler that had turned onto the road, cutting off the Tesla’s roof and killing Banner. A trial that was set for October has been delayed and has yet to be rescheduled. When the case goes to trial, it might reveal new information about the reams of data Tesla collects, information that is usually top secret. Judge Scott’s finding that managers at Tesla’s top knew of the defects could also mean Musk would have to testify. The judge said that Tesla’s marketing strategy painted the products as autonomous and Musk’s public statements about Autopilot “had a significant effect on the belief about the capabilities of the products,” according to the ruling. The judge pointed to a misleading 2016 video, which Musk was found to have overseen, that purported to show a Tesla being driven completely autonomously by the Autopilot system. The billionaire entrepreneur was not required to sit for a deposition after a judge rejected the Banners’ argument that Musk had “unique knowledge” of the issues of the case. The judge compared Banner’s crash to a similar 2016 fatal crash involving Joshua Brown in which Autopilot failed to detect crossing trucks, which led to the vehicle crashing into the side of a tractor trailer at high speed. The judge also based his finding on testimony given by Autopilot engineer Adam Gustafsson and Dr. Mary “Missy” Cummings, director of the Autonomy and Robotics Center at George Mason University. Gustafsson, who was the investigator on both Banner’s and Brown’s crashes, testified that Autopilot in both cases failed to detect the semitrailer and stop the vehicle. The engineer further testified that despite Tesla being aware of the problem, no changes were made to the cross-traffic detection warning system from the date of Brown’s crash until Banner’s crash to account for cross traffic. The judge wrote in his ruling that the testimony of other Tesla engineers leads to the reasonable conclusion that Musk, who was “intimately involved” in the development of Autopilot, was “acutely aware” of the problem and failed to remedy it. A Tesla spokesperson could not be reached to comment. As Tesla has done in the past, the automaker will likely argue that Banner’s crash was the result of human error. A National Transportation Safety Board probe into the accident found that there was blame to go around — according to the investigation, the truck driver had failed to yield right of way and Banner was inattentive due to over-reliance on Autopilot. But the NTSB also found that Autopilot didn’t send a visual or audible warning to the driver to put his hands back on the wheel, according to Bloomberg. Tesla’s lawyers may rely on the precedent set in two previous cases this year, from which the automaker emerged victorious. In April, Tesla secured a win after a California jury determined the automaker was not to blame for a 2019 crash involving Autopilot. Plaintiff Justine Hsu sued Tesla in 2020 for fraud, negligence and breach of contract, but was awarded no damages. A few weeks ago, a jury sided with Tesla over allegations that Autopilot led to the death of Tesla driver Micah Lee in 2019. The two plaintiffs, survivors of the crash, alleged that Tesla knew its product was defective and sought $400 million in damages. Tesla argued that the crash was the result of human error. The case — No. 50-2019-CA-009962 — is being tried in the Circuit Court for Palm Beach County, Florida.

    "content": "The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox. Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B. Amid the deal-making and partnership news this week, one item raised both of my eyebrows. Although I must admit, I wasn’t exactly surprised. I’m talking about the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and its plans to develop a new rating program that will evaluate the safeguards that vehicles with “partial automation” use to help drivers stay focused on the road. IIHS, a nonprofit that is funded by auto insurance companies, will give systems good, acceptable, marginal or poor ratings. The first set of ratings is expected to be issued in 2022, IIHS said, though it did not give a specific date because ongoing supply chain issues have made it more difficult to obtain vehicles for testing. The organization’s takeaway? Not a single advanced driver assistance system offered in today’s new vehicles would meet its pending safety criteria. You can read my full coverage of this here; but for those who don’t click that link, here are two important items to consider: Side note: Consumer Reports’ 2022 autos Top Picks, which will be announced on February 17, will include evaluations of driver monitoring systems. CR will add two points to a vehicle’s overall score if it features a system that encourages safe driving as part of the model’s active driving assistance package. One final (maybe fun?) item. I went back and looked at my predictions for 2021. They’re all here in The Station edition from January 11, 2021 (this is the second part, but I also recap the first part at the bottom). Check it out, and give me a grade. ;D As always, you can email me at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com to share thoughts, criticisms, opinions or tips. You also can send a direct message to me at Twitter — @kirstenkorosec. Let’s talk a little about how cities are embracing micromobility, and how they can improve. Transport for London recently released stats that showed the share of journeys made in the city by cycling or walking has increased from 27% to 42% during the pandemic. Even more promising is the National Bicycle Dealers Association’s Bicycling Buying 2021 Consumer Research study, which found 56% of female bicyclists who are riding today either started cycling or returned to it during the pandemic. All great signs that the momentum is here, but cities need to step up their infrastructure game. A survey from Victoria, Australia found that 75% of respondents are interested in biking, but are concerned about lack of safety infrastructure. The Aussies are no doubt not the only ones. But it doesn’t only come down to infrastructure. Cities also need to be working with micromobility companies to ensure easy and affordable access to bikes and scooters. Look at Prague as an example. The city recently decided to make free 15-minute bikeshare rides a permanent part of its public transport offer. New York City is also working with Brooklyn-based bike and scooter subscription service Beyond to study how micromobility can be integrated with public transit. (NYC is also working with Lyft to offer free 60-day Citibike memberships to public and private hospital workers who are battling rising COVID-19 Omicron cases.) Speaking of which, yet another micromobility startup, Helbiz, is integrating with Google Maps worldwide, which will no doubt help micromobility become more a part of the broader transit ecosystem. Meanwhile, Stockholm is actually reducing the number of shared e-scooters in the city by 50% because of the apparent chaos of 23,000 scooters roaming around. The city will allow all eight of its current micromobility providers to continue operating a reduced service. While I initially wince at the thought of cutting back greener forms of transit, public opinion is important for long-term adoption. A recent survey of Stockholmers found 57% were negative about e-scooters, versus 50% last year. HumanForest is partnering with Deliveroo to give London delivery workers access to shared e-bikes. The company also just ran the first of what will be multiple challenges to encourage sustainable riding among its customers. The first, called the “CO2 Saver” took place from January 17 to 23, and involves riders monitoring the amount of CO2 they saved from being emitted, the hours they spent outside and the amount of energy they burned through cycling. The winners are rewarded with TreeCoins, or points that can be used toward rides. Gogoro is doing a second vehicle collab with Yamaha to produce the Yamaha EMF, which is built from the ground up to utilize Gogoro’s battery swapping platform. The EMF will be available in Taiwan in March. Bird published a blog post that dug into its battery management system, which runs real-time diagnostics and sets dynamic power limits on the operator’s IP68-rated battery cell packs for e-scooters, while communicating directly with the e-scooters’ CAN bus. Bird’s BMS allows the company to monitor and take action on any safety or sustainability issues like battery failures. OK, so this isn’t a traditional company X raises $$$ type of deal, but this week we’re mixing it up. I find this item notable because it illustrates increasing interest from traditional automakers to use lidar in passenger vehicles. The gist: Mercedes-Benz agreed to use Luminar’s lidar technology in future vehicles as part of a broader deal that includes data sharing and the automaker taking a small stake in the company. Mercedes-Benz will acquire up to 1.5 million Luminar shares, in exchange for certain data and services. The companies declined to share information about when Luminar lidar would be integrated into Mercedes-Benz vehicles. I went back and listened to an interview I had with Markus Schäfer, Daimler AG board member and Mercedes-Benz AG’s CTO responsible for development and procurement. We were talking about the EQXX Vision, a halo car of sorts that was revealed earlier this month ahead of the CES tech trade show. The vehicle, which went from idea to prototype in 18 months, is meant be the foundation for its future electric vehicles and it featured all sorts of technological innovations with the battery and drivetrain, as well as other items that Schäfer said will be in Mercedes-Benz electric vehicles beginning in 2024. Perhaps Luminar’s lidar will also show up in 2024 model year Mercedes vehicles. Other deals that got my attention … Factorial Energy raised $200 million as part of a Series D round of funding that was led by automakers Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis. The company said the funding will be used to accelerate commercial production and deployment of its solid-state battery technology. Gogoro, the Taiwanese company best known for its electric smartscooters and swappable battery infrastructure, has just added to its PIPE investment current strategic partner Hero MotoCorp, activist and impact investment firm Engine No. 1 and another investor, bringing the total funding to $285 million, up from $257 million. The company still intends to complete its SPAC deal with Poema Global by the end of this quarter. Monta, the electric vehicle charging platform, closed a $15 million Series A funding round led by Creandum, an early-stage venture capital firm based in Stockholm. The company said that Headline also made a significant investment. Parallel Systems, a company founded by three former SpaceX engineers to build autonomous battery-electric rail vehicles, came out of stealth mode with a $49.55 million Series A raise. The company, which has raised $53.15 million to date, including a $3.6 million seed round, is working to create a more efficient, decarbonized freight network that flows on top of existing railway infrastructure. Phantom Auto, a startup that has developed remote operation software for vehicles, received a strategic investment of $42 million led by freight and logistics service provider ArcBest and NFI. As part of the deal, ArcBest and NFI reached a commercial agreement to deploy thousands of Phantom-powered forklifts in the coming years. The funding also includes investment from Bessemer Venture Partners, Maniv Mobility, Perot Jain and other previous investors. Phantom Auto initially focused on the autonomous vehicle industry, but pivoted to logistics vehicles like forklifts. Last March, global logistics company Geodis tapped Phantom Auto to help it deploy remotely operated forklifts at two sites and eventually expand to other warehouses. Mitsubishi Electric, the automaker’s electronics equipment manufacturing company, is starting a pilot program to explore the value of autonomous robots. The company will be working with Cartken, the Google alum startup that came out of stealth last March, to unleash a small number of Cartken’s delivery robots in a Japanese mall to provide indoor and curb-side food delivery services, initially for Starbucks customers. Blink Charging, the electric vehicle charger manufacturer, will deploy EV chargers at General Motors dealerships across the U.S. and Canada. The startup will be teaming up with facility solutions provider ABM to supply its new IQ 200 Level 2 chargers to GM. Blink said it has around 30,000 EV chargers set up across 13 countries; this deal might help Blink gain more brand recognition and compete with companies with larger market share. Electrek rounds up every EV that still qualifies for the U.S. federal tax credit. Scott Painter, who founded auto pricing company TrueCar Inc. and car subscription service Fair, has a new thing going. Painter launched a company in 2020 called NextCar that was supposed to be a B2B type business that sold a software-as-a-service platform to vehicle subscription providers. NextCar Holdings remains, but under it a new company called “Autonomy” has been born. Autonomy will be a consumer-facing business that lets customers rent a Tesla Model 3 for a flat monthly fee. Painter told Automotive News that it is “not a traditional lease or car loan.” Volkswagen is bringing back the e-Up minicar, according to German news site Golem. Ford signed a five-year agreement with online payment processor Stripe to scale the automaker’s e-commerce capabilities. Stripe will facilitate transactions for vehicle orders and reservations, handle financing options for Ford’s commercial customers and route customer’s payments from the automaker’s website to the correct local Ford or Lincoln dealer. Ford said it plans to begin rolling out Stripe’s technology in the second half of 2022, starting with North America. General Motors plans to expand its hydrogen fuel cell business and apply the technology to other commercial applications beyond vehicles, including power generators used for the military and EV chargers. GM’s branded Hydrotec fuel cell technology is currently in development for use in heavy-duty trucks, aerospace and locomotives. Hyundai is partnering with quantum computer maker IonQ to develop new variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithms. Why? The plan is to use these quantum algoritums to study lithium compounds and their chemical reactions involved in battery chemistry. The aim is to develop batteries that are cheaper, safer and have better performance. Tesla shareholders urged a judge to find that CEO Elon Musk coerced the company’s board to acquire SolarCity in 2016, a transaction that a group of shareholders allege was a “bailout” of the failing solar company of which Musk was the top shareholder. During a Zoom hearing on Tuesday, the shareholders asked that Musk be ordered to return the stock he received from the deal and pay Tesla $13 billion. Volkswagen and Bosch have signed a memorandum of understanding to explore a joint venture dedicated to providing Europe with battery equipment solutions. The two companies aim to supply integrated battery production systems and on-site ramp-up and maintenance support for battery cell and system manufacturers. The JV is expected to help VW reach its goal to build six cell factories by 2030, but it will also be available to serve other factories across Europe.

    "content": "SpaceX has a big launch coming up this morning from Cape Canaveral in Florida — a Falcon 9 will carry a payload of 60 of its Starlink orbital communications satellites to space at 9:56 AM ET (6:56 AM PT). The Starlink satellites are the first non-test group of SpaceX’s new constellation heading up en masse, with the aim of helping set up a network that will eventually provide global high-speed internet connectivity. SpaceX has already sent up 62 Starlink satellites in total, across two test batch launches: Two launched in February 2018 from Vandenberg in California, aboard a rocket that was also transporting a satellite called “Paz” for a client, and 60 launched in May of this year, a large test batch that was used to trial ground-based communications, as well as controlled de-orbiting mechanisms. Of those 60, 57 satellites are still in orbit while three became non-operational after launch. This mission will set up this new batch of 60 Starlink satellites in orbit, which feature increased spectrum capacity and construction that features 100% “demisability,” which means that at the end of their operating life they’ll burn up completely upon controlled re-entry to ensure there’s nothing left behind once they’re no longer in use. This is one of six launches of Starlink satellites that SpaceX says will lead up to the launch of its service across the U.S. and Canada, and one of 24 launches that will enable global high-bandwidth broadband service. Besides setting up the foundation for its global satellite internet network, this launch is noteworthy from the perspective of SpaceX’s focus on re-usability. The first stage for the Falcon 9 used here previously flew on three separate missions, a record for a Falcon 9 booster in terms of re-use, and the fairing used to protect the payload also flew before on the Falcon Heavy Arabsat-6A mission launched earlier this year. SpaceX plans to land the booster again, and it will attempt to recover the fairing once again, using its sea-borne catcher vessels in the Atlantic. The launch window at 9:56 AM ET is instantaneous, and SpaceX should begin broadcasting the live stream above about 15 minutes prior to that.

    "content": "SpaceX has successfully launched its Iridium-5 mission, which carries 10 satellites to add to Iridium’s NEXT global communications constellation. This is the fifth set of 10, out of a total of 75 that SpaceX is launching for client Iridium, and today’s launch used a first stage Falcon 9 booster originally employed last October for the third Iridium NEXT satellite launch. The launch included reuse of a flight proven rocket, but it did not include a recovery attempt for the first stage booster this time around. SpaceX attempted to recover one half of the fairing used during the launch, which is the protective metal shielding that covers the cargo as the rocket blasts through the atmosphere en route to space. The fairing alone is worth around $6 million, and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has indicated that it would be relatively easy to refurbish this part for repeat flight, provided their recovery plan works. SpaceX was once again unsuccessful in recovering the fairing, per Musk. The parafoil that controls the fairing’s descent twisted during its return to Earth, and so the component crashed into the water a high velocity instead of alighting softly on the barge as intended. Meanwhile, the 10 satellites were deployed as planned to their target low-Earth orbit, and will join the NEXT constellation, providing commercial communications capabilities to Iridium clients on the ground. This is SpaceX’s fifth Falcon 9 launch of 2018, and its sixth launch of the year overall when you include the Falcon Heavy launch which took place in February. That was a significant milestone for the company, and additional Falcon Heavy launches are planned for later this year, as well as another Falcon 9 launch on April 2: The twelfth commercial resupply mission SpaceX will fly for the International Space Station.

    "content": "SpaceX’s futuristic Starship interplanetary craft may embody the golden age of sci-fi in more ways than one: in addition to (theoretically) taking passengers from planet to planet, it may sport a shiny stainless steel skin that makes it look like the pulp covers of old. Founder and CEO Elon Musk teased the possibility in a picture posted to Twitter, captioned simply “Stainless Steel Starship.” To be clear, this isn’t a full-on spacecraft, just part of a test vehicle that the company plans to use during the short “hopper” flights in 2019 to evaluate various systems. As with most Musk tweets, this kicked off a storm of speculation and argument in the Twitterverse. The choice surprised many because for years, modern spaceflight has been dependent on advanced composite materials like carbon fiber, which combine desirable physical properties with low weight. When metal has been required, aluminum or titanium are much more common. While some launch components, like the upper stage of the Atlas 5 rocket, have liberally used steel, it’s definitely not an obvious choice for a craft like the Starship, which will have to deal with both deep space and repeated reentry. As Musk pointed out in subsequent comments, however, stainless steel has some advantages versus other materials when at extremely hot or cold temperatures. Usable strength/weight of full hard stainless at cryo is slightly better than carbon fiber, room temp is worse, high temp is vastly better — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 24, 2018 This is a special full-hardness steel alloy mentioned as being among the 300 series of high-strength, heat-resistant alloys — not the plentiful, pliable stuff we all have in our kitchens and buildings. Musk also mentioned another “superalloy” called SX500 that SpaceX’s metallurgists have developed for use in the Raptor engines that will power the vehicle. 18 new details about Elon Musk’s redesigned, moon-bound ‘Big F*ing Rocket’ So why stainless? It’s likely all about reentry. Many craft and reusable stages that have to face the heat of entering the atmosphere at high speed use “ablative” heat shielding that disintegrates or breaks away in a controlled fashion, carrying heat away from the vehicle. It’s unlikely this is a possibility for Starship, however, as replacing and repairing this material would necessitate downtime and crews wherever and whenever it lands, and the craft is meant to be (eventually) a quick-turnaround ship with maximum reusability. Heat shielding that reflects and survives is a better bet for that — but an enormous engineering problem. Scott Manley put together a nice video illustrating some of these ideas and speculations in detail: Musk said before of the Starship (then still called BFR) that “almost the entire time it is reentering, it’s just trying to brake, while distributing that force over the most area possible.” Reentry will probably look more like a Space Shuttle-esque glide than a Falcon 9 first stage’s ballistic descent and engine braking. The switch to stainless steel has the pleasant side effect of making the craft look really cool — more in line with sci-fi books and comics than their readers perhaps ever thought to hope. Paint jobs would burn right off, Musk said: Skin will get too hot for paint. Stainless mirror finish. Maximum relfectivity. You can’t expect it to stay shiny for long, though; it may be stainless, but like a pan you left on the stove, stainless steel can still scorch, and the bottom of the Starship will likely look pretty rough after a while. It’s all right — spacecraft developing a patina is a charming evolution. Details are still few, and for all we know SpaceX could redesign the craft again based on how tests go. Next year will see the earliest hopper flights for Starship hardware and possibly the Super Heavy lower stage that will lift its great shiny bulk out of the lower atmosphere. The technical documentation promised by Musk should arrive in March or April, but whether it will pertain solely to the test vehicle or give a glimpse at the craft SpaceX intends to send around the moon is anyone’s guess. At any rate you should expect more information to be spontaneously revealed before then at Musk’s discretion — or lack thereof. Devin Coldewey is a Seattle-based writer and photographer.

    "content": "SpaceX plans to lay off approximately 10 percent of its workforce in order to manage its costs, the company confirmed to TechCrunch today. The news comes as the company embarks on an ambitious plan to develop and test an interplanetary spacecraft while simultaneously performing frequent orbital launches. In a statement provided to TechCrunch, SpaceX explained that the layoffs are in pursuit of becoming a “leaner company” and that they were only necessary due to “the extraordinarily difficult challenges ahead.” To continue delivering for our customers and to succeed in developing interplanetary spacecraft and a global space-based Internet, SpaceX must become a leaner company. Either of these developments, even when attempted separately, have bankrupted other organizations. This means we must part ways with some talented and hardworking members of our team. We are grateful for everything they have accomplished and their commitment to SpaceX’s mission. This action is taken only due to the extraordinarily difficult challenges ahead and would not otherwise be necessary. The company employed at least 7,000 people in late 2017 when COO Gwynne Shotwell last gave a number — which means around 700 will lose their jobs. I asked SpaceX for more information on where these jobs might come from — engineering, manufacturing, sales, certain projects, etc — but apart from the statement the company did not offer any answers. Layoffs of this scale ring alarm bells pretty much across the board, but the company has insisted that it is solvent and successful. And indeed even if it were not, it is hard to imagine that its extremely successful and increasingly reliable Falcon 9 launch vehicle would cease operations any time soon. In fact one might expect launch numbers to increase with financial difficulties in order to increase revenue. 18 new details about Elon Musk’s redesigned, moon-bound ‘Big F*ing Rocket’ Why such a major reduction in workforce, and why now? The company’s excuse of wanting to be lean doesn’t explain much; SpaceX can hardly have any fat to trim off it considering how young and small it is compared with other aerospace concerns, as well as the breadth of its services and research. It seems unlikely that there are hundreds of middle managers loafing their way to a paycheck. It’s far more likely SpaceX barely has enough employees to do what it already does. But mounting costs may simply have caught up with SpaceX’s ambitions; it has, after all, been forging forward on multiple fronts, any single one of which would be more than enough for a single company. It has been building and actively improving its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles for years, with the former now more or less in a final state but the latter far from it. It has been researching and prototyping an interplanetary spacecraft, formerly known as the BFR and now Starship. It is building and testing a crewed capsule intended to bring astronauts to the International Space Station. And it is planning a 400-strong constellation of satellites to deliver high speed internet connectivity at a global scale. SpaceX said to be raising $500M to help fund internet service So it is perhaps understandable that despite raising $450 million in 2017 and having another round of a similar size rumored to be in negotiation right now, the money is pouring out just about as fast as investors can pour it in. Hundreds of millions in contracts help as well, but they bring costs and responsibilities with them. Its many projects hold the promise of riches, but require years of incubation and investment. The most logical place to cut from would perhaps be the Falcon 9 development team; CEO Elon Musk indicated that large scale R&D on the platform was ending and being reallocated to the Falcon Heavy and Starship projects. Therefore there may well be designers and engineers who are more easy to part with than others. But that is merely speculation. All this is just to say that SpaceX’s financials and operations are too complicated to write off major layoffs as simply due to revenue shortfalls or overzealous hiring. I have asked SpaceX for more details and will update this post if I hear back; in the meantime we are very likely to hear more from the company, or the talkative Musk, in the next few days.

    "content": "SpaceX beat out one other competitor to land a $130 million launch contract with the U.S. Air Force using its Falcon Heavy rocket. The award is an important validation of the Falcon Heavy, one of the most powerful rockets ever made. Under the contract, the Hawthorne, Calif.-based rocket company founded by Elon Musk will launch the Air Force Space Command-52 satellite to its intended orbit. The contract includes launch vehicle production and mission, as well as integration, launch operations and spaceflight worthiness activities, according to a notice posted by the U.S. Department of Defense. The work, which will be performed at SpaceX’s headquarters, the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and in McGregor, Texas, is expected to be completed by September 2020. The mission is planned to be launched from Kennedy Space Center. Two proposals were received by the DOD in the competitive bidding process. “SpaceX is honored by the Air Force’s selection of Falcon Heavy to launch the competitively-awarded AFSPC-52 mission,” said SpaceX President and COO Gwynne Shotwell. “On behalf of all of our employees, I want to thank the Air Force for certifying Falcon Heavy, awarding us this critically important mission, and for their trust and confidence in our company. SpaceX is pleased to continue offering the American taxpayer the most cost-effective, reliable launch services for vital national security space missions.” SpaceX successfully launched the Falcon Heavy for the first time (with a Tesla Roadster strapped to the top, no less, because… well, Elon.) in February 2018. The rocket has three cores, or first-stage boosters, that work in unison to get the rocket into a low Earth orbit. There are two side boosters and a center core. SpaceX has designed the rocket so that after stage separation all three boosters will land and be able to be reused. The company recovered two of the three boosters.

    "content": "Consumer interest in open source, decentralized social networking isn’t something that was only reflected in news headlines over the past year, it’s also apparent in the financials behind Mastodon. The nonprofit organization powers one of the many apps that came into fashion as a Twitter alternative following Elon Musk’s acquisition of the social network he’s since renamed X. According to Mastodon’s annual report, released today, the company says it’s seen a 488% increase in donations, totaling €325.9K, or roughly $341,985 in U.S. dollars. That’s up from just €55.6K in its fiscal year 2021, though still a much smaller amount compared with the funds pouring into other would-be Twitter rivals like Bluesky, Pebble or Spill. Bluesky, for instance, announced a seed round of $8 million this June, while Pebble (formerly T2) raised over a million from angel investors, and Spill raised a $2.75 million pre-seed round. But unlike investor-backed startups, Mastodon operates as a nonprofit supported by user donations, primarily from Patreon. That supporter base also grew last year to 9,603, up 1,614% from the 560 donors it had at year-end 2021. From its own custom sponsorship portal, it also has an additional 53 subscriptions, up from 20 last year. What’s telling is that the biggest jumps in Mastodon support came immediately following Elon Musk’s Twitter acquisition, which closed in October. As Mastodon’s report notes, the number of donors on Patreon grew from 1,428 in September to 7,962 in October — that’s a 6x increase. And the number of donors via Stripe increased from 19 to 44. But this, in turn, meant the average annual donation decreased to roughly $35.70 USD, due to an increase in the number of donors who contributed smaller amounts. The funds were used to support the operating costs of running Mastodon (€127.1K / $133.5K USD), personnel expenses (€79.7K / $83.7K USD) and other miscellaneous expenses (€6.4K / $6.72K USD), the report says. In addition, Mastodon founder Eugen Rochko benefitted from an open source fund financed by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the German Open Knowledge Foundation, which contributed €18.6K ($19.5K USD). NLnet, a nonprofit foundation that supports open source development of internet technologies, also contributed €42.8K ($44.95K USD). The full report also goes into detail about Mastodon’s development over the course of the year, which included a branding update with more vibrant shades of purple, and other web and mobile software updates, redesigns, improvements to its moderation system and support, and more. Over the course of 2022, the two servers Mastodon itself operates — Mastodon.social and Mastodon.online — gained 486,000 new users and processed 15,237 moderation reports; 5,920 of those resulted in the suspension of an account. And, in total, 66,637 accounts were suspended this past year. Given Mastodon’s growth, the company aims to set up a U.S. nonprofit branch (501(c)(3)) this year with a board of governors so it can become eligible for larger grants from U.S.-based donors and allow donors to make their donations tax-deductible. It’s also planning further merchandise efforts, which began with the sales of stickers, tees, mugs and pins earlier this year. The report didn’t break out how much revenue those merch sales produced, however. Mastodon is launching merch to help fund its development efforts In addition, the company will continue to work to make Mastodon more user-friendly, the report says. The company recently made good on those efforts with the release of version 4.2, which was a significant update designed to make the service easier to use — particularly for newcomers. Mastodon also plans to improve moderation tooling for server operators to address spam and abuse issues. That issue had come to light this year, as well, as Mastodon’s software — which anyone can run on their own servers — was found to be hosting child sexual abuse material (CSAM). In one case, the server operator explained that they could only manage moderation in their spare time — and they were only one person, not a team as you’d have at Meta — so removals could take days. As for Mastodon’s growth — which speaks to its potential impact on X as former users flee the platform looking for alternatives — the network grew from 2,527 servers, totaling 2.7 million registered and 294,000 monthly active users at the end of 2021 to 9,686 servers, totaling 5.8 million registered users and 1.8 million monthly active users. On its own two servers, Mastodon had 117,000 active accounts by year-end, representing a roughly 37% retention rate. Of course, as we’ve seen, Mastodon’s user metrics wax and wane at times with Musk’s pronouncements about new X policies and changes. For example, TechCrunch noted that as X underwent its rebranding, Mastodon’s monthly active users had reached 2.1 million, only slightly short of last year’s peak of 2.5 million when Musk bought the social network. Currently, the network reports 1.7 million monthly active users.

    "content": "X, formerly Twitter, today announced support for passkeys, a new and more secure login method than traditional passwords, which will become an option for U.S. users on iOS devices. The technology has been adopted by a number of apps as of late, including PayPal, TikTok, WhatsApp, and others. Today we’re excited to launch Passkeys as a login option for our US-based users on iOS! A passkey is a new, easy to use, and secure way to log in to your account – all from your device. Passkeys are more secure than traditional passwords since they’re individually generated by… — Safety (@Safety) January 23, 2024 Initiated by Google, Apple, Microsoft, and the FIDO Alliance, alongside the World Wide Web Consortium, passkey technology aims to make passwordless logins available across different devices, operating systems, and web browsers. The feature arrived on iOS devices in September 2022 and on Google accounts last May. Unlike logins which rely only on a username and password combination, passkeys use a biometric authentication like Face ID or Touch ID, a PIN, or a physical security authentication key to validate login attempts. This process combines the benefits of two-factor authentication (2FA) into a single step, to make the login process more seamless while also being more secure. The addition is a particularly useful one for X, given the high-profile hacks that have seen accounts on the service compromised by bad actors. For instance, this January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange’s X account was hacked to share an unauthorized post regarding Bitcoin ETF approval. Other notable hacks have included Donald Trump Jr.’s X account, which was used to post a fake message saying that Donald Trump had passed away, as well as a widespread 2020 crypto scam that saw large accounts compromised, including Apple’s, President Biden’s, and even X owner Elon Musk’s account, among others. In that case, the accounts were used to post a message promoting the address of a Bitcoin wallet with the promise of doubling payments in return. (This hack was prior to Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, now called X). In the days since Musk’s takeover of Twitter/X, the company removed another security measure that helped keep accounts secure when it announced last year that it would no longer support SMS 2FA for non-paying accounts. Twitter (it was Twitter then, not X!) justified the change, likely a cost-cutting measure, by saying the method could be abused by bad actors, such as in the case of SIM swaps. However, the reality was that removing the security protection made Twitter less secure, as a result. X shared instructions on how to get started with passkeys on iOS but the company didn’t say when the option would be available on other platforms or to more markets beyond the U.S. Bring a +1 and save 60%Have a +1 you’d like to bring to Disrupt?

Before its rebranding as X and Musk’s acquisition, Twitter had been exploring e-commerce initiatives, including the 2022 launch of mobile storefronts for merchants, then known as Twitter Shops, as well as features that allowed merchants to tease their upcoming product drops and send reminders to customers. And shortly after Musk took ownership of X, the company announced a more significant move with its first test of its livestream shopping platform. Walmart was the debut partner to test out this initiative, where it kicked off a Cyber Deals live event on Twitter in November 2022, where users were able to watch a live broadcast, shop the featured products and join the conversation around the event by tweeting. The queen of pop culture, music, business, and TV is #Sliving on X. @ParisHilton welcome to the @X family, we're excited to launch an official partnership with you and your next-gen media company 11:11. Together we're going to create a launchpad for new initiatives in video and… pic.twitter.com/7ctohyn3Nb — Linda Yaccarino (@lindayaX) October 2, 2023 The technology infrastructure for livestream shopping had been built in the pre-Musk era of Twitter, but now the emphasis is shifting away from retailers and merchants and more toward creators, it appears. The X partnership is actually with Hilton’s media company 11:11, noted X CEO Linda Yaccarino, who posted on X that the deal will “create a launchpad for new initiatives in video and live video, live commerce, Spaces, and so much more.” After Musk’s takeover of the network, livestream shopping and other Twitter projects sat on the back burner as the team focused on shaking things up at the company by launching paid verification through what used to be known as Twitter Blue, in addition to making other policy changes, including those that targeted creators, which X now aims to better court through higher payouts. However, over the past few days, X has revisited its livestreaming initiatives. On Thursday of last week, Musk took it upon himself to test the platform’s capabilities by livestreaming himself from the U.S.-Mexico border, where he made statements about needing a Trump-style wall and stronger security measures. Unfortunately, the livestream crashed, prompting Musk to email everyone at X with a note to “Please fix this.” Musk also recently tested livestreamed gaming through an alt account. LIVE: Elon is testing X game livestreaming via an alt account. https://t.co/s4QnOE4jfb — X Daily News (@xDaily) October 2, 2023 Given the infrastructure’s failure only days ago, it’s unclear how well it will hold up for a Paris Hilton livestream, given she has 16.6 million followers on X. Of course, that’s far fewer than Elon Musk’s 158.6 million, so the system won’t be under the same amount of stress. The news of the Hilton deal follows statements Musk has made about his plans for X to innovate beyond being only a microblogging site to instead be a place that caters to creators and allows them to monetize their fan bases. To that end, the company opened up an ad revenue-sharing program for creators, which has already paid out nearly $20 million, according to recent statements from X CEO Linda Yaccarino. The company has also been reinvesting in video, having added support for two-hour videos this past spring. X advertiser Apple used the feature to stream an entire episode of its Apple TV+ show “Silo.” Musk also recently touted the viewership of canned Fox News host Tucker Carlson’s show on X, though further analysis indicated Musk inflated the view count. As for e-commerce, it remains unclear whether consumers want to shop on X — or on social media, in general, for that matter. Meta shut down its own live shopping feature on October 1st, after earlier sunsetting the option on Instagram. But in more recent months, TikTok has been expanding its live shopping efforts, including with a U.S. launch just last month. Given X’s new developments, it’s clear the company still believes there’s potential in live shopping. Bring a +1 and save 60%Have a +1 you’d like to bring to Disrupt?

    "content": "Elon Musk has spent decades building a universe of companies that has served as an incubator for up-and-coming engineers and a proving ground for his inner circle. That universe — an ecosystem of Silicon Valley tech titans, veterans of his companies like Tesla and SpaceX, and a crop of fresh-faced hackers and software engineers — has now collided with the U.S. federal government. The dozens of individuals who work under, or advise, Musk and the Trump-ordered Department of Government Efficiency — individuals who TechCrunch has identified or confirmed independently — reflects more than the billionaire’s proclivity to collect talent. They are a real-life illustration of Musk’s web-like reach in the tech industry. TechCrunch set out to report on or confirm the individuals working as Musk representatives in the U.S. government. Importantly, we’ve sought to show the connections between them, and how and when they entered Musk’s orbit. Along the way, TechCrunch has made some new discoveries, including new details about DOGE and its workers and an xAI-powered chatbot on a DOGE-related website subdomain that is hosted on a Musk acolyte’s website. Since publishing, TechCrunch has learned that DOGE cut cybersecurity staff at CISA, and confirmed several more Musk-linked DOGE associates, including a former VC who now works at the Social Security Administration. This article has been updated multiple times since it was published February 18, 2025. TechCrunch interviewed people who have worked with Musk and DOGE staffers. We used public and open source data, such as historical internet records and chat logs, to confirm parts of our reporting. We also relied on services like the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine to access archived copies of websites that are no longer online. Public information, such as court records, payments transactions, other media reports, and past TechCrunch reporting were also used. TechCrunch reached out to all those named for an opportunity to comment. For those whose contact information we did not have, TechCrunch contacted known representatives, including the Trump administration. When reached for comment, a White House spokesperson provided a statement to TechCrunch. (The spokesperson sent the email “on background,” but we are publishing in full as we were given no opportunity to decline the terms.) “DOGE is fulfilling President Trump’s commitment to making government more accountable, efficient, and, most importantly, restoring proper stewardship of the American taxpayer’s hard-earned dollars. Those leading this mission with Elon Musk are doing so in full compliance with federal law, appropriate security clearances, and as employees of the relevant agencies, not as outside advisers or entities. The ongoing operations of DOGE may be seen as disruptive by those entrenched in the federal bureaucracy, who resist change. While change can be uncomfortable, it is necessary and aligns with the mandate supported by more than 77 million American voters,” the statement read. Scroll down to learn about the individuals in the DOGE universe, which have been broken down by type: Musk’s inner circle; senior figures; worker bees; and aides, some of whom are advising and recruiting for DOGE. If you know more about DOGE, contact TechCrunch securely. Role: DOGE Lead, Unpaid “Special Government Employee” Gravitas. Obsession. Ambition. Risk-taker. Elon Musk observers and sycophants have pointed to these traits to explain his rise from a bright-eyed immigrant landing in the United States to one of the world’s richest and most powerful people, and now a right-hand to President Donald Trump. The overlooked secret sauce is Musk’s ability to get talented people to sign on to “the mission.” That there are multiple, overlapping, and evolving missions — saving the planet through sustainable transport and energy, solving traffic, making humanity multiplanetary, or protecting public conversation — doesn’t really matter. The biggest carrot was, and has always been, Musk’s “us versus them” framing, according to five sources who had lengthy stints at Tesla and spoke to TechCrunch on condition of anonymity. In the past, the “them” might be local regulators, the press, or legacy automakers. Today, the people working closely with Musk to complete his next mission via the Department of Government Efficiency have a new “them” to battle: waste and bureaucrats. Musk has talked at length about government agencies that should be “deleted entirely.” Meanwhile, Musk’s companies have benefited from government contracts and incentives. His company SpaceX has been awarded more than $20 billion in contracts from NASA, the Department of Defense, and other federal agencies, according to data from USASpending.gov. Musk is an unpaid special government employee, according to the White House. Per a filing on February 17, the Trump administration said Musk is a White House employee and a senior advisor to the president. According to the Trump administration’s executive order, DOGE is a temporary government organization whose authorities are set to expire in July 2026. In April, Musk made public statements that he was backing away from DOGE to focus on his own companies, namely Tesla. And yet, Musk also said he may keep doing work with the department through the remainder of Trump’s second term. Steve Davis is a long-time Musk confidant. He began working at SpaceX as one of its earliest employees in 2003 after earning a master’s degree in aerospace engineering from Stanford University, according to the Los Angeles Times. By 2016, Musk tapped Davis to run what at the time was his newest far-fetched idea: An underground transit play known as The Boring Company. On his watch, The Boring Company raised hundreds of millions of dollars and built a few short so-called “Tesla tunnels” in Las Vegas. But the company has also ended up dropping its previously announced plans for tunnels in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago, according to The Wall Street Journal. Davis has a reputation as a relentless negotiator, and Musk brought him on board at Twitter to help with the takeover and subsequent slash-and-burn. Davis and his family reportedly slept in a makeshift bedroom at the company’s headquarters during this time. In a 2023 lawsuit against Twitter filed by former employees, the plaintiffs alleged that Davis said to the effect of, “we don’t have to follow those rules,” in response to a request to get permits to install a bathroom for Musk. Davis has served as a member of the board of advisers of the Atlas Society, a group centered around the philosophy of Ayn Rand, per Bloomberg. Davis is now helping Musk slash government headcount, which Rand once called the “worst part” of the “producers’ burden.” Nicole Hollander garnered public attention in the aftermath of Elon Musk’s $44 billion acquisition of Twitter in early 2022. The George Washington University alum and former employee of real estate developer JGB Smith (per her LinkedIn profile) was part of the polarizing Twitter transition team that upended the company and slashed its workforce. As part of that transition, Hollander and Musk ally Steve Davis moved into the company’s headquarters with their infant, according to a civil lawsuit filed in 2023. The lawsuit was filed by several former Twitter employees against X Corp., the Musk entity that took over. The plaintiffs said in the complaint Hollander was not employed by any of Musk’s companies at that time. Hollander’s relationship with Davis — and her current employment at X — has kept her in Musk’s circle. Her role at DOGE doesn’t have an official title, at least one that is public. However, Wired reported in late January that Hollander has high-level access to federal agencies and an official government email address. Hollander is working at the GSA, per Wired, where she oversaw the accidental disclosure of a secret CIA facility, per the publication’s follow-up reporting. Role: Senior Advisor, Office of Personnel Management Brian Bjelde is a true Elon Musk veteran, with 21 years at SpaceX, where he was employee No. 14 and continues to work today. While he started as an avionics engineer, Bjelde has spent the last decade running the company’s human resources department. In a 2014 Reddit “ask me anything,” Bjelde said that at SpaceX, “We try not to limit our thinking except by the limits imposed by physics.” Several former employees sued SpaceX and Musk in 2024 alleging sexual harassment and a hostile work environment. According to the complaint, Bjelde once starred in a video for the space company where a staffer spanked him — an apparent attempt at tongue-in-cheek humor — and he also was involved in the firings of several employees who spoke up about the company’s culture in 2022. Prior to SpaceX, Bjelde spent a year at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory after graduating from the University of Southern California with a master’s degree in astronautical engineering. At DOGE, Bjelde is reportedly a senior advisor at OPM. Role: Chief of Staff, Office of Personnel Management Amanda Scales doesn’t directly work for DOGE, but is now chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management, the federal government’s main human resources department, according to an OPM memo. Scales used to work on talent acquisition at Musk’s company x.AI until January 2025, according to her LinkedIn profile. She also worked in human resources and talent at San Francisco-based VC firm Human Capital, as well as at Uber. Scales graduated from University of California, Davis in 2012 with degrees in psychology and economics, per her LinkedIn. Role: Head of IT at X; Former DOGE Operative Spikes serves as the head of IT at X since February 2025, according to his LinkedIn profile. Prior to that, he said in his X bio that he had “most recently” worked for DOGE. Spikes recently confirmed to journalist Brian Krebs that he worked for DOGE for two months in Washington, D.C. “to help save [the country] from certain bankruptcy.” Spikes is a longtime Musk insider, touting on his LinkedIn profile that he was the fourth hire at SpaceX and was among the first employees at PayPal. Spikes’ ex-wife is married to Musk’s cousin, Krebs reported. Role: Long-time Musk assistantJehn Balajadia first joined the Musk ecosystem in 2017, according to her LinkedIn profile, which lists her title as operations coordinator at The Boring Company. But LinkedIn records don’t always reflect actual positions — and their evolution — in Musk’s world. In 2018, Balajadia took over the executive assistant to the office of CEO position, a role that included managing all of Musk’s activities and often those of his family members, according to interactions between a TechCrunch reporter and SpaceX and Musk employees at the time. Today, Balajadia has a role within DOGE. According to The New York Times, she is listed in the employee directory of the Education Department. The book “Breaking Twitter” claims Balajadia once told another Musk official that her job was to “take care” of him, and she reportedly often travels with Musk. When Musk took over Twitter, Balajadia was named chief of staff, and she was the one who delivered letters of dismissal to several Twitter executives, per Walter Isaacson’s book on Elon Musk. Prior to joining Tesla, Balajadia worked at Red Bull, NBCUniversal, and Walt Disney. Role: Senior Advisor to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management Riccardo Biasini entered into Musk’s orbit in 2011 when he joined Tesla as an engineer after completing his master’s degree in automotive engineering from the University of Pisa, Italy the previous year. During his five years at Tesla, Biasini focused much of his attention on Autopilot, the company’s branded advanced driver assistance system, according to his own account outlined in a Medium post. He led development of Autopilot’s traffic-aware cruise control and other driver assistance features before taking responsibility for the architecture of controls, safety, and functional behavior of the electric propulsion system. Biasini left Tesla and joined Comma.ai in 2016, where he developed the automated lateral and longitudinal controls for the startup’s first self-driving car system. He later became VP of quality and eventually was named CEO in 2018 after founder George Hotz stepped down from the leadership role. Biasini went back to work for Musk in 2019 as director of electrical and software engineering at The Boring Company. At DOGE, Biasini is senior advisor to the director of the Office of Personnel Management, according to a lawsuit filed against the OPM in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which provides his title as listed on an OPM document entitled “Privacy Impact Assessment for Government-Wide Email System.” Role: Acting DOGE administrator Amy Gleason is the acting DOGE administrator, according to the White House, making Gleason the official albeit ostensible head of the Department of Government Efficiency, even if Elon Musk is largely calling the shots. The White House confirmed Gleason’s position to TechCrunch. Gleason previously served at the U.S. Digital Service — now DOGE — between October 2018 and December 2021, according to her LinkedIn profile, which TechCrunch has seen. Gleason also previously worked as chief product officer at Russell Street Ventures between December 2021 and November 2024. Gleason, who was in Mexico on vacation at the time when she learned of her appointment, reports to the White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, per the executive order establishing DOGE. President Trump has continued to refer to Musk as heading and leading DOGE. Gleason has not made any public comments since her appointment, but was court-ordered to answer questions about DOGE’s role and whether it is a government agency subject to Freedom of Information laws. Role: Senior Advisor to the Commissioner and former Chief Information Officer, Social Security Administration Michael Russo, a former technology executive, began serving as the chief information officer at the Social Security Administration in early February. As CIO, Russo oversaw the agency’s IT systems and information security. In late March, DOGE associate Scott Coulter replaced Russo as the SSA CIO, according to the agency’s website. Russo began serving as a senior advisor to the Social Security Administration’s Commissioner. During his brief time as CIO, Russo, who is aligned with DOGE, reportedly quickly gave access to several DOGE staffers at the agency, including Akash Bobba and Coulter, among others, according to a lawsuit brought by unions representing workers and a person familiar with personnel matters. Several other DOGE staffers were listed as Russo’s direct reports in the department’s staff directory, the person familiar said. Russo was previously the chief technology officer at ecommerce firm Shift4 and was a senior director at cloud giant Oracle, headed by Larry Ellison, a close ally of President Trump. Role: Former DOGE staffer with an unspecified role at White House Stanley began working for Musk in October 2022, per his LinkedIn profile, when he was hired for the “core transition team” at Twitter after Musk’s takeover. Stanley can be seen at the time taking this widely seen selfie at Twitter’s headquarters with other people who were not fired or didn’t quit when Musk took control of Twitter. Stanley served in an unspecified role at the White House, according to The New York Times. Stanley himself has hinted at working in the Trump administration on his X account. Stanley “returned to the private sector” in February, per an OPM spokesperson. On January 20, the day of Trump’s inauguration, Stanley posed next to two January 6 convicts, brothers Matthew and Andrew Valentin, who were pardoned by Trump. Stanley wrote in an X post that he was “boots on ground to ensure this was executed.” Trump’s Department of Justice liaison Paul Ingrassia wrote on X that the Valentin brothers were the first January 6 prisoners to be released. Stanley currently serves as the head of security engineering at X and the principal security engineer at SpaceX, according to his website. On his LinkedIn, Stanley says he is also the chief information security officer at X Payments, a payment service that Musk has wanted to launch as part of his “everything app” aspiration for X. Before entering Musk’s orbit, Stanley had his own cybersecurity firm, named Stanley Networks, and worked as a contractor at the state of Kentucky. He also worked at Kentucky health provider Baptist Health, which includes hospitals and other facilities. TechCrunch found an xAI-powered chatbot on a DOGE-related website subdomain on Stanley’s website, called the “Department of Government Efficiency AI Assistant,” which says it is “here to help government personnel like you identify and eliminate waste, improve efficiency, and streamline processes using a first principles approach.” Role: Expert, Office of Personnel Management Akash Bobba is a DOGE engineer who is reportedly a student at the University of California, Berkeley, according to Wired. The New Jersey native graduated high school in 2021, according to public records seen by TechCrunch. It’s unclear how his experiences brought him to DOGE. But he has had some interactions with the tech world. According to a since-deleted podcast with Aman Manazir, Bobba said he previously interned at Meta and Palantir. He also worked at Bridgewater Associates. Bobba’s website as of February 2025 points to a specific point in a YouTube video, titled, “How Tech Billionaires Plan to Destroy America,” in which Elon Musk says, “I’m not just MAGA. I’m dark gothic MAGA.” Per Wired, Bobba is listed as an “expert” in internal OPM correspondence, and reports directly to OPM’s chief of staff, Amanda Scales. According to a lawsuit filed by union workers, Bobba also has a presence at the Social Security Administration and worked under the agency’s chief information officer, Michael Russo, according to the lawsuit and a person familiar with personnel matters. Bobba was sworn into his post “over the phone, contrary to standard practice,” per the lawsuit, implying Bobba worked for DOGE at least in part remotely. Role: Special Government Employee Edward Coristine, a former intern at Neuralink and now known by his infamous LinkedIn profile handle “bigballs,” is one of the core members of the DOGE team and the youngest-known Musk aide at age 19, TechCrunch has confirmed. Since arriving in Washington, D.C., Coristine has been actively involved in accessing federal systems at several government departments, including Office of Personnel Management, the SBA, GSA and USAID, the State Department, Homeland Security, and FEMA. Coristine reportedly also has physical access to buildings at the U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA. Prior to DOGE, Coristine ran several companies under his name from his family home in New York, including DiamondCDN and Packetware, both which offered forms of DDoS protection. Coristine also used to work for DDoS mitigation company Path Network until he was fired in June 2022 following an alleged “leaking of proprietary company information that coincided with his tenure,” Path CEO Marshal Webb told TechCrunch in an email. Coristine said in a later Discord post under his handle “Rivage,” seen by TechCrunch and per other news reports, in response to his firing that he had done “nothing contractually wrong.” It was around May 2024 that Coristine went to work for Elon Musk’s Neuralink. Coristine is also a mechanical engineering and physics student at Northeastern University, and expected to graduate in 2028. Role: Chief Information Officer and former IT Specialist, Social Security Administration Scott Coulter is a DOGE staffer who serves as the chief information officer at the Social Security Administration. Coulter was initially listed as an IT specialist in the Social Security Administration’s staff directory as of mid-February, according to a person familiar. Coulter succeeded Michael Russo in March 2025. Prior to working for DOGE, Coulter headed Cowbird Capital, a New York investment fund founded in 2018, which listed assets of around $171 million as of March 2024, per a regulatory filing. Both Coulter and Cowbird were named in court documents during the Twitter v. Musk lawsuit in 2022 during Musk’s takeover of Twitter, though it’s not clear why either were named. Coulter did not respond to a request for comment sent to his government email address. Role: Special Government Employee, U.S. Treasury Since joining DOGE, Marko Elez has become a central figure in a legal battle over DOGE’s access to some of the federal government’s most sensitive systems. Now as a senior Treasury employee, Elez has access to the U.S. Treasury’s payments systems responsible for disbursing around $6 trillion in federal funds to Americans, such as Social Security checks and federal tax refunds. Named in a lawsuit challenging DOGE’s access, Elez is a “special government employee” and reportedly had wide data access privileges to the department’s systems before that access was curtailed by a federal court. He works closely with Tom Krause, another DOGE staffer and senior Treasury employee. Per a February 11 court filing, Elez is the only DOGE staffer with access to payment systems. Before government, the 25-year-old Rutgers University graduate worked at SpaceX, where he focused on vehicle telemetry, Starship, and satellite software, according to an archived copy of his website seen by TechCrunch. Elez later worked on search AI at Musk’s social media company X, per an archived copy of his website. Elez does not list any prior government experience. On February 6, Elez briefly resigned from his position at DOGE, according to the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, after The Wall Street Journal surfaced racist posts from Elez’s social media accounts. Elez returned to government after Musk posted a poll on X asking whether Elez should be rehired. Elez was reinstated at DOGE, a Washington Post reporter posted on February 18. Luke Farritor is listed as a senior advisor in several U.S. government department employee directories, including the State Department, USAID, and the Department of Energy. He also requested access to data held by Medicare and Medicaid, as well as the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. Before government, Farritor, 23, was a student at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln and was well known for decoding the writings on ancient Roman scrolls, for which he won a $700,000 prize. Later, Farritor was among the 2024 Thiel Fellowship class, an annual award given by the billionaire Peter Thiel. An archived copy of Farritor’s website says he worked for Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, who he helped to “invest a large, multistage VC fund and help run AI Grant.” (Neither Friedman or Gross responded to a request for comment.) Farritor worked as an intern at Elon Musk’s satellite internet company Starlink in mid-2022, then went on to work at SpaceX between May 2022 and July 2023, where he worked on “several mission-critical projects” leading up to Starship Flights 1 and 2, per his website. Role: DOGE “Volunteer”; Federal Detailee Gautier “Cole” Killian is described as a DOGE “volunteer” who was designated a “federal detailee” at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in early February. A federal detailee is a federal employee usually seconded from another government agency. Killian was a student at McGill University in Canada where he studied math and computer science, and was a member of McGill’s AI team between 2021 and 2022. His personal website was scrubbed from the internet in late 2024, according to his website’s public DNS records. Role: Special Advisor to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management Gavin Kliger is an alum of University of California, Berkeley, and works at Databricks. Kliger joined the DOGE team earlier in 2025. Kliger is listed as special advisor to the director of the OPM on his LinkedIn profile, per Reuters, though much of Kliger’s online life, including his X account, has since been scrubbed from the internet, including the Wayback Machine, which archives copies of webpages in case they later become unavailable. A copy of Kliger’s resume that TechCrunch has seen said he previously interned at Twitter in mid-2019. According to an email sent to USAID staff, Kliger also has a USAID email address, and was one of the DOGE staffers who is now listed in the CFPB’s staff directory, according to the CFPB’s union. ProPublica reported in May that Kliger had been advised by government ethics attorneys he held stock in companies that federal employees are forbidden from owning, and as such could not take actions that would financially benefit him personally. Court records show Kliger participated in mass layoffs at the agency, including the terminations of the lawyers who had warned him about possible ethics violations. Role: Special Government Employee, U.S. Treasury; CEO, Cloud Software Group Tom Krause is a special government employee and a senior DOGE staffer in the U.S. Treasury. He concurrently serves as the chief executive of Cloud Software Group, a private company that owns several tech firms, including remote access giant Citrix, a once public outfit that went private through a series of deals. Bloomberg reports that Krause eliminated jobs at Citrix that staff said were critical to the security of the company’s products, according to multiple employees both named and unnamed for the story. Cloud Software Group told Bloomberg it inherited weaknesses at Citrix and faced rising security threats across the industry, and that cybersecurity has improved since its private equity buyout and meets or exceeds all industry standards. Before becoming CEO of Cloud Software, Krause, who is 47, was a former executive at Broadcom; prior to that he ran a consultancy firm. Since working at the Treasury as one of Musk’s DOGE front-line staffers, Krause has worked closely with Marko Elez, another senior Treasury employee. Politico reported in May, citing financial disclosures it had obtained, that Krause reported hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of shares in several financial, banking, and tech companies, including firms that provide services to the Treasury unit that Krause oversees. Jeremy Lewin is a DOGE staffer assigned to the General Services Administration, which oversees the federal government’s massive procurement and logistics operations, Bloomberg reported. Lewin reportedly failed to gain access to a secure GSA area, resulting in a superior of his lobbying the CIA for a clearance. Lewin is a 27-year-old Harvard Law School graduate who recently worked at the same law firm, Munger, Tolles & Olson, as did U.S. Second Lady Usha Vance, The Handbasket reported. Moghaddassi is part of a DOGE team assigned to the U.S. Department of Labor, and is one of several staffers that DOGE plans to install at the U.S. Treasury, per The New York Times. Moghaddasi has worked for at least three of Musk’s companies: X and Neuralink, according to multiple media reports, and a cached copy of Moghaddassi’s X account in 2023 said he also previously worked on AI at Tesla. Moghaddassi appears to be in his twenties. In 2019, he was a sophomore at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied applied math and computer science, the Santa Fe Institute’s website says. Nikhil Rajpal studied computer science and history at the University of California, Berkeley, where he served as the president of the libertarian-leaning student political group, Students for Liberty. According to archived snapshots of his website, Rajpal worked at Twitter from 2016 until some time before Musk’s acquisition. He may have first entered Musk’s orbit prior to this, reportedly doing work redesigning a Tesla console. On behalf of DOGE, Rajpal works at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and has a DOGE email address. Schutt is a technologist with longstanding links to Republican politics and was more recently linked to political operations by Elon Musk. Schutt reportedly has access to systems at FEMA. According to his since-deleted GitHub profile, which TechCrunch has seen, Schutt works at a company called Outburst Data. According to security researchers, Outburst Data hosts part of DOGE’s website and several other Musk-related sites, including his America PAC political fundraiser. TechCrunch has also seen the same DNS records, which reference a DOGE-named subdomain. On February 14, 404 Media reported a flaw that it said allows anyone to edit DOGE’s website. Schutt also serves as the chief technology officer at Revv, an online fundraising platform that is widely used by the Republican Party, as well as co-founder of Virginia-based software company KAMM. Ethan Shaotran, 22, and a California native, is a DOGE staffer and also a Harvard University student in the class of 2025. Shaotran was first publicly linked to Musk in September 2024, when he was runner-up in a hackathon run by the billionaire’s AI company xAI. Shaotran was previously the founder of Energize.ai, though its website no longer loads. He also developed several iPhone apps, including a Donald Trump-themed running game called “Donald Dash.” Shaotran reportedly has a working GSA email address and requested access to a decade’s worth of GSA data. Shaotran also has access to email systems at the Department of Education and access to the department’s back-end website. Shaotran was temporarily detailed to the Office of the Postmaster General at the U.S. Postal Service as of March 12, 2025, according to a Freedom of Information request. Role: Director of Technology Transformation Services, GSA; Chief Information Officer, Department of Labor. Thomas Shedd is a former Tesla engineer who now serves as the director of the General Services Administration’s Technology Transformation Services, or TTS, a unit known for designing and building digital services for the federal government. Since Shedd took charge of the unit, the GSA fired its 18F division of specialist technology consultants who worked on the Internal Revenue Service’s free tax-filing system and other government projects. Several staffers also reportedly resigned after Shedd gained access to parts of Notify.gov, a system that sends mass text messages to the public during emergencies, which contains the personal information of Americans who registered. As of mid-March, Shedd was also tapped as the chief information officer at the Department of Labor, which he serves concurrently as GSA’s technology director. Shedd reportedly is looking to reduce the agency’s headcount by 30%. Prior to working in federal government, Shedd worked at Tesla for eight years, according to the GSA, where he worked on “building software that operates vehicle and battery factories.” It’s not clear what prior government service Shedd has, if any, but he has said he wants to run TTS like a “startup software company,” according to Wired magazine, including the use of AI to analyze government contracts. Jordan Wick is a former Waymo software engineer who appears to have a DOGE email account associated with the Executive Office of the President, Wired reported. Wick is among the team that was given access to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau systems. Wick is also the co-founder of Y Combinator startup Intercept, according to YC’s website. An archived version of Wick’s website says that as of 2022, he had “recently” graduated with a master’s degree in engineering from MIT. Young is a DOGE staffer who works at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, per Bloomberg Law. Young is a “top Republican field operative” who was hired as Musk’s political advisor in 2024, The New York Times reported. Young has worked in Republican politics since at least 2007, according to his LinkedIn profile. ProPublica has since reported that Young earns as much as $1 million annually as a political adviser to Musk while also helping to dismantle the federal regulator and its consumer protection rules. Role: Unofficial Advisor to DOGE Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Silicon Valley VC firm Andreesen Horowitz, doesn’t formally work for DOGE but has acted as “a key networker for talent recruitment” at the agency, according to The Washington Post. Andreessen has jokingly referred to himself as an “unpaid intern” for DOGE, as well. Cooper is a Palantir engineer who worked on DOGE’s recruiting efforts in late 2024, according to Wired. He graduated from Pennsylvania’s Lehigh University in 2019 with a bachelor’s degree in computer science and business, according to his LinkedIn profile. Cooper worked to hire other Palantirians to join DOGE as they are “the most exceptional people I know,” he wrote in a message, seen by Wired. Hiremath, 32, is the co-founder of video recording startup Loom, which was sold to Atlassian in 2023 for $975 million. According to a blog post on his website titled “I am rich and have no idea what to do with my life,” Hiremath worked for DOGE in late 2024 for about a month making hundreds of recruiting calls. He wrote that he was added to DOGE-tied Signal groups and “immediately put to work.” While Hiremath praised DOGE’s work as “extremely important,” Hiremath said he quit as he needed to focus on himself, calling off plans to move to Washington, D.C. and going to Hawaii instead. Role: DOGE RecruiterJancso is a former Palantir software engineer who also worked on DOGE’s recruitment efforts late in 2024, according to Wired. In 2023, Jancso co-founded Accelerate SF, an initiative that taps engineers to solve the city’s problems with AI. Jancso’s exact age isn’t public, but he graduated from University College London in 2021 with a bachelor’s degree in economics according to his LinkedIn profile, seen by TechCrunch. Jancso was himself recruited to DOGE by Boring Company president Steve Davis. Kratsios helped lead efforts to staff DOGE in late 2024, conducting interviews of prospective staff, Bloomberg reported. Kratsios was previously managing director of Scale AI and the chief technology officer of the United States under President Trump’s first term. He was also a principal at Thiel Capital, a VC firm founded by Peter Thiel, from 2014 to 2017, according to his LinkedIn. Role: DOGE Advisor & Spokesperson Katie Miller is a Trump-appointed advisor to DOGE, and has served as its spokesperson. Miller served in the first Trump administration and is the spouse of Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller. Miller also serves on a presidential advisory board related to intelligence matters.

    "content": "Elon Musk is moving forward with his plans to turn the company formerly known as Twitter, now called X, into an “everything app” that includes its own payments system. The company in late November was granted three additional money transmitter licenses in the U.S. states of South Dakota (on November 27), Kansas (on November 28) and Wyoming (on November 30), bringing the total number of states where the company is allowed to engage in money transfers to 12. The other states where the company had previously been granted a money transmitter license include Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. All of the states were licensed this year, starting with New Hampshire on June 29. Arizona, Michigan and Missouri were added in July followed by Georgia, Maryland and Rhode Island in August, and Iowa and Mississippi in September. The registrations are associated with a business named “X Payments LLC,” formerly “Twitter Payments LLC,” which will operate the money transfer operations at X. (The name of the license may vary, but all would allow X to process payments or move money in the state.) Musk confirmed the additions in a post on X, in response to an article by The Street which noted the November 27 addition of South Dakota. The Street’s reporting indicated the company had only been registered in 10 states, according to the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System’s database. Now, the database is showing the most recent additions, as well. “Progress,” was Musk’s only comment on the new registrations. However, Musk has previously spoken about his plans to morph X into a payments platform, having earlier detailed his vision for the future of the company shortly after the acquisition. He has described Twitter, now X, as a place where users would be able to send money to others on the platform, and extract their funds to authenticated bank accounts, and perhaps later, a high-yield money market account that would encourage people to keep their cash in accounts with X. This plan would put X into competition with PayPal, a company Musk is crediting with co-founding via its merger with his X.com. With Twitter, Musk is hoping to once again complete the vision he had for X.com as a disruptor to the existing banking system. Whether or not that move will also involve crypto is yet to be determined, but it’s worth noting that a money transmitter license would be required if X were to support cryptocurrencies. Payments are also tied into X’s broader move into the creator economy, where X users with at least 500 followers and 5 million organic impressions on their posts over the past three months can become eligible for ads revenue sharing. Of course, X’s ability to monetize via ads has taken a downturn in recent days, as an advertiser exodus was prompted by Musk’s endorsement of an antisemitic post on the platform and reports that brands’ campaigns were appearing next to hate speech. As a result, X has lost several larger advertisers, including Apple, Disney, IBM, Paramount, Warner Bros., Lionsgate, Comcast/NBCU, Walmart and others. The company also lost a deal with Paris Hilton’s 11:11 Media, which would have seen the celeb tout live audio, live video and live shopping on X. Musk lashed out at Hilton after the deal went south, but the departures could spell trouble for X’s monetization plans, and therefor its creator economy and payments ambitions. The company said it would focus on small business advertisers in the near term and is also planning to make Musk’s new AI, Grok, available to X’s paid subscribers as another source of revenue.

    "content": "Instagram Threads now has more than 130 million monthly active users, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings today. The text-based social networking app is one of the many new projects that have sprung up in the wake of Elon Musk’s 2022 acquisition of Twitter, now called X, where it competes with various startups and open source projects, including Bluesky, Mastodon, Nostr, Post, Spill and others. Zuckerberg said that Threads is “growing steadily,” though characterized the app as having blown up before Meta was ready. “I’ll note that Threads now has more people actively using it today than it did during its initial launch peak,” said Zuckerberg. “So that one’s I think on track to be a major success.” Last quarter, Zuckerberg also spoke highly of Threads, saying he believed the app had a good chance of reaching 1 billion users within a few years. At the time, Threads had north of 100 million monthly active users. Meta said its family of apps, which also includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, were used by 3.19 billion people daily in the fourth quarter, up from the 3.14 billion it saw in the quarter ending September 2023. Monthly active users were at 3.98 billion, up from 3.96 billion in the prior quarter. We’ve seen evidence that Threads has been gaining traction in recent weeks. App intelligence provider Appfigures found that the Instagram-owned app had tripled its downloads in December to become the No. 6 most downloaded app in the month across the Apple App Store and Google Play. X, still struggling with its rebranding, was No. 36. By leveraging Instagram’s friend graph, Threads had a record-breaking launch, reaching 100 million registered users within its first five days last July. But interest in Threads began to taper off in the fall, only returning to growth as Meta gave it a push by promoting Threads’ viral posts to Facebook users. That likely helped the app secure its spot in the top 10 most downloaded apps globally in December. Zuckerberg’s comments were likely meant to head off concerns that had been raised during Threads’ downturn, which had some critics prematurely declaring it dead. That doesn’t appear to be the case any more — and a third-party tracker says Threads has an estimated 160 million total users. As for Meta’s earnings, the company saw $40.1 billion in revenue in the quarter ending in December 2023, ahead of analysts’ estimates of $39.18 billion and earnings of $5.33 per share, ahead of estimates of $4.96. Net income was $14.02 billion. Revenue for the full-year 2023 was $134.90 billion. Meta also announced its first cash dividend of $0.50 per share, which will be paid in March to Meta’s shareholders.

    "content": "Luminar founder and CEO Austin Russell’s bid to buy Forbes Global Media Holdings has ended. Integrated Whale Media Investments, the Hong Kong-based parent company of Forbes, terminated the agreement with Russell after he failed to secure the ideal group of investors needed to close the deal. Bloomberg was the first to report the news, citing an internal memo by Forbes Chief Executive Officer Mike Federle. “The Forbes acquisition was all about impact, and to further the philosophy of business-for-good and philanthropy with the next generation of capitalism,” a statement provided by Austin Russell’s family office reads. “At this juncture, it was determined that it was in the best interest of the parties that the contract be terminated. We wish nothing but the best to the Forbes team.” Russell, the 28-year-old founder and tech star, announced back in May plans to buy an 82% stake in Forbes Global Media Holdings in a deal that values the company at nearly $800 million. The intention, which was initially successful, was to bring in a number of investors to back the acquisition. The deal was supposed to close November 1, but fell apart after Indian investment firm Sun Group and others didn’t wire the money they were contractually obligated to, Axios reported earlier this month. Sun Group vice chair Shiv Khemka had reportedly committed to invest $300 million into the acquisition. Russell was granted an extension to the deadline and has spent the past two weeks shoring up the multimillion-dollar shortfall. In another wrinkle, an updated agreement sent to the Russell camp contained terms to the investor group that were described as untenable, according to sources familiar with the deal. Forbes, a media company perhaps best known for its magazine and lists that rank billionaires, sold 95% of the company to Integrated Whale Media back in 2014. Forbes Media had planned to go public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Magnum Opus Acquisition Limited, but called off the agreement in June 2022. Forbes has been up for sale ever since. Russell — who was described by Forbes itself in 2021 as the world’s youngest self-made billionaire — was the latest example of a tech magnate getting into the media business. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post in 2013 and Salesforce chair, CEO and co-founder Marc Benioff, along with his wife Lynne Benioff, acquired Time from parent company Meredith Corporation for $190 million in cash in 2018. More recently, Elon Musk bought Twitter in a tumultuous deal that has resulted in the social media site’s name change to X. Bring a +1 and save 60%Have a +1 you’d like to bring to Disrupt?

    "content": "Earlier this year, a developer was shocked by a message that appeared on his personal phone: “Apple detected a targeted mercenary spyware attack against your iPhone.” “I was panicking,” Jay Gibson, who asked that we don’t use his real name over fears of retaliation, told TechCrunch. Gibson, who until recently built surveillance technologies for Western government hacking tools maker Trenchant, may be the first documented case of someone who builds exploits and spyware being themselves targeted with spyware. “What the hell is going on? I really didn’t know what to think of it,” said Gibson, adding that he turned off his phone and put it away on that day, March 5. “I went immediately to buy a new phone. I called my dad. It was a mess. It was a huge mess.” At Trenchant, Gibson worked on developing iOS zero-days, meaning finding vulnerabilities and developing tools capable of exploiting them that are not known to the vendor who makes the affected hardware or software, such as Apple. “I have mixed feelings of how pathetic this is, and then extreme fear because once things hit this level, you never know what’s going to happen,” he told TechCrunch. But the ex-Trenchant employee may not be the only exploit developer targeted with spyware. According to three sources who have direct knowledge of these cases, there have been other spyware and exploit developers in the last few months who have received notifications from Apple alerting them that they were targeted with spyware. Apple did not respond to a request for comment from TechCrunch. Contact Us Do you have more information about the alleged leak of Trenchant hacking tools? Or about this developer’s story? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or by email. The targeting of Gibson’s iPhone shows that the proliferation of zero-days and spyware is starting to ensnare more types of victims. Spyware and zero-day makers have historically claimed their tools are only deployed by vetted government customers against criminals and terrorists. But for the past decade, researchers at the University of Toronto’s digital rights group Citizen Lab, Amnesty International, and other organizations have found dozens of cases where governments used these tools to target dissidents, journalists, human rights defenders, and political rivals all over the world. The closest public cases of security researchers being targeted by hackers happened in 2021 and 2023, when North Korean government hackers were caught targeting security researchers working in vulnerability research and development. Two days after receiving the Apple threat notification, Gibson contacted a forensic expert who has extensive experience investigating spyware attacks. After performing an initial analysis of Gibson’s phone, the expert did not find any signs of infection, but still recommended a deeper forensic analysis of the exploit developer’s phone. A forensic analysis would have entailed sending the expert a complete backup of the device, something Gibson said he was not comfortable with. “Recent cases are getting tougher forensically, and some we find nothing on. It may also be that the attack was not actually fully sent after the initial stages, we don’t know,” the expert told TechCrunch. Without a full forensic analysis of Gibson’s phone, ideally one where investigators found traces of the spyware and who made it, it’s impossible to know why he was targeted or who targeted him. But Gibson told TechCrunch that he believes the threat notification he received from Apple is connected to the circumstances of his departure from Trenchant, where he claims the company designated him as a scapegoat for a damaging leak of internal tools. Apple sends out threat notifications specifically for when it has evidence that a person was targeted by a mercenary spyware attack. This kind of surveillance technology is often invisibly and remotely planted on someone’s phone without their knowledge by exploiting vulnerabilities in the phone’s software, exploits that can be worth millions of dollars and can take months to develop. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies typically have the legal authority to deploy spyware on targets, not the spyware makers themselves. Sara Banda, a spokesperson for Trenchant’s parent company L3Harris, declined to comment for this story when reached by TechCrunch before publication. A month before he received Apple’s threat notification, when Gibson was still working at Trenchant, he said he was invited to go to the company’s London office for a team-building event. When Gibson arrived on February 3, he was immediately summoned into a meeting room to speak via video call with Peter Williams, Trenchant’s then-general manager who was known inside the company as “Doogie.” (In 2018, defense contractor L3Harris acquired zero-day makers Azimuth and Linchpin Labs, two sister startups that merged to become Trenchant.) Williams told Gibson the company suspected he was double employed and was thus suspending him. All of Gibson’s work devices would be confiscated and analyzed as part of an internal investigation into the allegations. Williams could not be reached for comment. “I was in shock. I didn’t really know how to react because I couldn’t really believe what I was hearing,” said Gibson, who explained that a Trenchant IT employee then went to his apartment to pick up his company-issued equipment. Around two weeks later, Gibson said Williams called and told him that following the investigation, the company was firing him and offering him a settlement agreement and payment. Gibson said Williams declined to explain what the forensic analysis of his devices had found, and essentially told him he had no choice but to sign the agreement and depart the company. Feeling like he had no alternative, Gibson said he went along with the offer and signed. Gibson told TechCrunch he later heard from former colleagues that Trenchant suspected he had leaked some unknown vulnerabilities in Google’s Chrome browser, tools that Trenchant had developed. Gibson, and three former colleagues of his, however, told TechCrunch he did not have access to Trenchant’s Chrome zero-days, given that he was part of the team exclusively developing iOS zero-days and spyware. Trenchant teams only have strictly compartmentalized access to tools related to the platforms they are working on, the people said. “I know I was a scapegoat. I wasn’t guilty. It’s very simple,” said Gibson. “I didn’t do absolutely anything other than working my ass off for them.” The story of the accusations against Gibson and his subsequent suspension and firing was independently corroborated by three former Trenchant employees with knowledge. Two of the other former Trenchant employees said they knew details of Gibson’s London trip and were aware of suspected leaks of sensitive company tools. All of them asked not to be named but believe Trenchant got it wrong.

    "content": "New data indicates that use of Meta AI’s mobile app for iOS and Android has seen a significant increase. According to a new analysis from market intelligence provider Similarweb, the app’s daily active users across both platforms jumped to 2.7 million as of October 17, up from around 775,000 just four weeks ago. In addition, Meta AI’s app installs are also up, reaching 300,000 new downloads per day, compared with under 200,000 daily downloads a few weeks ago. For comparison, Meta AI’s app had just 4,000 daily downloads a year ago, on October 17, 2024. The firm says it hasn’t seen any meaningful correlation in either search or advertising estimates, but notes Meta could be running Facebook or Instagram promotions that wouldn’t be captured in its model. However, there’s also another possible explanation for the sharp rise: the launch of Meta’s new Vibes feed in September, which introduced short-form AI-generated videos to the Meta AI mobile app. Meta AI introduced the Vibes feed on September 25, which correlates with the sharp increase in the app’s daily active users on iOS and Android, as seen in the chart below. Recently, OpenAI’s video generator Sora drew headlines as its app reached the top of the App Store when users rushed to try the new technology. However, Meta AI could have benefited from this launch as well. While Similarweb says its data doesn’t prove cause and effect, it’s possible that the attention to Sora drove some people to try Meta AI, in order to compare the two experiences. Another possibility is that Meta could be benefiting from Sora’s invite-only status. That is, those who couldn’t try out the OpenAI app may have looked for an alternative to experiment with. This would be an interesting explanation, too, as it suggests that OpenAI’s decision to gatekeep Sora may have directly boosted its rivals. As of October 17, Meta AI’s app had seen a 15.58% increase in daily active users worldwide, while ChatGPT, Grok, and Perplexity saw declines of 3.51%, 7.35%, and 2.29%, respectively.

    "content": "Apple has rolled out a new feature that makes it easier to customize Liquid Glass to your liking. Now users will be able to set the appearance of Liquid Glass to either Clear or Tinted, with the help of a new setting included in the latest beta update of its mobile and desktop operating systems. The addition indicates Apple is listening closely to user feedback in these early days of the iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 public launches. Apples likes to push through more significant changes, but it will often offer a fallback option for those who have a hard time adjusting. That was the case when Apple moved Safari’s address to the bottom of the screen in 2021. After some user backlash over the then controversial decision, the iPhone maker added an option to revert the bar to the top of the screen. (Apple, we’ll concede, was right to make the move; the bar’s location is better when it’s in easier reach of your thumbs.) Now Apple is taking a similar approach with Liquid Glass. The new user interface that shipped with iOS 26 and other Apple operating systems was the company’s biggest design overhaul since its move from a skeuomorphic to flat design back in 2013. As with most changes of this scale and significance, not everybody has been on board. Some have said the Liquid Glass design makes various parts of the interface harder to read, including notifications or navigation controls in apps like Apple Music and others. Others have said they love Liquid Glass’s attention to detail and its new look, which felt like a more modern update to an interface that had grown stale over the years. With another potential divisive response on its hands, Apple is now ceding some control over Liquid Glass’s appearance back to the users. iOS 26.1 tinted or clear option and what they look like. pic.twitter.com/4eSnb6iJss The new feature, first spotted by 9to5Mac, arrived in iOS 26.1 beta 4 and the accompanying updates for tablets and desktop computers. Reached for comment, Apple told TechCrunch that, during the beta period this summer, it heard from some users who wanted the option to set a more opaque look for Liquid Glass. This new setting that lets users personalize Liquid Glass is available in iOS 26.1, iPadOS 26.1, and macOS 26.1. To access the feature, beta users can visit the “Display & Brightness” menu under Settings to find the added Liquid Glass menu option. On Mac, it’s under “Appearance” in System Settings. The control lets you choose between two options, Clear and Tinted. The latter increases the opacity of interface elements, making them easier to see. Choose your fighter: Tinted vs Clear for Notifications in iOS 26.1 beta 4 pic.twitter.com/OkuFNSsEKB Though some users had been advocating for a slider that lets them control the opacity more precisely, Apple has opted for a toggle where it specifies the two levels of tint that users can choose from. Apple told TechCrunch that any developers who have already implemented Liquid Glass in their apps will automatically have the user’s preference applied. Developers are able to test this now in the 26.1 developer beta. After selecting their preferred option, users will see changes across user interface elements, like the Now Playing controls, Notifications on the Lock Screen, and in Apple’s apps and those from third-party developers. While the beta feature arrives for developers today, the public beta should arrive over the next few days ahead of the wider public release.

    "content": "Grok, a ChatGPT competitor developed by xAI, Elon Musk’s AI startup, has officially launched on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. Grok began rolling out late this afternoon to X Premium Plus subscribers in the U.S., “Premium Plus” being X’s plan that costs $16 per month for ad-free access to the social network. Longtime subscribers will get priority access to Grok, X said, with the rollout expected to wrap up in the next week. Grok answers questions conversationally, drawing on a knowledge base similar to that used to train the AI models powering ChatGPT and Google’s Bard. It lives in the X side menu on the web, iOS and Android and can be added to the bottom menu in X’s mobile apps for quicker access. Grok is underpinned by a generative model called Grok-1, which was trained on data both from the web (up to Q3 2023) and feedback from human assistants. Unlike other chatbots, Grok can also incorporate real-time data from posts on X into its responses, enabling it to answer questions with — in theory — up-to-the-minute info. The real-time access to X data appears to be a genuine advantage — Grok’s “killer feature,” if you will. Given a prompt such as “What is happening in AI today?” chatbots like Bard and ChatGPT provide vague, outdated answers that reflect the limits of their training data and filters on their web access. Grok, by contrast, pieces together a response from very recent headlines — although it’s not clear how it’s making its source selections and how often it might hallucinate wrong answers. Same query on Grok, ChatGPT, and Bard! 🤯 We are vastly underestimating the power of real-time data. Grok nails it! h/t Scobleizer pic.twitter.com/mWH8FMFxIG — Bindu Reddy (@bindureddy) December 7, 2023 Asking Grok how many Q Followers there are on X pic.twitter.com/kaHL8GUJ0Z — MoCheezePlz (@Yeahaboutthat3) December 7, 2023 Musk has previously alluded to Grok having “a bit of wit” and “a rebellious streak” — and a willingness to answer “spicy questions that are rejected by most other AI systems.” Indeed, judging by screenshots from early Grok users on X, there appears to be some truth to that. Told to “be vulgar,” Grok will happily oblige, spewing profanities and colorful language you won’t hear from Bard or ChatGPT. X leans into the countercultural image, suggesting on the Grok home screen a “roast” prompt that when selected has Grok rudely critique a user based on their recent X post history. I JUST GOT ACCESS TO GROK AND IT ROASTED MY X ACCOUNT ELONS BRINGING HUMOR BACK TO AI pic.twitter.com/3mjrXIxO80 — amit (@amitisinvesting) December 7, 2023 Even when not prompted to be outright vulgar, there’s a colloquial, first-person bent to many of Grok’s responses — evoking an AI that the late Douglas Adams might’ve conjured up. I can’t say I’ve seen ChatGPT or Bard refer to people as “my dear human friend” or “enigmatic Anons.” I asked Grok if he’s a fan of Anons in this great awakening. Hehe. :) pic.twitter.com/Ct8ASvdCzJ — HappJoy (@LetItRainShine) December 7, 2023 Nor will Bard and ChatGPT answer “happy wife, happy life” to challenges of their accuracy. Grok is wise https://t.co/XXdjPXvhSv — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 7, 2023 Some users suggest that Grok “sounds way more intelligent” than other chatbots as a result of its edgy “personality.” As for this writer, I’m not so sure. Cutesy prose and crassness — however entertaining or inflammatory — don’t equate with cleverness, necessarily. There are signs of roughness around Grok’s edges; Grok refers to posts on X as “tweets,” for instance. Jokes and foul language apart, Grok's responses are so entertaining because it sounds way more intelligent than the other ChatLLM apps Fundamentally, the safety RLHF makes the other LLMs dumber… You are killing off part of the LLM brain by overly censoring it. h/t… pic.twitter.com/rhZQff4rdp Plus, even Grok has limits.

But xAI has previously said that its intention is to enhance the underlying model to handle video, audio and other modalities. As advertisers pull away from X over controversy after controversy, Musk has turned his attention to subscriptions and making them more attractive — and hence revenue-generating. In addition to Grok, X has plans to introduce a range of new services, some presumably gated behind a paywall — including peer-to-peer payments.

    "content": "Google says that it plans to roll out changes to Google Search to make clearer which images in results were AI generated — or edited by AI tools. In the next few months, Google will begin to flag AI-generated and -edited images in the “About this image” window on Search, Google Lens, and the Circle to Search feature on Android. Similar disclosures may make their way to other Google properties, like YouTube, in the future; Google says it’ll have more to share on that later this year. Crucially, only images containing “C2PA metadata” will be flagged as AI-manipulated in Search. C2PA, short for Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, is a group developing technical standards to trace an image’s history, including the equipment and software used to capture and/or create it. Companies, including Google, Amazon, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Adobe, back C2PA. But the coalition’s standards haven’t seen widespread adoption. As The Verge noted in a recent piece, the C2PA faces plenty of adoption and interoperability challenges; only a handful of generative AI tools and cameras from Leica and Sony support the group’s specs. Moreover, C2PA metadata — like any metadata — can be removed or scrubbed, or become corrupted to the point where it’s unreadable. And images from some of the more popular generative AI tools, like Flux, which xAI’s Grok chatbot uses for image generation, don’t have C2PA metadata attached to them in part because their creators haven’t agreed to back the standard. Some measures are better than none, granted, as deepfakes continue to rapidly spread. According to one estimate, there was a 245% increase in scams involving AI-generated content from 2023 to 2024. Deloitte projects that deepfake-related losses will soar from $12.3 billion in 2023 to $40 billion by 2027. Surveys show that the majority of people are concerned about being fooled by a deepfake and about AI’s potential to promote the spread of propaganda.

    "content": "Elon Musk’s xAI released its Grok large language model as “open source” over the weekend. The billionaire clearly hopes to set his company at odds with rival OpenAI, which, despite its name, is not particularly open. But does releasing the code for something like Grok actually contribute to the AI development community? Yes and no. Grok is a chatbot trained by xAI to fill the same vaguely defined role as something like ChatGPT or Claude: You ask it, it answers. This LLM, however, was given a sassy tone and extra access to Twitter data as a way of differentiating it from the rest. As always, these systems are nearly impossible to evaluate, but the general consensus seems to be that it’s competitive with last-generation, medium-size models like GPT-3.5. (Whether you decide this is impressive given the short development time frame or disappointing given the budget and bombast surrounding xAI is entirely up to you.) At any rate, Grok is a modern and functional LLM of significant size and capability, and the more access the dev community has to the guts of such things, the better. The problem is in defining “open” in a way that does more than let a company (or billionaire) claim the moral high ground. This isn’t the first time the terms “open” and “open source” have been questioned or abused in the AI world. And we aren’t just talking about a technical quibble, such as picking a usage license that’s not as open as another (Grok is Apache 2.0, if you’re wondering). 5 investors on the pros and cons of open source AI business models To begin with, AI models are unlike other software when it comes to making them “open source.” If you’re making, say, a word processor, it’s relatively simple to make it open source: You publish all your code publicly and let community to propose improvements or make their own version. Part of what makes open source as a concept valuable is that every aspect of the application is original or credited to its original creator — this transparency and adherence to correct attribution is not just a byproduct, but is core to the very concept of openness. With AI, this is arguably not possible at all, because the way machine learning models are created involves a largely unknowable process whereby a tremendous amount of training data is distilled into a complex statistical representation the structure of which no human really directed, or even understands. This process cannot be inspected, audited, and improved the way traditional code can — so while it still has immense value in one sense, it can’t ever really be open. (The standards community hasn’t even defined what open will be in this context, but are actively discussing it.) That hasn’t stopped AI developers and companies from designing and claiming their models as “open,” a term that has lost much of its meaning in this context. Some call their model “open” if there is a public-facing interface or API. Some call it “open” if they release a paper describing the development process. Arguably the closest to “open source” an AI model can be is when its developers release its weights, which is to say the exact attributes of the countless nodes of its neural networks, which perform vector mathematics operations in precise order to complete the pattern started by a user’s input. But even “open-weights” models like LLaMa-2 exclude other important data, like the training dataset and process — which would be necessary to recreate it from scratch. (Some projects go further, of course.) All this is before even mentioning the fact that it takes millions of dollars in computing and engineering resources to create or replicate these models, effectively restricting who can create and replicate them to companies with considerable resources. xAI open sources base model of Grok, but without any training code So where does xAI’s Grok release fall on this spectrum? As an open-weights model, it’s ready for anyone to download, use, modify, fine tune, or distill. That’s good! It appears to be among the largest models anyone can access freely this way, in terms of parameters — 314 billion — which gives curious engineers a lot to work with if they want to test how it performs after various modifications. The size of the model comes with serious drawbacks, though. You’ll need hundreds of gigabytes of high-speed RAM to use it in this raw form. If you’re not already in possession of, say, a dozen Nvidia H100s in a six-figure AI inference rig, don’t bother clicking that download link. And although Grok is arguably competitive with some other modern models, it’s also far, far larger than them, meaning it requires more resources to accomplish the same thing. There’s always a hierarchy of size, efficiency, and other metrics, and it’s still valuable, but this is more raw material than final product. It’s also not clear whether this is the latest and best version of Grok, like the clearly tuned version some have access to via X. Overall, it’s a good thing to release this data, but it’s not a game-changer the way some hoped it might be. It’s also hard not to wonder why Musk is doing this. Is his nascent AI company really dedicated to open source development? Or is this just mud in the eye of OpenAI, with which Musk is currently pursuing a billionaire-level beef? If they are really dedicated to open source development, this will be the first of many releases, and they will hopefully take the feedback of the community into account, release other crucial information, characterize the training data process, and further explain their approach. If they aren’t, and this is only done so Musk can point to it in online arguments, it’s still valuable — just not something anyone in the AI world will rely on or pay much attention to after the next few months as they play with the model.

    "content": "Some users on Elon Musk’s X are turning to Musk’s AI bot Grok for fact-checking, raising concerns among human fact-checkers that this could fuel misinformation. Earlier this month, X enabled users to call out xAI’s Grok and ask questions on different things. The move was similar to Perplexity, which has been running an automated account on X to offer a similar experience. Soon after xAI created Grok’s automated account on X, users started experimenting with asking it questions. Some people in markets, including India, began asking Grok to fact-check comments and questions that target specific political beliefs. Fact-checkers are concerned about using Grok — or any other AI assistant of this sort — in this manner because the bots can frame their answers to sound convincing, even if they are not factually correct. Instances of spreading fake news and misinformation were seen with Grok in the past. In August last year, five state secretaries urged Musk to implement critical changes to Grok after the misleading information generated by the assistant surfaced on social networks ahead of the U.S. election. Other chatbots, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, were also seen to be generating inaccurate information on the election last year. Separately, disinformation researchers found in 2023 that AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, could easily be used to produce convincing text with misleading narratives. “AI assistants, like Grok, they’re really good at using natural language and give an answer that sounds like a human being said it. And in that way, the AI products have this claim on naturalness and authentic sounding responses, even when they’re potentially very wrong. That would be the danger here,” Angie Holan, director of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) at Poynter, told TechCrunch. Unlike AI assistants, human fact-checkers use multiple, credible sources to verify information. They also take full accountability for their findings, with their names and organizations attached to ensure credibility. Pratik Sinha, co-founder of India’s non-profit fact-checking website Alt News, said that although Grok currently appears to have convincing answers, it is only as good as the data it is supplied with. “Who’s going to decide what data it gets supplied with, and that is where government interference, etc., will come into picture,” he noted. “There is no transparency. Anything which lacks transparency will cause harm because anything that lacks transparency can be molded in any which way.” In one of the responses posted earlier this week, Grok’s account on X acknowledged that it “could be misused — to spread misinformation and violate privacy.” However, the automated account does not show any disclaimers to users when they get its answers, leading them to be misinformed if it has, for instance, hallucinated the answer, which is the potential disadvantage of AI. “It may make up information to provide a response,” Anushka Jain, a research associate at Goa-based multidisciplinary research collective Digital Futures Lab, told TechCrunch. There’s also some question about how much Grok uses posts on X as training data, and what quality-control measures it uses to fact-check such posts. Last summer, it pushed out a change that appeared to allow Grok to consume X user data by default. The other concerning area of AI assistants like Grok being accessible through social media platforms is their delivery of information in public — unlike ChatGPT or other chatbots being used privately. Even if a user is well aware that the information it gets from the assistant could be misleading or not completely correct, others on the platform might still believe it. This could cause serious social harms. Instances of that were seen earlier in India when misinformation circulated over WhatsApp led to mob lynchings. However, those severe incidents occurred before the arrival of generative AI, which has made synthetic content generation even easier and appear more realistic. “If you see a lot of these Grok answers, you’re going to say, hey, well, most of them are right, and that may be so, but there are going to be some that are wrong. And how many? It’s not a small fraction. Some of the research studies have shown that AI models are subject to 20% error rates … and when it goes wrong, it can go really wrong with real-world consequences,” IFCN’s Holan told TechCrunch. While AI companies, including xAI, are refining their AI models to make them communicate more like humans, they still are not — and cannot — replace humans. For the last few months, tech companies are exploring ways to reduce reliance on human fact-checkers. Platforms, including X and Meta, started embracing the new concept of crowdsourced fact-checking through Community Notes. Naturally, such changes also cause concern to fact-checkers. Sinha of Alt News optimistically believes that people will learn to differentiate between machines and human fact-checkers and will value the accuracy of the humans more. “We’re going to see the pendulum swing back eventually toward more fact-checking,” IFCN’s Holan said. However, she noted that in the meantime, fact-checkers will likely have more work to do with the AI-generated information spreading swiftly. “A lot of this issue depends on, do you really care about what is actually true or not? Are you just looking for the veneer of something that sounds and feels true without actually being true? Because that’s what AI assistance will get you,” she said.

    "content": "Elon Musk is hyping the imminent release of his ChatGPT competitor Grok, yet another example of how his entire personality is just itself a biological LLM made by ingesting all of Reddit and 4chan. Grok already seems patterned in many ways off of the worst of Elon’s indulgences, with the sense of humor of a desperately unfunny and regressive internet troll, and biases informed by a man whose horrible, dangerous biases are fully invisible to himself. There are all kinds of reasons to be wary of Grok, including the standard reasons to be wary of any current LLM-based AI technology, like hallucinations and inaccuracies. Layer on Elon Musk’s recent track record for disastrous social sensitivity and generally harmful approach to world-shaping issues, and we’re already looking at even more reason for concern. But the real risk probably isn’t yet so easy to grok, just because we have little understanding yet of the extent of the impact that widespread use of LLMs across our daily and online lives will have. One key area where they’re already having and are bound to have much more of an impact is user-generated content. We’ve seen companies already deploying first-party integrations that start to embrace some of these uses, like Artifact with its AI-generated thumbnails for shared posts, and Meta adding chatbots to basically everything. Musk is debuting Grok on X as a feature reserved for Premium+ subscribers initially, with a rollout supposedly beginning this week. Clearly, Musk aims to dangle Grok as a carrot to attract more subscribers to his more expensive subscription tier for dumpster fire X. X will also inform Grok, which is its own cause for concern, given how far the network has fallen in terms of being a source of reliable info even from its not particularly stellar days as Twitter. The real threat isn’t even a woefully misinformation-laden chatbot deployed at scale on a network that was once roundly criticized by its current owner for being rife with bots; no, the real danger is what happens if Musk’s AI mini-me starts to drown out the rest of the discourse — and what happens if other moneyed megalomaniacs see it working out for him. Musk’s special ability as it stands is a sycophantic following with a willingness to accept his interpretation of reality, no matter how twisted or demonstrably untrue. But that’s nothing compared to an LLM trained on basically the same drivel, capable of not only parroting but also generating highly accurate novel “opinions” and “perspectives” made from the clay of their maker, and then of spreading them quickly with unfettered access to a network that still spans tens of millions of influential users. The only advantage that the many, many people who aren’t billionaires currently have over those that are is their very abundance — the masses are the masses because of, well, their mass. Despite what I’m sure are many clandestine offshore attempts to clone billionaires as an answer to this sticky math problem, it remains somewhat intractable. Yet the advent of LLM-based chatbots threatens to destabilize the very notion of popular opinion, by drowning out the voices of real users with countless artificial ones that are nigh-indistinguishable from authentic human beings. We’ve already seen the demagogues of late-stage capitalism try to claim a “populist” perspective that has no footing in actually being the will of the people. So far, though, they’ve mostly done that via bald-faced braggadocio; within a few iterations of the coming onslaught of LLM-powered chatbots, they could have the artificial, but convincing, numbers to back up their malign interpretations of the world.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted Tuesday evening that the company is “scouting” locations to build a new U.S. gigafactory that will produce the Cybertruck and Model Y crossover. “Scouting locations for Cybertruck Gigafactory. Will be central USA,” Musk tweeted Tuesday. He added that the factory would be used to produce Model Y crossovers for the East Coast market. The first Model Y vehicles are being produced at its plant in Fremont, Calif. Scouting locations for Cybertruck Gigafactory. Will be central USA. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 11, 2020 Musk didn’t provide further information in the tweets. However, a source with knowledge of the talks said Nashville is on a short list of contenders. Tennessee is already shaping up to be a hub of electric vehicle production. Volkswagen is spending $800 million to expand its U.S. factory in Chattanooga, Tenn. and turn it into the company’s North American base for manufacturing electric vehicles. Electric vehicle production at the Tennessee site will begin in 2022, VW said at the time. Meanwhile, Nissan has been producing the Nissan Leaf in Smyrna since 2013. Tesla assembles its Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles in Fremont, Calif. at a factory that was once home to GM and Toyota’s New United Motor Manufacturing Inc (NUMMI) operation. Tesla acquired the factory in 2010. The first Model S was produced at the factory in June 2012. Tesla turned its efforts to battery production and in June 2014 broke ground on its first “gigafactory” on land near Reno, Nevada. The massive structure, which has surpassed. 1.9 million square feet, is where Tesla produces battery packs and electric motors for its Model 3 vehicles. The company has a joint venture with Panasonic, which is making the lithium-ion cells. Tesla also has a “Gigafactory 2” in Buffalo, New York, where it’s producing solar cells and modules. In 2018, Tesla struck a deal with the Chinese government to build a factory in Shanghai, a milestone for Musk, who has long viewed China as a crucial market. The China factory started producing the Model 3 late last year. The first deliveries began in early January. Tesla is now clearing land for another factory near Berlin. Once complete, this German factory will produce the Model 3 and Model Y for the European market. The story has been updated to reflect new information about the possible location of the factory.

Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B. Before we dive in, I wanted to highlight one of our latest founder Q&A interviews, which we publish twice a month over at TC+. This time, Rebecca Bellan interviewed Dmitry Shevelenko, the former Uber executive who co-founded Tortoise in 2019. The pair covered a lot of ground, including Tier’s acquisition of Spin, the future of micromobility, how to own changing business directions, the difficulties in sidewalk robot delivery and the agility of startups. As always, you can email me at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com to share thoughts, criticisms, opinions or tips. You also can send a direct message on — @kirstenkorosec. As Gogoro gears up to go public via SPAC with Poema Global this quarter, the company filed a prospectus with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, from which we can glean some interesting little nuggets of information about the company. For example, the shareholder meeting to approve the merger is scheduled 9:30 a.m. ET on March 31, 2022. Gogoro expects to make $550 million when it goes public, which includes an oversubscribed PIPE (private investment in public equity) of $285 million and $345 million held in trust by Poema Global. The company will use the funds to expand further into China, India and Southeast Asia. The company’s prospectus details much of the Taiwanese company’s concerns regarding its dealings with China. “Changes in the policies, regulations, rules, and the enforcement of laws of the PRC government may be quick with little advance notice and could have a significant impact upon Gogoro’s ability to operate profitably in the PRC,” the filing said. “The business, financial condition and results of operations of Gogoro, and/or the value of Gogoro’s securities or its ability to offer … securities to investors may be materially and adversely affected to the extent the PRC government intervenes or influences Gogoro’s operations.” The risk factors go on to detail how Gogoro’s operations may be subject to a variety of PRC laws regarding cybersecurity and data protection, which might result in Gogoro spending additional resources and incurring time delays to complete the business combination or be prevented from pursuing certain investment opportunities. Berlin-based e-bike subscription startup Dance is expanding to Hamburg, Munich, Vienna and Paris, giving customers an e-bike for €79/month. It’s also acquiring moped subscription startup Rollich. Super73 released a ton of new e-bike models, including its first electric motorcycle, at SXSW. The motorcycle is just a concept vehicle, but the other models include an a-bike for kids. Get ’em while they’re young. Audi of America partnered with Spoke, a mobility platform for safety, Qualcomm and Commsignia to bring the benefits of cellular vehicle-to-everything tech to enhance safety for motor vehicles and bicycles. With its partners, Audi is developing hardware and software for cars to help them read their surroundings to identify nearby bicycles. Remember about six weeks ago when autonomous vehicle company Cruise unlocked a $1.35 billion investment from Softbank Vision Fund after launching a limited driverless robotaxi service to the public in San Francisco? Welp, General Motors now owns a helluva a lot more of the company. GM said late Friday it is buying Softbank Vision Fund 1’s equity ownership in Cruise for $2.1 billion. GM said it’s also making an additional $1.35 billion investment in Cruise, replacing a previous commitment made by the fund in 2018. GM acquired Cruise back in 2016. Within a couple of years, GM expanded the circle a bit, bringing in investment from Softbank as well as $2.75 billion from Honda as part of an exclusive agreement to develop and produce a new kind of autonomous vehicle. The pool of investors would grow again with T.Rowe Price & Associates and, more recently, Microsoft. It’s unclear who prompted the buyback. Was Softbank unhappy with progress and looking to claw back some of its investment, or was this driven by GM? Or perhaps a combination. It seems, from at least where I sit, GM is laying a foundation for a future spin out and even an IPO for its subsidiary. Other deals that got my attention … EO Charging, the British EV charging company, ended its merger agreement with First Reserve Sustainable Growth Corp. Flash, the cloud parking software startup, nabbed a more than $250 million strategic investment from Vista Equity Partners, money that it will use to expand its mobility operating system and payments platform and invest into new talent. Getir, the instant delivery startup, closed a new $768 million Series E funding round led by Mubadala Investment Company, with Abu Dhabi Growth Fund (ADG), Alpha Wave Global, Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global also participating. Following this deal, the company reached a valuation of $11.8 billion. GoTo Group, the Indonesian tech firm that formed last year via a merger between ride-hailing giant Gojek and marketplace Tokopedia, plans to raise at least $1.1 billion from an initial public offering scheduled for April 4. The company said it aims to sell up to 52 billion new Series A shares at between 316 rupiah and 346 rupiah apiece, raising $28.8 billion at the top end of the range. Moove, an African mobility fintech startup that provides vehicle financing to drivers of ride-hailing platforms like Uber and other gig networks, raised $105 million in a new Series A2 round led by Speedinvest and Left Lane Capital. Existing investor thelatest.ventures also participated, alongside new backers such as AfricInvest, MUFG Innovation Partners, Latitude and Kreos Capital participated. Shift, the used car e-commerce platform, acquired some of competitor Fair Technologies’ technology, allowing Shift to become the Amazon of the used car marketplace, a platform that displays third-party listings from dealers alongside the company’s own inventory. TuSimple, the autonomous vehicle company that is backed by Chinese social media firm Sina Corp, is evaluating whether to sell its business in China and only operate in the U.S after reaching an agreement with the U.S. government to restrict its data due to U.S. security concerns. Whale Dynamic, a Shenzhen-based autonomous delivery startup founded by Baidu veteran David Chang, said it has closed a seed round of about $2.5 million. Qianchuang Capital, a Beijing-based investment firm managed by veterans from China’s leading financial institutions, led the round, with participation from Shangbang Huizhong, a Chinese fund backed by real estate developers. Zomato, the food delivery firm, and instant delivery service Blinkit have reached an agreement for a merger, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The all-stock deal values Blinkit between $700 million and $750 million, the source said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private. Argo AI has released Argoverse 2, the second version of its collection of open-source autonomous driving data and high-def maps from Austin, Detroit, Miami, Pittsburgh, Palo Alto, and Washington, D.C. The company is also sharing a lidar dataset to fuel research into new methods of ML using unlabeled point cloud data. Aurora built a transferable hardware kit that will help it develop autonomous trucks and cars in parallel, as well as power those vehicles with its Aurora Driver. Solo Advanced Vehicle Technologies wants to build electric, purpose-built heavy-duty truck platforms for autonomous freight. Ford said it will launch three new electric passenger vehicles and four new electric commercial vehicles in Europe over the next two years, an acceleration of its plans to sell more EVs in the region on its way toward reaching carbon neutrality in the region by 2035. Side note: Ford’s Advanced Manufacturing Center has developed a patent-pending system that solves a bottleneck in the production line by using robots to operate the 3D printers through the night without human interaction. Maserati plans to launch a battery-electric version for each model in its portfolio by 2025 and phase out gas engines by the end of the decade, making it the latest to join the long list of marques from Aston Martin to Volvo that has pledged to go electric. Porsche provided an update on its strategy during its annual meeting, a plan that will now include producing an all-electric 718 followed by a Macan EV as well as building out its own proprietary global network of charging stations next year, a departure from its initial strategy to rely on partnerships with other companies. Stellantis and LG Energy Solution will build their new EV battery plant in Ontario, Canada. Tesla idled its Shanghai Gigafactory for two days amid a rise in China’s Omicron cases that has prompted the government to tighten restrictions there. The automaker sent a notice to employees and suppliers on Wednesday informing them of the closure, reported Reuters, which viewed the internal memo. Volta, the EV charging company, is working with Tanger Factory Outlet Centers to install charging stations at Tanger locations in nine markets in the U.S., with expectations to grow in the coming months. Lyft and Uber are adding temporary fuel surcharges to fares for ride-hail and deliveries as fuel prices around the country rise. The rising prices are due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has resulted in a mountain of economic sanctions from the west against Russia, including the U.S.’s ban last week of Russian oil imports and the U.K.’s promise to ease its dependency on Russian fuel by the end of the year. The Biden administration awarded $409 million in grants to 70 projects in 39 states to modernize and electrify America’s buses and improve safety. Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley’s total compensation skyrocketed 93% to $22.8 million in 2021, an increase largely due to stock awards, which more than tripled to about $16 million, according to the company’s annual proxy statement. Farley’s pay included a $1.7 million base salary, a 19% increase from 2020. His compensation also included $830,305 for personal use of aircraft.

    "content": "2022 was the kind of year that made us think, “What a time to be alive and reporting on transportation.” This year was absolutely dominated by conversations around the realities of bringing self-driving cars to market, the potential upheaval of the gig worker economy, micromobility dramas and, of course, all things Tesla. We took a look back at our top-performing transportation stories to determine what stood out as important to you, our dear readers. Autonomous vehicle startup Argo AI came onto the scene in 2017 with a $1 billion investment. Today, the company is no more after Ford and Volkswagen pulled out their investments. This one shocked the AV world, in particular because Argo had been in the middle of running a robotaxi pilot with Lyft in Austin and testing fully driverless technology in Miami. The shutdown of the company signaled two things: (1) Another round of consolidation is coming for self-driving tech companies and (2) Deploying Level 4 self-driving technology at scale is still far away. Both Ford and VW decided to put their investments toward more near-term paths to profitability, specifically Level 2 and Level 3 autonomy, or advanced driver assistance systems. Jim Farley, Ford’s CEO, also said he didn’t think the automaker would need to develop L4 technology itself but could instead outsource it down the line. It’s the transportation mystery of the year. What happened to Bolt Mobility, the Miami-based micromobility startup co-founded by Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt? Back in August, we reported that the company up and vanished from several of its U.S. markets, leaving cities with abandoned equipment, unanswered calls and emails and lots of questions. It also left at least one city, Portland, with outstanding fees. No one — not TechCrunch nor many city officials — was able to get in contact with the company to ask what happened and what it planned to do with all the gear the company left on the ground. The company appears to have shut down — it hasn’t been active on social media since July — despite having been on a growth streak the year prior. Bolt started out 2021 by acquiring the assets of Last Mile Holdings, which opened up 48 new markets to the startup. It just goes to show, micromobility is a tough game to win, even if it looks like the odds are in your favor. If anyone has any information about Bolt Mobility, I’m still dying to know what went down there. Because who doesn’t love a roundup? In April at the New York Auto Show, automakers legacy and startup came together to show off their electric vehicle offerings. Here are the ones that got our attention this year: A day before Tesla opened its Berlin gigafactory in March, CEO Elon Musk teased the release of Tesla’s “Master Plan Part 3,” which leans heavily on themes of artificial intelligence and scaling operations to “extreme size.” “Main Tesla subjects will be scaling to extreme size, which is needed to shift humanity away from fossil fuels, and AI,” Musk tweeted at the time. “But I will also include sections about SpaceX, Tesla and The Boring Company.” Part 3 of Tesla’s master plan is the first to include mention of Musk’s other companies. Note: This was published before Musk bought out Twitter. A quick refresher on parts one and two. Part one was published in a 2006 blog post that outlined Tesla’s proof of concept and involved building a sports car and using the funds to build more affordable cars, while simultaneously providing zero-emission electric power generation. Part two, which came out a decade later, discussed plans to develop battery storage and launch new models, including a pickup truck and SUV. Later in the year, Musk revealed more details about his Master Plan part three. Per a companywide meeting, the plan’s raison d’etre is: “How do you get to enough scale to actually shift the entire energy infrastructure of earth?” Russia’s war in Ukraine caused gas prices to skyrocket globally earlier this year. In March, at the start of the war, Uber and Lyft responded by adding temporary fuel surcharges to rider fares to help drivers cover the rising cost of fuel. The Rideshare Guy, a blog and podcast dedicated to helping ride-share drivers earn more money and stay up to date with industry news, polled its community of Uber and Lyft drivers in the U.S. and found that 43% quit or were driving less due to high gas prices. Before the fuel surcharges were announced, that number was at 53%. Many drivers said the surcharge wasn’t enough and they’d have liked to see a per-mile surcharge to account for the increased fuel expenditure on long trips rather than a flat fee. One Lyft driver told TechCrunch the surcharge is “an insult to drivers.” This article is important today because it encapsulates many themes — our ability as a species to panic the moment prices for hot commodities increase; the ongoing aggravation of gig workers; the subtle dance Uber and Lyft play as they try to appease drivers but seemingly never in a way that’s actually meaningful. Another big story this year was the Department of Labor’s proposed ruling on gig worker status, and the subsequent tanking of app-based companies’ stock prices. The rule, if passed, will make it easier for gig workers to claim employment status if they can prove they’re financially dependent on a company. Drivers who feel they’ve not only been consistently shafted by macroeconomic events but also barely protected by Uber and Lyft might be praying for real change on a federal level.

    "content": "While onstage at Tesla’s annual shareholder event, CEO Elon Musk hinted that the automaker would choose the location for a new gigafactory by the end of the year. Musk jokingly asked his fans where the company should build, and when a few yelled out “Canada!” Musk replied, “I’m half Canadian. Maybe I should.” It seemed like a throwaway comment at the time, but a July lobbyist registration from Tesla reveals the company might actually have its eyes set on the U.S.’s neighbor to the north. Tesla recently added an amendment to its registration with Ontario’s Office of the Integrity Commissioner that sets forth the automaker’s plans to engage with the Ontario government to identify opportunities for “industrial and/or advanced manufacturing facility.” To sweeten the deal, Tesla’s lobbyists propose such a facility could “increase the competitiveness of Ontario and its ability to attract capital investment.” Tesla did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s requests for comment. Ontario may not need much of a push to welcome a Tesla gigafactory into its lands. The region already has a thriving automotive ecosystem that plays off its neighbor Detroit. Ford and General Motors already have existing plants there. In fact, in April, the Canadian government invested about $415 million into GM’s two new plants in Ontario, including one that will produce electric vehicles. “By making Ontario a competitive business environment, including reducing the cost of doing business by $7 billion annually, we have attracted nearly $16 billion in electric vehicle investments in the last 20 months,” Vic Fedeli, minister of Ontario’s economic development, job creation and trade, said in a statement shared with TechCrunch. “We are building an end-to-end supply chain right here in Ontario, and expect to continue to see more companies from around the world looking to our province as a place to invest and grow.” Musk said during the shareholder meeting last week that Tesla could ultimately have 10 to 12 gigafactories globally. Even though Tesla has opened gigafactories in Berlin and Shanghai, the U.S. still makes up for the vast majority of Tesla vehicle sales globally, so it makes sense the company might choose another North American location for its next factory — especially considering the headaches the Shanghai factory has endured, what with consistent lockdowns and factory line updates causing vehicle sales in China to fall. It’s possible that Tesla is rushing to find locations to build batteries and vehicles closer to home after the Inflation Reduction Act was approved on Sunday by the U.S. Senate. The $430 billion bill could restrict automakers from using Chinese-made materials and require them to use North American-sourced battery components if they want to be eligible for consumer tax credits for EV purchases.

    "content": "Tesla’s battery day is here after months of tweets and teasers from the company’s CEO Elon Musk. And while the battery day portion will certainly provide plenty of news and insights into Tesla, there is another company-related activity that promises the same. The Tesla event, which begins at 1:30 p.m. PT September 22, kicks off with its annual shareholder meeting followed by the battery day activities. That’s today. Readers can watch the live stream here. Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting — like its earnings call — tends to be packed with announcements and updates and general ruminating and forecasting from Musk. Expect questions and hopefully answers about Tesla’s various construction projects around the world, including new factories in Austin, Texas and Berlin, as well as the expansion in Shanghai. Whether Musk provides an update on the Roadster and Tesla Semi is unclear. However, at least one tweet from Musk hints that the two products will come up during the Battery Day section of activities today. Musk noted that what is revealed today during Battery Day will affect long-term production, especially its Class 8 truck, the Tesla Semi, as well as its Roadster sports car and Cybertruck. “What we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022,” he wrote. Important note about Tesla Battery Day unveil tomorrow. This affects long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck & Roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 21, 2020 What many in the industry expect Tesla to announce is that it’s manufacturing its own battery cells, likely setting up production within the confines of its new factories as it continues to vertically integrate. Tesla’s $218 million acquisition of Maxwell Technologies in 2018 triggered speculation that the company was interested in developing and even manufacturing its own battery cells. Actions taken by the company in the past two years seem to support this. However, Tesla’s interest in developing better batteries was piqued long before it acquired Maxwell. In 2015, Tesla signed a five-year exclusive partnership with Jeff Dahn, a leading lithium-ion battery researcher and professor at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. The exclusive partnership with Tesla began in June 2016, after Dahn completed a project funded by 3M and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to develop longer-lasting, lower-cost lithium-ion battery cells. Expect the fruits of that partnership — which has produced a steady stream of patent applications — to be described in more detail today. Panasonic is Tesla’s primary battery cell supplier. The company has a joint venture with Tesla, manufacturing cells at the so-called Gigafactory in Sparks, Nevada. The initial plan was for the Gigafactory to produce 35 gigawatt hours of battery capacity, a goal it has reached. Now, Panasonic is adding another production line, an expansion that will increase battery cell capacity by 10%. The Gigafactory has been the centerpiece of Tesla’s plan to expand global battery capacity and reduce the cost of electric vehicles. Panasonic has been its most important partner in that project, which, based on a recent agreement, should last until at least 2023. That doesn’t mean Tesla hasn’t been dedicated to developing its own battery technology. Musk tweeted Monday that the company intends “to increase, not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic, LG & CATL (possibly other partners too). However, even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed, we still foresee significant shortages in 2022 and beyond unless we also take action ourselves.” We intend to increase, not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic, LG & CATL (possibly other partners too). However, even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed, we still foresee significant shortages in 2022 & beyond unless we also take action ourselves. And there’s plenty of evidence suggesting that the company has been working in earnest on its own batteries. In August 2019, Tesla received a permit from the Bay Area Air Quality District to operate a pilot battery manufacturing line at a facility in Fremont, California, near its vehicle assembly factory. The facility on Kato Road also had an application for what appears to be a more permanent permit, but it remains incomplete for data, which means the company never submitted all the necessary data for regulators to review. However, the air quality district has since issued two new permits, one for cathode coating and another simply described as “trade secret,” for the same Kato facility that has been tied to Tesla’s battery development in the past.

    "content": "SpaceX private spaceflight ambitions got a big boost in 2018 when Japanese entrepreneur and billionaire Yusaku Maezawa announced he’d be taking a trip aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon on a round-trip flight passing the moon. Maezawa is still on track to make that trip by 2023, according to current schedules, but he’s so eager to get to space that he just announced he’ll make a visit to the International Space Station as a private astronaut this December. Maezawa will go as a client of Space Adventures, on a Russian Soyuz rocket set to take off from Kazakhstan on December 8, and he’ll be accompanied by his production assistant Yozo Hirano. Space Adventures is the same company behind prior Soyuz commercial spaceflight missions, including the trip made by Anousheh Ansari in 2006 and Guy Laliberté in 2009, among others. Laliberté’s trip was the most recent, with space tourism at the station officially on hold since the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011 since Soyuz has been the only means to access the ISS. Now that SpaceX is flying regular astronaut shuttle missions, however, tourist trips are back on. SpaceX’s first paying moon flight customer wants to give away eight seats aboard his spaceship The trip that Maezawa plans to take will take place over the course of 12 days, and he’ll be doing three months of training in Russia to get ready for the experience. In addition to being the first private astronaut visit to the ISS in more than 10 years, this is also the first time that two private astronauts will fly onboard the same Soyuz at the same time. Maezawa and Hirano will also be the first Japanese citizens to make the journey as private individuals. It may seem like overkill to get to visit space twice in a lifetime as a private astronaut, but Maezawa says he’s driven by a curiosity of “what’s life like in space?” which will of course be useful information to have on the planned moon mission, which will spend three days getting there, make a loop around our natural satellite, and then spend three days coming back. He’s also planning to post the experience to YouTube, which is why Hirano is accompanying him to document the trip.

    "content": "Sunita “Suni” Williams and Barry “Butch” Wilmore have returned to Earth after a nine-month stay on the International Space Station (ISS) — a trip that lasted far longer than originally planned thanks to leaks and thruster problems on the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they used to get there. Williams and Wilmore splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico in a SpaceX Dragon capsule at 5:57 p.m. ET on Tuesday, after a 17-hour return journey from the ISS. Their return marks the end of one of the stranger chapters in recent spaceflight history, thanks to the problems that Boeing’s Starliner experienced and the way that SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has politicized the astronauts’ return. Williams and Wilmore initially launched to the ISS in June 2024 as part of a mission that was crucial to Boeing’s attempt to compete with SpaceX. The aviation behemoth won a contract alongside SpaceX in 2014 to send astronauts to the ISS for NASA with an eye on eventually carrying them even farther out into the solar system. SpaceX performed its first crewed flight with its Crew Dragon spacecraft in 2020 — during the early days of the COVID pandemic. Boeing’s Starliner project, meanwhile, was dragged down by cost overruns and delays. The flight in June 2024 was supposed to help Boeing look past all that. The goal was to send Williams and Wilmore to the ISS and then bring them back home after a short stay. But Starliner experienced problems before they even docked with the ISS. Once the astronauts finally got aboard, NASA and Boeing spent a few weeks performing tests before deciding to bring Starliner back without them. NASA quickly started working with SpaceX on a plan to bring Willams and Wilmore back. After some back-and-forth, they decided to wait until early 2025 to bring the duo home so that the ISS wouldn’t be short-staffed. In recent months, though, Musk has claimed (without providing any evidence) that he offered to bring the astronauts home earlier — and that former president Joe Biden declined the offer because it would help his political rival Donald Trump. NASA’s former administrator and deputy administrator under Biden have both said the space agency was not aware of any offer. CNN reported on Tuesday that senior White House officials also claim they weren’t aware of any offer.

    "content": "SpaceX has launched another 60 Starlink satellites — making 180 delivered to orbit in under two weeks — but the launch early Sunday morning was more notable because it set a new, key record for Falcon 9 rocket reusability. This marked the 10th flight of the first-stage rocket booster used for the launch, which sets a record for reuse for SpaceX as the rocket booster with the most successful mission under its belt. The launch took place at 2:42 a.m. EDT, flying from Cape Canaveral in Florida. SpaceX also successfully returned the booster to its drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean for a tenth successful landing for the rocket, too, making it a record-setter in that regard as well, and setting up the possibility that it could fly yet again. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said it could be “possible” for a Falcon 9 booster to fly “100+” times with servicing and component replacement. This Falcon 9 has previously flown on missions including the original uncrewed demonstration mission of Crew Dragon, SpaceX’s astronaut spacecraft, and seven prior Starlink launches. SpaceX has shown just how reusable its rockets are with its aggressive Starlink launch schedule, most of which have employed rocket boosters that have flown a number of missions before, including other launches for the broadband internet megaconstellation. Since SpaceX is both launch provider and customer on Starlink, it’s actually crucial for the company to realize as many cost savings as possible during its frequent flights building the network of low-Earth orbit satellites. Reuse of the boosters is a key ingredient, and one where the cost savings definitely accrue over time. Musk has previously said that the economics are such that for its external customer flights, it’s at about “even” on the second use of a booster, and “ahead” in terms of costs by the third. During its Starlink launch program, SpaceX has repeatedly set and broken its own reusability records, indicating a key means of keeping the costs of building out its in-space satellite infrastructure is using flight-proven boosters as much as possible. This is the 27th Starlink launch thus far, and SpaceX has another planned just six days from now on May 15, with at least one more likely in the works for later this month after that. The company hopes to have its broadband network built out to the point where it has global reach by the end of this year.

    "content": "We now know the names of all four individuals who will fly on the historic Inspiration4 mission, the first all-civilian spaceflight in history. In addition to previously revealed crew members Jared Isaacman (who’s footing the entire bill) and St. Jude Children’s Hospital employee Haley Arceneaux, Inspiration4 will include Dr. Sian Proctor and Christopher Sembroski as the final two civilian astronauts. The mission will use a SpaceX Dragon capsule and is set to fly no earlier than September 15, with a total duration of three days. Dr. Proctor takes the seat reserved for the online business competition portion of the crew selection process, which saw entrants taken from submissions based on people who had created businesses on Isaacman’s Shift4Shop e-commerce platform. Sembroski won his seat by contributing to the ongoing St. Jude fundraising drive Isaacman is hosting as part of the mission’s promotional campaign. Both Proctor and Sembroski have specific sets of skills relative to spaceflight that seem likely to have factored into their selection for the crew. Proctor is a trained pilot, for instance, and Sembroski is a veteran aerospace employee, most recently at Lockheed Martin, and also a literal veteran, having served in the U.S. Air Force. As part of this final crew reveal, Inspiration4 also shared how many entries it received in each category. Somewhat surprisingly, the Shift4Shop e-commerce platform competition only drew a total of “approximately” 200 entries — and use of “approximately” suggests fewer — while the charity drive drew 72,000 entries, and has raised around $113 million to date. That’s still short of the campaign’s $200 million goal, and includes Isaacman’s personal commitment of $100 million, but the drive continues and there are additional awards to be won, even if the top prize of the trip to space is gone. Despite economic downturn, space startup funding defies gravity This whole mission campaign has honestly been one of the most bizarre stories in spaceflight in recent memory, beginning with the big announcement, which included a press conference with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk joining Isaacman to discuss the flight, and seemingly not being aware of any relevant details about mission specifics. Isaacman also dedicated $100 million of his own money to the charity drive for St. Jude, as mentioned, but clearly donations from the community aren’t living up to expectations, with around 13% of the total target raised to date. That “approximately 200” entries in the Shift4Shop build-a-business competition might be the most perplexing, since the award was a free trip to space. In retrospect, this seems like it was the path to space with the most likelihood of working out, even if you had to convince an oddly cast panel of judges to select you as the winner.

    "content": "SpaceX has launched another batch of Starlink satellites, adding 60 more to the constellation on orbit. This is the 24th Starlink launch in total, and means SpaceX has now sent up more than 1,500 Starlink spacecraft, with around 1,438 of those still in operation. This is the first Starlink launch since April 7 — which, surprisingly, is the biggest gap between these launches in quite a while. This year, SpaceX’s overall launch calendar has been dominated by Starlink launches, as the company seeks to expand the availability, quality and coverage of its low Earth orbit broadband internet network. SpaceX also opened up availability of Starlink service this year, and now seems to be mostly supply-constrained on the consumer receiver terminal side, rather than necessarily on network capacity or regional ability. Regarding that few week gap in the Starlink launch pace, it’s not like SpaceX was slacking in the meantime; the launcher sent up its second crew of astronauts destined for the International Space Station in a flight just last week. Plus, it has two or three additional Starlink launches tentatively scheduled to happen in May. SpaceX successfully launches astronauts with a re-used Dragon spacecraft for the first time This latest launch took off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 11:44 PM EDT (8:44 PM PDT) on Wednesday, and used a flight-proven Falcon 9 first-stage booster, which was used on six prior missions, including four Starlink launches.

    "content": "Inspiration4 is getting its own documentary. Netflix said Tuesday it would be releasing a five-part series on the mission, its first documentary to cover an event “in near real-time,” in five parts in September. “Countdown: Inspiration4 Mission to Space” will follow the first all-civilian Inspiration4 crew as they prepare for and undergo a three-day flight to low Earth orbit. The private flight is being funded by — surprise! — a billionaire: Jared Isaacman, the CEO and founder of payment processor Shift4 Payments. He will be joined by Hayley Arceneaux, a physician assistant at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital and a pediatric bone cancer survivor; Christopher Sembroski, a Lockheed Martin engineer and Air Force veteran; and professor of geoscience Sian Proctor. Isaacman has committed to donating $100 million to St. Jude’s out of his own funds, in addition to the public donation drive that was used to select Sian Proctor’s seat. As of March, the donation drive raised an additional $13 million for the children’s hospital. SpaceX is aiming to fly the first all-civilian human space mission by the end of 2021 The crew will travel to orbit in a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft and a Falcon 9 rocket. The launch giant is customizing the Dragon especially for the mission, replacing a docking mechanism with a transparent glass dome out of which crewmembers will be able to take in what will likely be some pretty spectacular views. The dome will only be large enough to fit one passenger at a time, and it’ll only open once the spacecraft has safely exited Earth’s atmosphere. (Stellar views are a relatively recent concern for launch developers and space passengers, mostly an effect of the burgeoning space tourism industry.) The Netflix series will likely be the cherry on top of the massive media event that will be Inspiration4. The Netflix series will be directed by Jason Hehir, who previously headed “The Last Dance,” an ESPN documentary miniseries about Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. This September, four civilians will launch into space for a three-day trip orbiting Earth.

    "content": "SpaceX is set to make a change to its Crew Dragon spacecraft for its forthcoming history-making all-civilian launch, currently set for September 15. That Dragon will replace its International Space Station docking mechanism with a transparent dome, through which passengers will be able to take in an awe-inspiring panorama of space and the Earth from an orbital perspective. The glass dome will be at the “nose” of the Dragon capsule, or its topmost point when it’s loaded upright on top of a Falcon 9 rocket readying for launch. There should be space for one passenger to use it at a time, and it’ll be opened up once the spacecraft is safely out of Earth’s atmosphere, exposed by a protective cover that can be flipped back down to protect the observation deck when the spacecraft re-enters on its return trip. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk called it “the most ‘in space’ you could possibly feel” in a tweet sharing a concept render of the new modification in use. During a press briefing for the upcoming tourist flight, which is called “Inspiration4” and led by billionaire Jared Isaacman, it was described as being similar to the exiting cupola on the International Space Station in terms of the views it affords. SpaceX alumni are helping build LA’s startup ecosystem Probably most “in space” you could possibly feel by being in a glass dome https://t.co/SOAIzxVGgX — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 30, 2021 The ISS cupola is an observatory module built by the European Space Agency (ESA) and installed in 2010. Based on these renders from SpaceX, the Dragon version will be a continuous unbroken transparent surface, whereas the ISS cupola is made up of segmented panes separated by support structure, so that could mean Dragon provides a better view. This modification could pave the way for a more permanent alternate configuration of Dragon, one best-suited for SpaceX’s planned commercial passenger missions, most of which will likely aim to do orbital tours without any actual docking at the ISS. It’s possible the company will make further cabin modifications when the vehicle isn’t configured for crew delivery to the orbital science station. SpaceX also revealed new details about the Inspiration4 mission today, including its planned launch date of September 15, and a three-day mission flight duration.

    "content": "Tesla over the weekend said its first much anticipated Cybertruck came off the electric vehicle maker’s production line in Texas. The debut of the long-delayed, futuristic-looking pickup truck comes in the lead up to Tesla’s second-quarter 2023 earnings call. Tesla CEO Elon Musk first introduced the Cybertruck in 2019, but vehicle production has repeatedly been delayed. The truck was initially scheduled for production and delivery in 2021, but Tesla has pushed back the timing since then, citing shortages in sourcing components. In July 2022, Musk set a new production schedule for summer 2023. During Tesla’s first-quarter 2023 earnings call, the executive also promised to host a delivery event for the Cybertruck toward the end of Q3. Musk said at Tesla’s 2023 annual shareholder’s meeting in May that the automaker could deliver between 250,000 to 500,000 units per year once production begins. Mass production is scheduled for the end of this year. Analysts will be on the lookout Wednesday during the automaker’s Q2 earnings call for firmer details on production, delivery and specs. While Tesla has attributed Cybertruck delays to standard supply chain issues, leaked documents have revealed other fundamental flaws in the vehicle’s basic design and engineering. In January 2022, a whistleblower leaked 100GB of files to German outlet Handelsblatt that showed preproduction prototypes had serious braking, powertrain, suspension, sealing and structural issues. The report, which detailed unfulfilled promises from Tesla, reminded many of the first Cybertruck reveal event, when the vehicle’s designer cracked the supposedly unbreakable armor glass windows. As of November 2022, the Cybertruck had more than 1.5 million reservations, according to a report from Electrek. Tesla customers have been able to put down a $100 refundable deposit to preorder since 2019. Tesla originally estimated the truck would start at $39,900 for the single-motor and rear-wheel drive model, which would have a towing capacity of 7,500 pounds and more than 250 miles of range. That model is now expected to start at about $50,000, according to Kelley Blue Book. The dual-motor, all-wheel drive version could start at around $60,000, and it should have a towing capacity of more than 10,000 pounds and over 300 miles of range. The priciest version, starting at around $70,000, will have three electric motors and all-wheel drive, a towing capacity of 14,000 pounds and battery range of over 500 miles. Tesla usually changes prices in the middle of a model year, so these prices may shift again before the end of 2023. Cybertruck buyers may be eligible for the U.S.’s $7,500 federal EV tax incentives. Tesla’s pickup truck launch will bring the automaker into another profitable EV segment in the U.S. The Cybertruck will have to compete with electric pickups like Ford’s F-150 Lightning, which is available now with a starting price of around $60,000. Other upcoming pickups include the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the Rivian R1T. The Silverado EV Work Truck starts at $77,905 and can go 450 miles on a charge. Delivery is expected in the fall of 2023. The Rivian starts at $74,000, with deliveries for certain trims starting this summer.

    "content": "Elon Musk unveiled a prototype of Tesla’s Robovan on Thursday night during the company’s We, Robot event in Los Angeles. The Robovan will be an electric, autonomous vehicle roughly the size of a bus, designed for transporting people around high density areas. It will carry up to 20 people at a time and also transport goods, according to Musk. “We’re going to make this, and it’s going to look like that,” said Musk on Thursday night as the Robovan rolled towards center stage. That’s about as much as Musk was willing to say, and we’re not even sure that much is true. Musk didn’t mention how much the Robovan would cost, how Tesla would produce it, or when it will come out. However, it does look pretty cool. The Robovan has a retro-futuristic look – somewhere between a bus from The Jetsons and a toaster from the 1950s. It features silver metallic sides with black details, and strips of light running parallel to the ground along its sides, with doors that slide out from the middle. Inside, there are seats and room to stand, with tinted windows throughout. There is no steering wheel, since it’s autonomous. “One of the things we want to do – and we’ve done this with the Cybertruck – is we want to change the look of the roads,” said Musk. “The future should look like the future,” he said, repeating an old line. It looks similar to other purpose-built robotaxis, like those designed by Zoox and Cruise. Only Tesla’s van is much bigger. In China, WeRide has built a similar Robobus. That said, the Robovan showed on Thursday is only a prototype. Despite what Musk says, there’s no telling what the real thing will look like or when it will actually come out. Tesla had kept the design of the vehicles it introduced on Thursday pretty close to the chest. The only real hint we had was from Tesla’s 2023 Investor Day, when the automaker teased a couple of new vehicles that appeared to be designed for volume production: One smaller vehicle that appears now to be the Cybercab, and a larger one that we can now say is likely the Robovan. The stated goal at the time was to produce 20 million vehicles per year by 2030. That would mean that Tesla needs to increase production and sales by about 15 times from 2022. During Thursday’s event, Musk did not outline any plans for building new production facilities or retooling existing facilities to accommodate either the Cybercab or the Robovan. He also didn’t provide much in the way of timelines for the Robovan, though he predicted the Cybercab would start production in 2026 or 2027. Tesla CEO Elon Musk first floated the idea of launching a robotaxi network using autonomous Teslas in 2019, saying he… Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

CEO Elon Musk posted on social media Wednesday that the Cybertruck delivery event, which traditionally means a few select customers get to take possession of their vehicles, will be held November 30 at the company’s Austin gigafactory. The news of the delivery event comes on the same day that Tesla reported its third-quarter earnings, results that showed a 44% drop in profits from the same period last year. Notably, the Cybertruck delivery date wasn’t included in the earnings report. The report did include a note that pilot production of the Cybertruck has started at Giga Texas, the company’s factory near Austin, Texas. Tesla also said the Cybertruck “remains on track for initial deliveries this year.” Tesla had promised to deliver the Cybertruck to customers in the summer of 2023, and then later, in the third quarter. Both of those deadlines came and went. Tesla hasn’t shared how many Cybertrucks it will put into customers’ hands during the delivery event. Production of the vehicle is expected to ramp in 2024. According to the Q3 earnings report, the gigafactory will have capacity to produce less than 125,000 Cybertrucks once it reaches mass production, a number that Musk said Tesla should hit in 2025. And based on Tesla’s balance sheet, it appears the company is pouring money into Cybertruck production. The EV maker’s operating expenses increased 43% year-over-year to $2.4 billion, due in part to Cybertruck. “I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck,” said Musk during Wednesday’s earnings call, noting that it will take about 18 months until the Cybertruck is cash-flow positive. “I think it is our best product ever. It is going to require immense work to reach volume production and be cashflow positive at a price that people can afford,” continued the executive. “If you want to do something radical and innovative and something really special like the Cybertruck, it is extremely difficult because there’s nothing to copy. You have to invent not just the car, but the way to make the car. So the more uncharted the territory, the less predictable the outcome.” Tesla also said it increased spending on AI development as the company works to get its Dojo supercomputer up and running. Dojo is designed to train Tesla’s neural networks to advance the automaker’s self-driving capabilities, as well as its humanoid robot Optimus.

    "content": "Elon Musk doesn’t want Tesla to be just an automaker. He wants Tesla to be an AI company, one that’s figured out how to make cars drive themselves. Crucial to that mission was Dojo, a custom-built supercomputer designed by Tesla to train its Full Self-Driving (FSD) neural networks. FSD isn’t actually fully self-driving; it can perform some automated driving tasks, but still requires an attentive human behind the wheel. But Tesla thinks with more data, more compute power, and more training, it can cross the threshold from almost self-driving to full self-driving. And that’s where Dojo was supposed to come in. Musk teased Dojo for years and ramped up discussions about the supercomputer throughout 2024. But Dojo is now out, and another supercomputer called Cortex has entered the chat. Below is a timeline of Dojo mentions and promises. Check out this explainer on Dojo for even more information on what it was, why it mattered, and what comes next. April 22 – At Tesla’s Autonomy Day, the automaker had its AI team onstage to talk about Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, and the AI powering them both. The company shares information about Tesla’s custom-built chips that are designed specifically for neural networks and self-driving cars. During the event, Musk teases Dojo, revealing that it’s a supercomputer for training AI. He also notes that all Tesla cars being produced at the time would have all hardware necessary for full self-driving and only needed a software update. Feb 2 – Musk says Tesla will soon have more than a million connected vehicles worldwide with sensors and compute needed for full self-driving — and touts Dojo’s capabilities. “Dojo, our training supercomputer, will be able to process vast amounts of video training data & efficiently run hyperspace arrays with a vast number of parameters, plenty of memory & ultra-high bandwidth between cores. More on this later.” August 14 – Musk reiterates Tesla’s plan to develop a neural network training computer called Dojo “to process truly vast amounts of video data,” calling it “a beast.” He also says the first version of Dojo is “about a year away,” which would put its launch date somewhere around August 2021. December 31 – Elon says Dojo isn’t needed, but it will make self-driving better. “It isn’t enough to be safer than human drivers, Autopilot ultimately needs to be more than 10 times safer than human drivers.” August 19 – The automaker officially announces Dojo at Tesla’s first AI Day, an event meant to attract engineers to Tesla’s AI team. Tesla also introduces its D1 chip, which the automaker says it will use — alongside Nvidia’s GPU — to power the Dojo supercomputer. Tesla notes its AI cluster will house 3,000 D1 chips. October 12 – Tesla releases a Dojo Technology whitepaper, “a guide to Tesla’s configurable floating point formats & arithmetic.” The whitepaper outlines a technical standard for a new type of binary floating-point arithmetic that’s used in deep learning neural networks and can be implemented “entirely in software, entirely in hardware, or in any combination of software and hardware.” August 12 – Musk says Tesla will “phase in Dojo. Won’t need to buy as many incremental GPUs next year.” September 30 – At Tesla’s second AI Day, the company reveals that it has installed the first Dojo cabinet, testing 2.2 megawatts of load testing. Tesla says it was building one tile per day (which is made up of 25 D1 chips). Tesla demos Dojo onstage running a Stable Diffusion model to create an AI-generated image of a “Cybertruck on Mars.” Importantly, the company sets a target date of a full Exapod cluster to be completed by Q1 2023, and says it plans to build a total of seven Exapods in Palo Alto. April 19 – Musk tells investors during Tesla’s first-quarter earnings that Dojo “has the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training,” and also “has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in the same way that Amazon Web Services offers web services.” Musk also notes that he’d “look at Dojo as kind of a long-shot bet,” but a “bet worth making.” June 21 – The Tesla AI X account posts that the company’s neural networks are already in customer vehicles. The thread includes a graph with a timeline of Tesla’s current and projected compute power, which places the start of Dojo production at July 2023, although it’s not clear if this refers to the D1 chips or the supercomputer itself. Musk says that same day that Dojo was already online and running tasks at Tesla data centers. The company also projects that Tesla’s compute will be the top five in the entire world by around February 2024 (there are no indications this was successful) and that Tesla would reach 100 exaflops by October 2024. July 19 – Tesla notes in its second-quarter earnings report it has started production of Dojo. Musk also says Tesla plans to spend more than $1 billion on Dojo through 2024. September 6 – Musk posts on X that Tesla is limited by AI training compute, but that Nvidia and Dojo will fix that. He says managing the data from the roughly 160 billion frames of video Tesla gets from its cars per day is extremely difficult. January 24 – During Tesla’s fourth-quarter and full-year earnings call, Musk acknowledges again that Dojo is a high-risk, high-reward project. He also says that Tesla was pursuing “the dual path of Nvidia and Dojo,” that “Dojo is working” and is “doing training jobs.” He notes Tesla is scaling it up and has “plans for Dojo 1.5, Dojo 2, Dojo 3 and whatnot.” January 26 – Tesla announced plans to spend $500 million to build a Dojo supercomputer in Buffalo. Musk then downplays the investment somewhat, posting on X that while $500 million is a large sum, it’s “only equivalent to a 10k H100 system from Nvidia. Tesla will spend more than that on Nvidia hardware this year. The table stakes for being competitive in AI are at least several billion dollars per year at this point.” April 30 – At TSMC’s North American Technology Symposium, the company says Dojo’s next-generation training tile — the D2, which puts the entire Dojo tile onto a single silicon wafer, rather than connecting 25 chips to make one tile — is already in production, according to IEEE Spectrum. May 20 – Musk notes that the rear portion of the Giga Texas factory extension will include the construction of “a super dense, water-cooled supercomputer cluster.” June 4 – A CNBC report reveals Musk diverted thousands of Nvidia chips reserved for Tesla to X and xAI. After initially saying the report was false, Musk posts on X that Tesla didn’t have a location to send the Nvidia chips to turn them on, due to the continued construction on the south extension of Giga Texas, “so they would have just sat in a warehouse.” He noted the extension will “house 50k H100s for FSD training.” “Of the roughly $10B in AI-related expenditures I said Tesla would make this year, about half is internal, primarily the Tesla-designed AI inference computer and sensors present in all of our cars, plus Dojo. For building the AI training superclusters, NVidia hardware is about 2/3 of the cost. My current best guess for Nvidia purchases by Tesla are $3B to $4B this year.” July 1 – Musk reveals on X that current Tesla vehicles may not have the right hardware for the company’s next-gen AI model. He says that the roughly 5x increase in parameter count with the next-gen AI “is very difficult to achieve without upgrading the vehicle inference computer.” July 23 – During Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call, Musk says demand for Nvidia hardware is “so high that it’s often difficult to get the GPUs.” “I think this therefore requires that we put a lot more effort on Dojo in order to ensure that we’ve got the training capability that we need,” Musk says. “And we do see a path to being competitive with Nvidia with Dojo.” A graph in Tesla’s investor deck predicts that Tesla AI training capacity will ramp to roughly 90,000 H100 equivalent GPUs by the end of 2024, up from around 40,000 in June. Later that day on X, Musk posts that Dojo 1 will have “roughly 8k H100-equivalent of training online by end of year.” He also posts photos of the supercomputer, which appears to use the same fridge-like stainless steel exterior as Tesla’s Cybertrucks. July 30 – AI5 is ~18 months away from high-volume production, Musk says in a reply to a post from someone claiming to start a club of “Tesla HW4/AI4 owners angry about getting left behind when AI5 comes out.” August 3 – Musk posts on X that he did a walkthrough of “the Tesla supercompute cluster at Giga Texas (aka Cortex).” He notes that it would be made roughly of 100,000 H100/H200 Nvidia GPUs with “massive storage for video training of FSD & Optimus.” August 26 – Musk posts on X a video of Cortex, which he refers to as “the giant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.” January 29 – Tesla’s Q4 and full-year 2024 earnings call included no mention of Dojo. Cortex, Tesla’s new AI training supercluster at the Austin gigafactory, did make an appearance, however. Tesla noted in its shareholder deck that it completed the deployment of Cortex, which is made up of roughly 50,000 H100 Nvidia GPUs. “Cortex helped enable V13 of FSD (Supervised), which boasts major improvements in safety and comfort thanks to 4.2x increase in data, higher resolution video inputs … among other enhancements,” according to the letter. During the call, CFO Vaibhav Taneja noted that Tesla accelerated the buildout of Cortex to speed up the rollout of FSD V13. He said that accumulated AI-related capital expenditures, including infrastructure, “so far has been approximately $5 billion.” In 2025, Taneja said he expects capex to be flat as it relates to AI. July 23 – During Tesla’s Q2 2025 earnings call, Musk said Dojo 2 was expected to be “operating at scale” sometime in 2026, with “scale being somewhere around 100k H100 equivalent.” In the same breath, he hinted at possible redundancies. “Thinking about Dojo 3 and the AI6 inference chip, it seems like intuitively, we want to try to find convergence there, where it’s basically the same chip,” Musk said. July 28 – Tesla signed a $16.5 billion deal to get its next-generation AI6 chips from Samsung. The AI6 chip is Tesla’s bet on a chip design that can scale from powering FSD and Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robots to high-performance AI training in data centers. August 6 – Bloomberg reports that close to 20 Dojo workers left to start their own company that builds AI chips, software, and hardware called DensityAI. August 7 – Bloomberg reports that Tesla has disbanded its Dojo team and shut down the project. Peter Bannon, Dojo’s lead, left the company, as well. Musk responded to the reports on X, saying: “It doesn’t make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs. The Tesla AI5, AI6 and subsequent chips will be excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training. All effort is focused on that.” August 10 – “Once it became clear that all paths converged to AI6, I had to shut down Dojo and make some tough personnel choices, as Dojo 2 was now an evolutionary dead end,” Musk posted on X, the social media platform he owns. “Dojo 3 arguably lives on in the form of a large number of AI6 [systems-on-a-chip] on a single board.” September 1 – Tesla shares its Master Plan Part IV on social media platform X. There is no mention of Dojo or Cortex, although AI, and more specifically, “physical AI” takes a central role. This story originally published August 10, 2024.

    "content": "Elon Musk says he will show off Tesla’s purpose-built “robotaxi” prototype during an event October 10, after scrapping a previous plan to reveal it August 8. Musk said Tesla will also show off “a couple of other things,” but didn’t explain what that meant. The comments, made on Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call Tuesday, largely confirms Bloomberg’s original report about the delay, including that it was driven by Musk’s desire to redesign certain elements of the prototype. Musk confirmed earlier this month that he requested an “important design change to the front.” “Moving it back a few months allowed us to improve the robotaxi, as well as add in a couple other things for the product unveil,” Musk said during the call. The Tesla robotaxi — and the “unsupervised” full self-driving software that Musk says will run them — is at the center of the company’s future. Earlier this year, he laid off more than 10% of Tesla’s global staff in a bid to reorganize the company toward developing artificial intelligence-powered products, including a “balls to the wall” push toward developing autonomy. That AI-focused future is bumping up against the company’s primary profit center of selling EVs, though. Tesla reported Tuesday that it made $1.5 billion in profit for the second quarter of 2024, down 45% from the same period last year. That profit was padded by a record $890 million in regulatory credit sales, too, though Tesla reported a $622 million restructuring charge that dragged down its earnings. And while total revenues were up 2% year-over-year, automotive revenues dropped 7% to $19.9 billion. This performance follows what was already a rough start to the year for Tesla, where it saw a 55% year-over-year drop in profit in the first quarter. The company is now looking at a real possibility of selling fewer EVs in 2024 than it did in 2023, which would represent a stunning reversal of its prior growth trajectory. Tesla has massaged this by telling investors that it is between “two major growth waves,” pinning hopes of more sales on the new (but polarizing and expensive) Cybertruck, and mysterious future models that could be sold at a lower MSRP. That’s all “in the noise,” though, according to Musk. Tesla’s long-term value lies in autonomy and autonomy alone, he stressed on Tuesday’s call. That includes the company’s humanoid robot effort, dubbed Optimus, which got a sneaky delay this week. But it mostly centers around Musk’s longest running promise that he has yet to deliver on: self-driving cars. With that in mind, Musk tried to focus investors’ attention to the October 10 event. Not much is publicly known about what Tesla will show off, though there was an illustration of a small robotaxi prototype in the biography of Musk written by Walter Isaacson in 2023. Musk has spoken about making the vehicle available to people through Tesla’s app, similar to how Uber and Lyft operate. He’s also claimed Tesla owners will be able to put their own cars on the shared network once the company makes its Full Self-Driving software advanced enough to handle all driving — something it is still far from accomplishing, despite the name. Despite years of promises, Musk has struggled to execute on the idea of fully self-driving cars, and as a result Tesla is being sued by owners and investigated by numerous government agencies. Asked on the call when Tesla would be able to offer its first unsupervised robotaxi ride, Musk said he believes it could be possible by the end of this year. But he added that it also could happen in 2025, and that he is “overly optimistic” with his predictions. This story has been updated with more details from Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call.

    "content": "Elon Musk has long been credited with turning Tesla into a beacon of innovation, the visionary who pushed the world into an era of electrification. But his slide into politics — specifically his alignment with President Trump and activities within the federal government — has dragged Tesla into uncertainty. For many would-be Tesla buyers, the brand has lost its progressive luster. And while Musk has long been the face of Tesla, that link has taken a negative turn as the billionaire oversees mass layoffs and the elimination of federal programs via the Department of Government Efficiency. Tesla’s disappointing first-quarter earnings, which saw profits drop 71% amid weakened sales and anti-Musk sentiment, demonstrate just how much the brand has fallen out of favor. The company reported 336,681 deliveries in the first three months of 2025, down from 495,570 in Q4 2024 and 386,810 in the first quarter of last year. That’s off the back of an unimpressive 2024, which saw fewer deliveries than the year prior amid production delays and increased EV competition. For many, Musk’s political activities have turned Tesla into a symbolic pariah. Tesla trade-ins have hit record highs, while sales in Europe have dropped. Foreign leaders are calling for boycotts and the automaker’s stock price has lost about half its value since December. All the while, protesters continue to assemble outside Tesla showrooms, dealerships, and even charging stations in an effort to accelerate the automaker’s brand devaluation and with it, they hope, Musk’s wealth. “They have a certain significant public image problem that’s really something we haven’t seen before in this industry,” Sean Tucker, lead editor at Kelley Blue Book, told TechCrunch. Even one of Tesla’s most unwavering bulls, Dan Ives, has begged Musk to focus less on politics and more on his business “or else unfortunately darker times are ahead for Tesla.” And even though Musk said last month that he’d take a step back from DOGE, he’s not giving up on it either. To combat the effect this might have on Tesla, Musk has and likely will continue to lean on his sales pitch that Tesla isn’t an automaker, it’s an AI company, one that will someday commercialize autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. The question now is whether the Tesla brand can recover. Below are the moments, which TechCrunch will continue to update, that are shaping perception of the Tesla brand and may have a lasting effect on its future. Tesla’s new car sales have plunged across Europe, even as sales of electric cars made by other brands rose on the continent. In the first four months of 2025, Tesla sales dropped 37.2% in Europe, and in Sweden, they dropped 81% year-over-year. Germany, traditionally one of Tesla’s largest markets and home to one of its gigafactories, has turned against Musk in a big way. A recent survey of 100,000 Germans found 94% would never purchase a Tesla, and sales data backs that up. In March 2025, Tesla’s Germany sales were down 42.5%. A slight increase from the 75% sales slump in February. The Wall Street Journal reported in May that Tesla’s board began searching for Musk’s potential successor sometime around early April as Musk waded further into Washington to slash government spending. When the report came out, Tesla chair Robyn Denholm declared the WSJ’s reporting to be “absolutely false.” Either way, the report does raise questions about succession planning if Musk-associated brand devaluation continues. Musk said during Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call that he would take a step back from DOGE, but, importantly, he also said he’d continue working for the agency for the remainder of Trump’s presidency. “Tesla Takedown” protests have been spreading around the world with the goal of encouraging people to stop buying Teslas and to sell their Tesla stock, which protesters say will hurt Musk where he holds most of his power — in his wallet (more on those below). As of the first quarter of this year, those protests have officially become an official risk in Tesla’s regulatory filings. The new risk factor in Tesla’s latest SEC filings warns that certain criticism “has incited protests, some escalating to violence targeting our operations, products and personnel.” Tesla’s lawyers also expanded what’s at risk, saying negative perceptions resulting from the protests, along with the broader criticism of the company, “may harm our brand and our business (including sales) and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed.” While Tesla is the automaker best positioned to parry the blow of Trump’s automotive tariffs in the U.S., the company is still exposed due to Musk’s alliance with the president. In April, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives cut Tesla’s price target to $315, down from $550, once again citing Musk’s politics creating a brand crisis for the automaker. He also noted that Musk’s association with Trump, and therefore his tariff policies, are not only affecting sales in the U.S. and Europe, but also threatening Tesla’s popularity in China, “further driv[ing] Chinese consumers to buy domestic such as BYD.” While recent studies found that Musk’s political leanings have lost him customers in what has historically been Tesla’s base — Democrats — the shift has garnered him street cred with Republicans. One study from researchers at Northeastern University, Columbia University, and the University of Iowa found that Republicans’ likelihood to purchase a Tesla moved up from 7% before Musk’s Trump endorsement to 10.2% after. That sentiment might only increase amid Trump’s reciprocal endorsement of Musk and Tesla, including his free commercial at the White House on March 11. At an impromptu, glitchy, livestreamed Tesla all-hands presentation on the evening of March 20, Musk told his employees and investors to “hang on to [their] stock” despite it feeling “like Armageddon.” “It’s very difficult for people in the stock market, especially those that look in the rearview mirror, which is most people, to imagine a future where suddenly a 10 million vehicle fleet has five to 10 times the usefulness,” Musk said, referring to the now-defunct claim that all existing Teslas have the hardware necessary to turn into fully self-driving cars with a mere software update. He advised employees to tune out the noise and focus on building the Cybercab, which would be the new priority. The Cybercab is a two-seater robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedals. Current federal regulations don’t allow for the mass production of such vehicles because they don’t have human controls, but Musk has signaled an intent to amend those rules. He noted that the Cybercab manufacturing process would be a feat of engineering, a “high-speed consumer electronics line” that “will move so fast that … it’ll be able to produce a car, ultimately, in less than five seconds.” During the call, Musk also promised to produce about 5,000 Optimus robots this year, which he believes will be Tesla’s most valuable asset. On the same day as the sudden all-hands, Tesla bull Dan Ives wrote in a note that Musk’s involvement in DOGE has led to a “brand tornado crisis moment for Musk and Tesla.” “If you agree or disagree with DOGE it misses the point that by Musk spending 110% of his time with DOGE (and not as Tesla CEO) since President Trump got back into the White House this has essentially turned Tesla into a political symbol … and this is a bad thing,” Ives wrote. Tesla showrooms, charging stations, facilities, and even privately owned vehicles have been hit with attacks. In some cases, the damage is minimal — some spray paint and a keyed car. In others, violence has ensued. Dealerships have been hit with bullets and Molotov cocktails, and charging stations have been set on fire. Musk has responded by questioning why anyone would want to hurt Tesla. Trump’s response has been more pointed. He has declared that any acts of violence — which could include spray-painting — would be treated by the federal government as domestic terrorism. “I look forward to watching the sick terrorist thugs get 20-year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla. Perhaps they could serve them in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions!” Trump said on his social media platform, Truth Social. As of the time of this writing, the Department of Justice has brought charges against three individuals who are allegedly responsible for violent destruction of Tesla properties. Peaceful protests have also erupted across the country as part of the Tesla Takedown movement. Protesters have been showing up at Tesla dealerships and showrooms to try to discourage people from buying Tesla cars. They also aim to encourage Tesla owners to trade in their vehicles and Tesla stockholders to sell their shares. Despite these protests being peaceful, we’re beginning to see the start of violent counterprotests — like the Florida man who drove his SUV into a crowd of protestors outside a Palm Beach Tesla dealership in March. Thousands of people joined in Tesla Takedown protests the last weekend in March at showrooms across the country. The crowds drew small numbers of counterprotests in some regions that were peopled mainly by MAGA supporters, Wired reports. Among them were far-right extremists, including members of the Proud Boys and armed militias. While speaking at a rally celebrating Trump’s inauguration in January, Musk did what many have perceived to be not one, but two, Nazi salutes. The damage has only been amplified by Musk’s vocal support for the far-right German political party AfD, as well as his history of sharing antisemitic posts. Shortly after the salute incident, activists projected an image of Musk doing the salute, along with the word “Heil,” onto Tesla’s Berlin gigafactory. One of Tesla’s biggest competitors, China’s BYD, has been touting significant breakthroughs in charging. The automaker said this week that its new cars can be charged in five minutes, which would give it a huge competitive edge over Tesla and indeed any other EV maker. China is one of Tesla’s largest markets, but BYD is continuing to bully the automaker on its home turf. BYD recently unveiled its “God’s Eye” advanced driver-assistance system — akin to Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD — that will be installed at no additional cost on its entire EV lineup, including its ultra-cheap $9,600 Seagull hatchback. BYD continues to impress consumers with its high-tech range of EVs and hybrids and has once again surpassed Tesla on revenue. In 2024, BYD reported $107 billion in revenue compared to Tesla’s $97.7 billion. Tesla has languished with an aging lineup for years. The Cybertruck was meant to be the automaker’s next big bet that would prove it’s still capable of delivering innovative new models. And indeed, the truck has been popular among American buyers. Still, Tesla has issued eight recalls on the Cybertruck since launching the vehicle in November 2023. Most recently, Tesla had to recall 46,000 Cybertrucks because of an exterior steel trim panel on the side of the windshield that looks like it was stuck on with superglue and can just peel off.

    "content": "SpaceX employees are more likely to be injured while working at Starbase than any of its other manufacturing facilities, according to company worker safety records reviewed by TechCrunch. Starbase, a sprawling launch-and-manufacturing site that recently incorporated as its own Texas city, logged injury rates that were almost 6x higher than the average for comparable space vehicle-manufacturing outfits and nearly 3x higher than aerospace manufacturing as a whole in 2024, according to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) data released in May. That outsized injury rate has persisted since 2019, when SpaceX began sharing Starbase injury data with the federal regulator. Starbase is home to SpaceX’s most ambitious program: a fully reusable, ultra-heavy-lift rocket called Starship. The company has been moving at a breakneck pace to bring Starship online to launch Starlink internet satellites and other payloads. Since Starship’s first orbital test in April 2023, SpaceX has attempted eight additional integrated flights. During three of those tests, the company made history by catching the massive Super Heavy booster with “chopstick” arms attached to the launch tower. The data suggests that SpaceX’s rapid progress comes at a cost. And while injury rates alone don’t provide a complete picture of the safety culture at Starbase, they do offer a rare glimpse into the working conditions of the world’s leading space company. OSHA uses a standardized safety metric called Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) to measure a company’s safety record and compare it to industry peers, like Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance. The publicly available data has limitations. It doesn’t distinguish between minor injuries like stitches versus serious incidents such as amputations. TechCrunch calculated the TRIR based on that data, which includes the total number of incidents and total number of hours worked by SpaceX employees at each site. Starbase, which plays a central role in SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s mission to make life multi-planetary, is an outlier in the company and across the industry as a whole. Its TRIR topped out at 4.27 injuries per 100 workers in 2024, when it employed an average of 2,690 workers, according to the data submitted to OSHA. Injured Starbase employees were unable to perform their normal job duties for a total of 3,558 restricted-duty days, plus 656 lost-time days where injuries made them unable to work at all. Starbase is classified by the U.S. government as a space vehicle-manufacturing operation. The injury rate in this sector has fallen dramatically since 1994, dropping from 4.2 injuries per 100 workers to 0.7 injuries per 100 workers in 2023, according to historical data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (BLS calculates these rates through its annual company surveys, which asks for the same information found in OSHA’s worker injury forms.) But despite major changes in safety processes across the industry, Starbase is closer to the rates of 30 years ago. The injury rate across all of SpaceX’s manufacturing facilities — which includes an engine development and testing site in McGregor, Texas; a Starlink satellite-manufacturing complex in Bastrop, Texas; the Falcon rocket complex in Hawthorne, California; and another satellite-manufacturing site in Redmond, Washington — is 2.28. These other facilities report lower TRIR rates, though most still exceed the industry averages. For instance, 2024 data shows TRIR rates of 2.48 at McGregor, 3.49 at Bastrop, 1.43 at Hawthorne, 2.89 at Redmond. The 2024 TRIR for aerospace manufacturing as a whole is 1.6. SpaceX also operates several non-manufacturing sites, including barge operations off both coasts; offices in Sunnyvale, California; and launch sites at Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Space Force Base. Former OSHA chief of staff Debbie Berkowitz told TechCrunch via email that Starbase’s TRIR “is a red flag that there are serious safety issues that need to be addressed.” However, there is a debate among safety professionals about whether TRIR is the most reliable metric for assessing and predicting injury rates, particularly serious incidents like fatalities, and especially for small companies. A recent paper on TRIR questioned its statistical validity and advocated that organizations use alternative measures of safety performance instead. Of the 14 OSHA inspections at SpaceX facilities over the past four years, six involved accidents and injuries at Starbase. That includes a partial finger amputation in 2021 and a crane collapse in June 2025. The latter inspection is still ongoing. Investigations by other news outlets, including Reuters, have uncovered hundreds of previously unreported worker injuries, including crushed limbs and one fatality. The 2024 injury rate at Starbase marks an improvement to that of the prior year, which topped out at 5.9 injuries per 100 workers in 2023 and 4.8 injuries in 2022. But it still leads among SpaceX’s land-based facilities and is second overall only to its West Coast booster recovery operations, which has a TRIR of 7.6. OSHA confirmed TechCrunch’s calculation of Starbase’s TRIR over email, but otherwise did not respond to questions regarding that location’s injury rate. SpaceX did not respond to request for comment. NASA has a major stake in Starship’s development. The agency is counting on using the rocket to return humans to the moon before the end of this decade, and it is paying more than $4 billion to SpaceX for two crewed Starship flights to the lunar surface. Both the contract for the Starship lander and SpaceX’s contract for its Commercial Crew services to the International Space Station contain particular clauses that allow the agency to take action in the case of a major breach of safety, such as a fatality or a “willful” or “repeat” OSHA violation. While a persistently high TRIR rate can be evidence of a safety problem, it is not an automatic trigger for action and does not fall under the definition of a “major breach of safety” in their contracts. “NASA interacts frequently with its partners, including SpaceX, to ensure safety from a mission assurance perspective, and remains in regular contact with the company during normal contract administration,” a NASA spokesperson told TechCrunch in response to questions about the company’s TRIR. “Safety is paramount to NASA’s mission success. The agency continues to work with all our commercial partners to build and maintain a healthy safety culture.” Among rocket makers with vehicles in operation, Starbase still leads the pack: at ULA’s manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama, the TRIR is 1.12 injuries per 100 workers; at Blue Origin’s rocket park on the coast of Florida, the rate is 1.09.

    "content": "SpaceX said Monday that last month’s Starship explosion was brought on by a cascading series of events caused by propellant leaks — a problem the company says has been addressed ahead of an eighth test flight that could happen as early as Friday. The spaceflight company is still waiting for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to either officially close the “mishap investigation” into the explosion, or specially authorize SpaceX to perform the flight while the investigation continues. This is, notably, the first time SpaceX has been subjected to a mishap investigation while CEO Elon Musk is operating inside the United States government, with workers from his so-called Department of Government Efficiency actively making changes at the FAA. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. SpaceX’s January test of Starship started off fine enough. The company was hoping to test out a number of upgrades to the Super Heavy booster, the launch-and-catch tower, and on Starship itself. The heavy-lift rocket system launched without any problem and headed off to space, with the booster eventually separating and coming back down to the ground in Texas where it was caught by the tower. The problems started about two minutes after Starship ignited its own rocket engines to get to orbit. The company wrote in a blog post that “a flash was observed in the aft section of the vehicle near one of the Raptor vacuum engines.” Sensors onboard the ship started picking up a rise in pressure after the flash “indicative of a leak” of propellant, according to SpaceX. Another flash was seen two minutes later, and SpaceX says “sustained fires” began in that section of Starship due to the leaks. The fires caused “all but one of Starship’s engines to execute controlled shut down sequences and ultimately led to a loss of communication with the ship.” SpaceX says the leaks were most likely caused by vibrations that exceeded what the company expected from testing, “which led to increased stress on hardware in the propulsion system.” The automatic in-flight abort system eventually triggered the destruction of the ship following the fires and communications blackout. That explosion led to a spectacular display over the islands of Turks and Caicos, and also resulted in the FAA diverting a number of flights to avoid any danger. SpaceX claims that all of the Starship debris “came down within the pre-planned Debris Response Area” — a sort of safe-zone that it typically negotiates ahead of flights with government agencies. Residents have been posting photos of debris washing up on beaches and at least one vehicle was struck, receiving minor damage. SpaceX says it has made changes to the lines that send fuel to Starship’s engines, tweaked the temperature of the propellant, and has added extra vents and “a new purge system” to make the aft section in question “more robust to propellant leakage.” Sean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "content": "The Federal Aviation Administration has concluded its review of SpaceX’s investigation of the second Starship launch in November, with the regulator saying Monday that it accepted the “root causes and 17 corrective actions” identified by the company. While this means the investigation is now closed, SpaceX must implement all the corrective actions and apply for a modified launch license before it can fly Starship again. “The FAA is evaluating SpaceX’s license modification request and expects SpaceX to submit additional required information before a final determination can be made,” the regulator said in a statement Monday. SpaceX’s second orbital flight test of the nearly 400-foot-tall Starship rocket in November went farther than the first test by a huge margin: all 33 of the Raptor engines on the Super Heavy booster powered on successfully and none failed in the course of the nearly three-minute ascent burn. The company also pulled off a spectacularly difficult “hot-stage separation” for the first time, wherein the Starship upper stage lit up to push away from the booster. But like the first test, which occurred last April, it ended in a fiery explosion mid-air. When any rocket launch encounters catastrophic issues during flight, the FAA opens what’s known as a “mishap investigation” — that’s what’s happened here. These are led by the company and reviewed by regulators, who must sign off on the analysis and ensure the corrective actions are actually implemented. After the first test, the FAA directed SpaceX to complete 63 corrective actions. Per the FAA, the company ultimately identified seven changes to the booster and 10 to the Starship vehicle: “Seven booster corrective actions were identified, including redesigns of vehicle hardware to increase tank filtration and reduce slosh, updated thrust vector control system modelling, reevaluation of engine analyses based on OFT-2 data, and updated engine control algorithms. Ten Starship corrective actions were identified, including hardware redesigns to increase robustness and reduce complexity, hardware changes to reduce leaks, operational changes eliminating pre-second engine cutoff propellant dumps, flammability analysis updates, installation of additional fire protection, creation of analytical guidance, performance of transient load analysis, and modeling updates.” In an update also published Monday, SpaceX demystified some of these corrective actions in a rare post-launch postmortem, with the company noting that the likely root cause of the booster’s “rapid unscheduled disassembly” — aerospace lingo for “explosion” — was a filter blockage in one of the Raptor engines. This engine failed “energetically,” the company said, which led to a total loss of the booster. The Starship upper stage met its own end around seven minutes into the flight, when a propellant leak started a fire that severed communication between the spacecraft’s onboard computers. This led to an engine shutdown, which then triggered the autonomous flight termination system to destroy the vehicle. Some of these hardware changes and design upgrades have already been introduced to the versions of the vehicle that will fly for the third orbital flight test, SpaceX said in the update. Company CEO Elon Musk said during a conversation on his social media platform, X, that mission could take place as soon as the second week of March. “More Starships are ready to fly, putting flight hardware in a flight environment to learn as quickly as possible. Recursive improvement is essential as we work to build a fully reusable launch system capable of carrying satellites, payloads, crew, and cargo to a variety of orbits and Earth, lunar, or Martian landing sites,” SpaceX said in the update. Ultimately, SpaceX is aiming to complete the full mission profile, which includes the Super Heavy booster completing a “boost back burn” and executing a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. Starship would then fly halfway around the world and land in the Pacific Ocean. Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "content": "SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket lifted off on its 10th test flight Tuesday evening, hitting two long-sought milestones and putting an end to a string of failures. The 403-foot vehicle lifted off from Starbase, SpaceX’s launch facility and recently incorporated city, at 7:30 p.m. ET after two scrubs earlier this week. The rocket ascended on 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines before separating around three minutes after liftoff. On descent, the Super Heavy booster tested out a new maneuver: intentionally shutting down the engines used for landing and transitioning to backup engines. The test will help engineers understand how the booster might perform in the case of failure. The test appeared to go as planned, with the 232-foot-tall booster successfully making a targeted splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. Meanwhile, the upper stage, also called Starship, reached space. There, for the first time on a Starship flight, it opened its Pez-style payload door and released eight Starlink mass-simular satellites. This is a capability that SpaceX had planned but failed to demonstrate on earlier missions. The company also successfully relit one of the Raptor engines in space before guiding the vehicle toward the Indian Ocean, where it splashed down, tipped over, and promptly exploded. On the way down, the exterior of the ship was exposed to incredible heat during atmospheric reentry, providing an excellent test environment for the upgraded thermal-protection system. SpaceX also used this test to try out a series of experiments, like removing tiles from sections of the ship to see how its “skin” operates on reentry, plus a new metallic tile and an actively cooled tile. Most importantly, however, is the upper stage completed the entire test and splashed down in the Indian Ocean without losing comms with SpaceX engineers. During the last flight, the ship reached space and then lost attitude control during the coast phase, preventing the payload doors from opening. Engineers appear to have overcome those issues. It’s a big win for SpaceX, which has repeatedly lost the Starship upper stage due to a series of technical failures during flight. The persistent issues have raised questions as to whether the rocket will be ready to land humans on the moon by mid-2027 for NASA, or when it will be capable of deploying next-gen Starlink satellites for the company. This test marks a material advancement for the Starship program, which the company wants to eventually use to send humans and cargo to Mars. While SpaceX still has to complete a series of tough technical milestones before it can get there, it got one step closer tonight.

    "content": "As regulators weigh SpaceX’s plans to launch its massive Starship rocket from Kennedy Space Center, federal documents warn those flights could ripple through Florida airspace, forcing ground stops at multiple airports, reroutes, and delays of up to two hours. Even after launch, reentry of Starship’s two stages could require ground stops at some of the busiest airports in the country, according to a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) released by the Federal Aviation Administration this month. Florida airports affected by the launches may include Orlando International, Miami International, Tampa International, and Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International. Average delays could be as long as 40 minutes to 2 hours for launches and Super Heavy booster landings, and 40 minutes to one hour for Starship reentries. Diversions and cancellations are possible, the FAA said in a companion slide deck. To manage risk, the FAA would establish Aircraft Hazard Areas (AHAs) over potentially impacted zones, as it does for commercial space launches today. Depending on the Starship flight trajectory, those zones could overlay routes above the Atlantic, parts of the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and airspace in several Central American countries. “AHAs may necessitate the closure of dozens of coastal and deep-water oceanic airways over the Atlantic Ocean, requiring substantial aircraft rerouting to avoid the AHAs,” the draft EIS says regarding Starship launches. Tampa International Airport spokesperson Emily Nipps told TechCrunch the airport has not been involved in any briefings or procedural planning with the FAA or SpaceX, so far. However, a day after TechCrunch sent its inquiries to the relevant airports and the FAA, Nipps said the airport was informed it would be having those discussions “soon.” “Whether that changes anything for us operationally, I don’t yet know,” she said. A spokesperson for Miami International said they have not received any briefings on possible ground stops. SpaceX has been launching its flagship Falcon rockets from the Florida coast for years, and that cadence has sharply increased since 2020. Despite launching over 80 Falcon rockets from the Eastern Range last year, these launches don’t typically interrupt commercial airlines. But the Falcon rockets are substantially different from Starship: Falcon’s smaller size means a smaller possible footprint for debris in the case of an anomaly, and the Falcon launches are at this point predictable and mature. Starship is in a much earlier stage of development, with vehicles still occasionally blowing up during both ground tests and orbital flights. Indeed, the draft EIS notes that the size of airspace closures may vary with each Starship mission, and that it could shrink as the vehicle becomes more reliable. An FAA spokesperson said the agency has already engaged with aviation organizations, and worked with SpaceX to develop notional launch and reentry trajectories. Prior to launch, the agency will also distribute a final Airspace Management Plan. The FAA relies on a number of factors, including the number of affected passengers, launch window duration, and major holidays when determining when a space launch can proceed, the spokesperson added. Starship is SpaceX’s next-generation launch system designed for travel to the moon and Mars. The 400-foot-tall rocket is composed of two stages: an upper stage, also called Starship, and a Super Heavy booster. Both stages are designed to be fully reusable and rapidly refurbished for high-cadence satellite delivery and missions to deep space. Today, SpaceX conducts all Starship launch activities from Starbase in south Texas. But the company is looking to expand operations to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, prompting the environmental review. That review is conducted by the FAA in cooperation with NASA, the Air Force, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and other federal agencies. The draft EIS analyzes up to 44 Starship launches per year, which could include up to 44 Super Heavy booster landings and 44 Starship landings. Super Heavy could land back at LC-39A, the launch pad at KSC, on a droneship, or be expended in the Atlantic. Starship landings could likewise occur at the pad, on a ship, or as water splashdowns with recovery in the Atlantic, Pacific, or Indian Oceans. The FAA said in the draft EIS that while temporary airspace closures may impact commercial airlines and other stakeholders, “mitigation strategies such as pre-coordinated reroutes, dynamic scheduling, and time-based traffic flow management could reduce operational burdens.” Today, the FAA uses a prototype tool called Space Data Integrator, which ingests real-time flight data from SpaceX and other operators to shrink the amount of time airspace is closed. The regulator says it wants to develop more tools to beef up its situational awareness capability, and each time Starship launches it will get more data on its operations. The U.S. Space Force is running a parallel environmental review at neighboring Cape Canaveral Space Force Base that analyzes up to 76 annual Starship launches. While the draft EIS for that site states Starship launches would result in airspace closures, it says details of the closures are not yet known because the site is expected to take months to prepare.

    "content": "SpaceX has launched its most public and aggressive offensive against regulators to date, with a blog post published Tuesday urging more expeditious launch licensing — lest the country lose its place as the leader in the global space race. Orbital launch is a tightly regulated industry governed chiefly by the Federal Aviation Administration, though to obtain a launch license from the FAA, companies must also show they are in compliance with local and environmental law. Rockets that operate commercial services regularly, like SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, do so under a blanket vehicle operator license. Due to the iterative nature of SpaceX’s Starship heavy lift vehicle test program, which has included updates to hardware and new sets of test objectives with each mission, SpaceX must seek a modification to its vehicle operator license before each launch. These license modifications have taken months each to issue. But SpaceX has had the next test flight hardware ready much sooner and has typically flown within days of receiving each license modification. SpaceX is currently awaiting approval for its fifth test flight. The hardware was ready to fly as of the first week of August, but the company recently received a launch license date estimate of late November from the FAA, the blog post says. For the next test, SpaceX is preparing to conduct the most ambitious objective yet in its Starship test program: returning the Super Heavy booster to the launch site and catching it in mid-air. As the company acknowledges, a booster catch would be “singularly novel” in the history of rocketry. The only analogue would be the routine Falcon 9 booster landings, but those boosters are significantly smaller than Falcon Heavy and require no infrastructure other than a safe landing zone, like a pad or a barge. In contrast, the company will try to catch Super Heavy using mechanical arms called “chopsticks” attached to Starship’s massive launch tower. “It’s understandable that such a unique operation would require additional time to analyze from a licensing perspective,” the company says in the blog post. “Unfortunately,” it continues, “instead of focusing resources on critical safety analysis and collaborating on rational safeguards to protect both the public and the environment, the licensing process has been repeatedly derailed by issues ranging from the frivolous to the patently absurd.” Though the space company has already made its arguments before regulators through official filings, leadership there appears to think a more public airing of grievances is warranted. This most recent delay in particular is not based on new safety concerns, SpaceX claims, but “superfluous environmental analysis” related to multiple aspects of the launches, like the sonic booms and SpaceX’s water deluge system. For example, the FAA recently approved additional 60-day analyses over the sonic booms and the jettisoning of a piece of hardware called the hot-stage into the Gulf of Mexico during flight, two issues that the company says have been “exhaustively analyzed.” These consultations “could indefinitely delay launch without addressing any plausible impact to the environment,” SpaceX says. The company takes particular umbrage with recent reporting from CNBC on the Starship water deluge system at the Starbase launch facility near Boca Chica, Texas. The water deluge system is used to disperse the enormous amount of heat and sound generated during lift-off. According to CNBC, SpaceX recently received violation notices from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) for discharging industrial wastewater without a permit. Immediately after the story was published in August, SpaceX hit back on X, saying that the system only uses potable water and that continued operation of the water deluge was explicitly allowed by regulators as the company works on its permit with TCEQ. Although the company strenuously insists that it was working in good faith with regulators, the FAA nevertheless delayed public meetings related to a separate environmental review at Starbase just a day after the CNBC report was published. In a statement, the FAA said that it “was unable to confirm the accuracy of certain representations in SpaceX’s license application” after the agency “became aware of allegations that SpaceX violated the Clean Water Act at the Boca Chica Launch Site.” Now, despite the “small, but vocal minority of detractors trying to game the regulatory system to obstruct and delay the development of Starship,” SpaceX says it will press on.

    "content": "One of SpaceX’s Starship rockets exploded on a test stand in Texas late on Wednesday night, as the company prepared for the tenth test flight of the heavy-lift rocket system. SpaceX said “all personnel are safe and accounted for” in a post on X, and claimed there are “no hazards to residents in surrounding communities.” The company said in a later update on Thursday that an initial analysis suggests the explosion was caused by a failure of a “pressurized tank known as a COPV, or composite overwrapped pressure vessel” in the Starship’s nosecone. The enormous explosion caused damage to the area surrounding the test stand, according to SpaceX. But the company said there are no reported injuries. SpaceX was preparing to perform a “static fire” of the Starship’s six Raptor engines, and so the area around the rocket had been cleared prior to the explosion. It’s not immediately clear what impact this will have on SpaceX’s development of the Starship rocket system. A recent advisory from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) suggested the tenth test flight could have happened as soon as June 29. That will most likely be delayed as the company works through what went wrong on Wednesday night. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said in a post seemingly related to the explosion that he considers it to be: “Just a scratch.” ANOMALY! Just before Ship 36 was set to Static Fire, it blew up at SpaceX Masseys!Live on X and YT:https://t.co/GPjZIX1Zyd pic.twitter.com/CfZhDeSGae SpaceX has spent the last few years aggressively developing the 171-foot Starship and the massive 232-foot Super Heavy booster that powers it into space. The company started 2025 saying this year would be a “transformational” one for the program, and the FAA recently increased its limit on Starship launches in Texas from five to 25. But Starship, in particular, has had a number of problems this year. The rocket unexpectedly exploded during its seventh test flight in January, and then again in March. It failed again during its ninth test in May. While the rocket made it further into its most recent flight in May than during the previous two tests, it still failed to deploy the dummy Starlink satellites it was carrying onboard — a crucial step in the company’s plan to use the mega-rocket to grow its space-based internet service. Musk has maintained that SpaceX is on track to try to send a Starship to Mars in 2026, giving it a “50/50” chance in a company update in May. The company is also developing a larger “Version 3” of Starship that, Musk claimed, could fly as early as this year. This story has been updated with new information from SpaceX about what it believes to be the cause of the explosion.

    "content": "Farewell, V2: SpaceX on Monday night sent Starship’s current configuration on one last test flight, in a mission that the company says hit all its key goals, moving the program into its next phase. The nearly 400-foot-tall rocket lifted off from Starbase, Texas at 6:23 p.m. local time. The Super Heavy booster, reused from a March test, tried a new landing-burn profile, reigniting 13 engines before throttling down to five, and finally three for the final hover before completing a planned soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico roughly seven minutes after liftoff. Meanwhile, Starship’s upper stage deployed eight mock Starlink satellite simulators, trialing a new “dynamic banking maneuver” profile that the company aims to use for future return-to-pad attempts at Starbase. The upper stage then splashed down in the Indian Ocean. This marked the final launch of the second-gen Starship and the first-gen Super Heavy variants. As with the previous test flight, engineers also experimented with the heat shield tiles on the upper stage, including selective removals and novel tile variations to gather reentry data. SpaceX also duplicated Flight 10’s other key milestones: deploying simulators, and relighting one of Starship’s six Raptor engines on orbit. Monday’s test formally started the program’s next phase: flying an upgraded prototype called V3, outfitted for in-orbit docking and propellant-transfer demonstrations, capabilities essential for crafts that aim to reach the moon and Mars. SpaceX says V3 also incorporates structural changes and upgrades to the Raptor engine that are aimed at increasing lifting capacity, though the company did not share specific figures. “This next iteration will be used for the first Starship orbital flights, operational payload missions, propellant transfer, and more as we iterate to a fully and rapidly reusable vehicle with service to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and beyond,” the company said. In parallel, SpaceX is upgrading Pad A at Starbase, and shifting launches to Pad B. The company is simultaneously working to build dual Starship launch pads in Cape Canaveral and Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Starship is the most powerful rocket ever developed. It’s also the cornerstone of both NASA’s Artemis campaign and SpaceX’s plan to start deploying higher-capacity Starlink satellites. Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy applauded the mission on X, saying it was “another major step toward landing Americans on the Moon’s south pole.” SpaceX was awarded more than $4 billion to develop a human-rated variant of Starship, called the Human Landing System, for the Artemis 3 crewed mission currently scheduled for 2027. But meeting that date will require SpaceX to demonstrate increasingly complex milestones first, especially orbital docking and in-orbit propellant transfer.

    "content": "The Orionid meteor shower peaked on the nights of Oct. 21-23, delighting lucky stargazers with a gorgeous natural fireworks display as debris from Halley's Comet collided with Earth's atmosphere to create fiery shooting stars in the night sky. Photographer Osama Fathi was among these lucky skywatchers, and captured a spectacular view of Orionid meteors streaking through the sky over Lake Qarun in Egypt on Oct. 19, as the shower ramped up activity ahead of its 3-day peak. \"This composite image combines a few meteor frames captured over three hours from Qatrani, near the northern edge of the lake,\" Fathi told Space.com in an email. \"Out of more than 200 photos taken during the session, only a handful of bright meteors aligned gracefully near the constellation Orion — visible at the center right of the frame.\" Fathi's composite skyscape was created by combining a three-minute exposure of the night sky with multiple 10-second shots of meteors captured using a Nikon Z6 camera fitted with a 14-24 mm Nikkor lens. The peak of the 2025 Orionid meteor shower coincided with October's new moon phase, which presented stargazers with a magnificently dark night sky in which even the faintest shooting stars could be spotted flaring to life against the starfield beyond. The Nikon Z8 excels in just about every department and we rate it as the best overall camera out there. It features a full-frame 45.7MP sensor, 8K video capabilities, excellent low-light performance, very high FPS burst speed and more. It is pricey, but you get a lot of bang for your buck. Check out our Nikon Z8 review for a more in-depth look. If clouds conspired to ruin your view during the Oct. 21-23 peak, there's no need to worry, as there'll be plenty more shooting stars to see in the coming days, according to Robert Lunsford of the American Meteor Society. \"Rates will fall very slowly after these dates so the mornings of October 24-26 will still provide hourly rates in excess of 10 per hour when viewing from rural dark skies,\" Lunsford told Space.com in an email. \"Note by then the radiant will have moved eastward into western Gemini so folks should not be surprised to see these meteors shooting from that constellation instead of Orion\".

    "content": "There is so much to see in the night sky tonight, here's what you can look forward to. A good telescope or pair of binoculars will help you see some of the night sky’s fainter objects. However, the unaided eye is enough to learn its stars and constellations, watch the moon, experience meteor showers and see satellites whizz across the night sky. Read on to find out what you can see in the night sky tonight, from planetary meet-ups to the ever-changing moon phases, meteor showers and more. Want to look even further ahead? Check out our monthly night sky guide our brightest planets guide also tells you what planets are visible and when this month. Track the ISS | Starlink satellite train | Moon viewing guide Sign up for our skywatching newsletter \"Night Sky This Week\" to discover this week's must-see night sky events, moon phases, and stunning astrophotos. This won’t be an easy sight, but it’s worth a shot. Look west-southwest 45 minutes after sunset for the waxing crescent moon. It will be just 5%-illuminated, so it won’t be easy to spot. If you do find it, range your eyes to its right for tiny Mercury and, just beyond it, Mars. At mag. -0.1, Mercury will be the easiest of the two planets to spot. There will be about two degrees between each object in the trio — about the width of a thumb held up against the night sky at arm’s length. Timing is everything for this one because all three will quickly set together soon after sunset. — Jamie Carter Glimpsing a \"shooting star\" while you're stargazing is one thing; schlepping to a dark sky park to purposely take in the peak of a meteor shower is quite another. If you're only going to do the latter once a year, make it the Geminids in December, when 150 coloured meteors are expected under dark moonless skies. If you're up for a second, try tonight's Orionids, which occur just a day after the new moon under near-perfect stargazing conditions. It promises around 20 meteors per hour, around midnight, which isn't huge, but it's more than most meteor shower peaks. It's one of two meteor showers, along with April's Eta Aquariids, created by Halley's Comet. — Jamie Carter After many months of watching these three bright stars moving gradually across the summer night sky, the Summer Triangle is almost at the end of its seasonal reign. Tonight after dark, watch it sink to the western horizon on its side, with Deneb and Vega above west and Altair to the southwest. Grab one last look at the beautiful constellation of Cygnus, the swan — anchored by Deneb — that pierces the Summer Triangle and the arc of the Milky Way in summer night skies. It'll be back, rising in the east in late May next year. — Jamie Carter Today at 8:25 a.m. EDT, the new moon will be positioned between the Earth and the sun, making it invisible to the naked eye. That leaves the night skies completely free from any moonlight. Although the peak of the Orionid meteor shower is considered to be tomorrow by some, it's a broad peak, and you're likely to see some meteors tonight. Either way, it's a perfect night for stargazing, clear skies allowing. Why not trace out the four corner stars of Orion — Betelgeuse, Bellatrix, Rigel and Saiph — and the three stars of Orion's Belt within it (Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka) while you wait for \"shooting stars?\" — Jamie Carter The dark evening skies this week are perfect for finding a little-known constellation in the northern sky. Said to be a king, but actually resembling a square or a simple line drawing of a house, Cepheus is easiest to find using the well-known Cassiopeia constellation. Wait until an hour before midnight, and you’ll find the five stars of Cassiopeia in an M-shape due north. Directly below it is Cepheus, a square of four stars with a fifth star, Errai, to the right. The brightest star in Cepheus is Alderamin, which tonight is at the bottom-left. — Jamie Carter It’s a weak meteor shower, producing just three “shooting stars” per hour during its peak tonight, but the Epsilon Geminids do at least arrive this year during October’s dark sky window. Active between Oct. 14-27, 2025, according to The Sky Live, the Epsilon Geminids will come from close to Castor and Pollux, the brightest stars in the constellation Gemini. This minor shower overlaps with the Orionid meteor shower, which peaks on Wednesday, Oct. 22, 2025. — Jamie Carter Rise 90 minutes before sunrise and look to the eastern night sky, and you’ll see something truly spectacular — the slimmest possible crescent moon close to a very bright planet. The moon, now in its waning crescent phase, will be merely 4%-illuminated. That’s a beautiful sight in itself. However, just to its lower-left, Venus will rise into the sky, shining at mag. -3.9. There will be about four degrees between the pair. — Jamie Carter Look to the southeast after dark tonight to find Saturn, shining brightly at mag. 0.8. Exactly 28 years ago, on Oct. 15, 1997, NASA’s Cassini spacecraft launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, destined to explore the sixth planet from the sun. It was active for nearly 20 years until it was purposely plunged into Saturn on Sept. 15, 2017. Perhaps its most iconic moment came when it deposited a tiny probe, Huygens, to land on Saturn’s moon Titan. It sent back this incredible Titan Touchdown video that never fails to wow. — Jamie Carter Look east an hour before sunrise for a close conjunction between a 23%-illuminated waning crescent moon and Regulus, the brightest star in the constellation Leo. The two will be separated by about a degree, the equivalent of the width of a little finger held up against the night sky at arm’s length. As sunrise nears, Venus will pop up low in the eastern sky. — Jamie Carter Today sees the beginning of two meteor showers associated with the constellation Taurus, the Southern Taurids and Northern Taurids. They both begin today and peak on Nov. 3-4 and Nov. 8-9, respectively, which is close to the next full moon. Both are caused by comet 2P/Encke, which orbits the sun once every 3.3 years, according to NASA. The Southern Taurids and Northern Taurids each produce only around five \"shooting stars\" each per hour, but are famous for spawning extremely bright meteors that we call \"fireballs!\" Look out for them when you're stargazing over the next few weeks, they'll appear to have come from the east. — Jamie Carter Jupiter has been shining brightly close to the stars of the constellation Gemini for some months. This morning, visible in the east just after midnight and in the southwest before sunrise, the giant planet will form a vast triangle with Pollux in Gemini and a passing last-quarter moon. Pollux is one of the \"twins\" of Gemini. Its brother, Castor, is just above it, helping to create a Y-shape with Pollux, Jupiter and the moon.— Jamie Carter Look to the east a few hours after sunset to see a 77%-lit waning gibbous moon form a cosmic triangle with the Hyades and Pleiades open star clusters. While the Pleiades is 445 light-years from the sun, the Hyades is just 150 light-years. The Hyades covers a broader region of the sky than the Pleiades and is found around the bright orange star Aldebaran in the constellation Taurus. — Jamie Carter The Delta Aurigids are nothing to get excited about, but they may add an occasional sparkle to any stargazing session. If you're out with a telescope in the few hours before sunrise and you see a \"shooting star,\" it's probably from the Delta Aurigid meteor shower. It peaks early today, though only about two meteors per hour are expected. Emanating from close to bright star Capella in the constellation Auriga, the weak Delta Aurigid meteor shower runs from Oct. 10-18, 2025, according to In-The-Sky.org. — Jamie Carter It's one of the most famous stars in the night sky, but have you ever watched Betelgeuse rise? Today, it does so alongside a 56%-illuminated waning gibbous moon very close to its last quarter phase. The action will happen just before midnight, with red supergiant Betelgeuse rising in the east, with the moon on its left and the other very bright star in Orion, the blue supergiant Rigel, on its right. Look between Betelgeuse and Rigel for the three stars of Orion's Belt, rising nearly vertically as it clears the horizon. Jupiter will rise beneath the moon soon after. — Jamie Carter The moon has been passing through the Pleiades a lot in 2025, but tonight's conjunction is particularly close. Look east a couple of hours after sunset, and you'll see an 88%-illuminated waning gibbous moon less than a degree from the sparkling open cluster. Watch the Pleiades for the next few hours and you'll see the moon pass across its stars — a beautiful sight! — Jamie Carter At just 10 “shooting stars” per hour, the annual Draconid meteor shower is not the most prolific of the year. However, it’s one of the most convenient because it’s visible as soon as it gets dark. That’s because not only does Earth pass close to the orbit of comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner each Oct. 8, but the source constellation, Draco (the dragon), is close to Polaris, the North Star. It’s therefore circumpolar — high in the northern sky all night — so its meteors are visible to anyone in the Northern Hemisphere as soon as it gets dark. — Jamie Carter Here comes the main event — the appearance of the full Harvest Moon on the eastern horizon just after sunset. From North America, the full moon will rise several minutes after sunset, allowing it to shine a little brighter and a little earlier than last night. Get into position a few minutes before the time of moonrise where you are, with an unobstructed view east for the best chance of seeing the orange orb peek above the horizon. It's called the Harvest Moon this year — as opposed to the usual Hunter's Moon name for October's full moon — because it's the closest full moon to the equinox on Sept. 22, 2025. — Jamie Carter The moon turns full today, but since that global moment comes just 11 minutes before midnight for the eastern region of North America (11:47 p.m. EDT), it affects when it will look best in North America. In fact, the full moon will rise in the east within about 10–20 minutes of sunset, depending on location, so it will look pale as it becomes visible on the horizon. It will look full — and appear as an orange orb as the light fades — but you'll have to come back 24 hours later on Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2025, to see a more impactful sight as it rises in the east in a slightly darker sky. — Jamie Carter Look south-southeast after dark to see a waxing gibbous moon, now 87%-illuminated, directly above bright star Fomalhaut — the \"Autumn Star\" — with Saturn about the same distance to its left. One of the brightest stars in the night sky, but not visible above mid-northern latitudes, Fomalhaut is the most prominent star in the constellation Piscis Austrinus, the \"Southern Fish.\" — Jamie Carter September is a month of change in the night sky, with the stars of fall emerging as the stars of spring and summer descend. Look to the northeast after dark, about two hours after sunset tonight, and you'll see the yellow star Capella, one of the brightest stellar bodies visible from the Northern Hemisphere. It's the most prominent star in Auriga, \"The Charioteer,\" found beneath Perseus and Cassiopeia in September. Capella shines at the same brightness as Arcturus, in Boötes, a star of spring that's setting in the west in early October. You can find Arcturus by going \"arc to Arcturus\" using the handle of stars in the Big Dipper to travel in a west-northwest direction. You can find Capella by tracing a line through the top two stars of the bowl of four stars in the Big Dipper and continuing across the horizon to the northeast. — Jamie Carter Tonight, a 98%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon — just a day from being the full “Harvest Moon” — will shine just 3.5 degrees to the upper-left of Saturn. Having reached opposition a couple of weeks ago, Saturn is as big and bright as it ever gets, though to see its rings, you’ll need a small telescope. Although you can’t see Neptune, it’s just to the left of Saturn, forming an equilateral triangle with it and the moon. — Jamie Carter Although it forms one-third of the Summer Triangle, the star Altair often gets overlooked in favour of brighter Vega and the supergiant Deneb. However, at just 17 light-years from the solar system, it's one of the closest naked-eye stars visible from the Northern Hemisphere. The brightest star in the small constellation Aquila, \"The Eagle,\" is flanked by Tarazed and Alshain, which together form the eagle's head. — Jamie Carter Tonight offers a chance to explore Cygnus, \"The Swan,\" the largest constellation that forms part of the Summer Triangle asterism. The bright star Deneb, positioned at the top of the elongated Summer Triangle high above the western horizon tonight after dark, is one of the most distant stars visible to the naked eye, at around 1,600 light-years from the solar system. It marks the tail of the swan while Albireo, a colorful double star in the center of the Summer Triangle, represents the bird's head. — Jamie Carter A prominent star high in the western sky after dark tonight, Vega is part of the Summer Triangle, a vast asterism formed by Vega and two other bright stars, Altair (to the left of Vega) and Deneb (above Vega). It remains a prominent sight in the southwestern sky after sunset, but it's now sinking into the western horizon late at night. A mere 25 light-years away, Vega is part of the small constellation Lyra, \"The Harp.\" — Jamie Carter Today there's a first-quarter moon, where half of the moon's Earth-facing side is lit by direct sunlight. Until tonight, there's been a waxing crescent moon gradually growing in illumination and brightness, and sinking into the western horizon a little later each night. That will now ramp up as the moon becomes a waxing gibbous moon, brightening each night until it reaches its full phase in a week's time. — Jamie Carter The waxing crescent moon, now 23%-illuminated, will move into the constellation Scorpius tonight. Look for the lunar disk in the western sky at sunset, with its shadowed regions lit by Earthshine (sunlight reflected from Earth's oceans, clouds and ice onto the moon). It will sit to the lower right of the three stars that represent the head of the great scorpion in the constellation Scorpius — Acrab (top), Dschubba (middle) and Pi Scorpii (bottom). Dschubba, also called Delta Sco, is the brightest. — Jamie Carter The waxing crescent moon, now 31%-illuminated, will appear just three degrees to the left of the bright star Antares in the southwestern sky after sunset tonight. Often called the \"heart of the scorpion\", Antares is the brightest star in a binary star system about 555 light-years from Earth. — Jamie Carter Hopefully, you've had a chance to see the spiral arms of our galaxy, the Milky Way, arc above you in the night sky this summer. Now you get the chance to see another naked eye galaxy! It takes some practice, but it's relatively easy; first find the W-shaped constellation of Cassiopeia above northwest, and locate the star at the tip of the right-hand \"V.\" Use that V as an arrow that points at the next bright star going in a diagonal line to the horizon — that's Mirach. About two-thirds of the way along that journey is Andromeda, the farthest object it's possible to see with the naked eye at 2.5 million light-years. — Jamie Carter The waxing crescent moon, now 15%-illuminated, will shine tonight with Mars to its lower-right and Antares, the brightest star in the constellation Scorpius, to its upper-left. Mars sometimes passes close to Antares — as proven tonight — and consequently the two can be easily mistaken for one another in the night sky. The name Antares is derived from the ancient Greek phrase \"rival to Mars\", with Mars being the Roman name for the Greek god of war Ares — Jamie Carter The waxing crescent moon, now 9%-illuminated, will appear close to Mars tonight and be much easier to see than last night. Be outside looking south-southwest after sunset for the pair, which will sink swiftly below the horizon. After a year featuring lots of moon-Mars close conjunctions, this is the final show, as Mars is now transitioning out of the post-sunset night sky. — Jamie Carter Fresh from eclipsing the sun from the point of view of some lucky southern hemisphere skywatchers, the moon will tonight have edged just far enough from the glare of our star for Earthlings to see it once again just after sunset. Just 4%-illuminated, the waxing crescent moon will be a tough find, but may be visible just above the west-southwest after sunset. — Jamie Carter Another early start beckons for stargazers after two wondrous sights in one (admittedly early) sky-watching session. A super-slim 2%-illuminated waning crescent moon will rise in the east-northeast about 90 minutes before sunrise. Not only will Venus and Regulus shine above it — this time with the planet just below the star — but it may also be possible to see a triangular glow of light in the east called zodiacal light. The phenomenon, sometimes known as a \"false dawn\", arises when sunlight reflects off interplanetary dust orbiting the sun along the plane of the solar system. It makes for a spectacular sight, but is only visible from very dark sky destinations. — Jamie Carter With just one day remaining until the new moon, it's a fabulous night for stargazing, but the highlight is something virtually immune to light pollution of all kinds — Saturn at opposition. Though a view of its fabulous rings (albeit virtually side-on this year) demands at least a small telescope, Saturn will rise in the east around sunset and set in the west around sunrise. That's the beauty of it being at opposition — when Earth gets between it and the sun — as well as it looking its biggest, brightest and best in 2025. It will shine at magnitude 0.6. The moon will reach its new phase today at 2:54 p.m. EST. During this time, the moon is positioned roughly between the Earth and the sun, making its illuminated side invisible from Earth. It means dark skies that are perfect for stargazing — and it also causes a partial solar eclipse to be seen in some parts of the globe (though that will be seen tomorrow, local time). — Jamie Carter For those in New Zealand, the South Pacific and Antarctica, a partial solar eclipse happens close to sunrise today, local time. Visible only from the Southern Hemisphere, a big eclipsed sunrise will be seen from New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga. You can follow along with a livestream starting at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Sept. 21 showing real-time views of the eclipse courtesy of Time and Date. During the event, as much as 79% of the sun will be blocked by the moon. Then on Sept. 22 we mark the equinox, which occurs at 2:20 p.m. EDT (1820 GMT), heralding the onset of Autumn in the northern hemisphere — Jamie Carter Are you ready for the naked eye sight of the month? If you got up early yesterday to see the crescent moon, persuade yourself to repeat the process. Your reward will be a spectacular conjunction of a 6%-illuminated waning crescent moon with Venus and Regulus. The three will align incredibly closely, with a mere half a degree between them. Look to the east-northeast horizon about an hour before sunrise. — Jamie Carter It's at this time of the year that the Milky Way's core puts on its final good show for skywatchers in the Northern Hemisphere. It's visible in the south-southwest immediately after it gets dark for those with both dark skies and a little patience, with its glowing ribbon of stars dust and gas running through the vast Summer Triangle asterism — specifically from Deneb to Altair — and down to the horizon. For a best-ever, jaw-dropping view of the bright core of the Milky Way, go to dark regions of the Southern Hemisphere (outback Australia, Southern Africa, southern South America, or a Pacific island) in July and August, from where the center of the Milky Way's core will be visible stretching straight up above you. — Jamie Carter An 11%-illuminated waning crescent moon will appear directly above bright Venus before sunrise on Sept. 18, blazing away at magnitude -3.9 just a few short days ahead of its new moon phase. Look closely at Venus and you'll notice that there's a bright star just below it. That's Regulus, the brightest star in the constellation Leo. It's also the ideal morning to witness the Earthshine phenomenon, as sunlight reflected from Earth bounces onto the lunar surface. — Jamie Carter It may be a famous constellation, but Pisces, \"the fishes,\" is not easy to find. It's made up largely of faint stars and demands a dark September night and some patience. However, with those in hand, it's relatively easy to find the core part of it, particularly because this year, Saturn can be used as a guiding light. Look east after dark and find Saturn in the south — it will be the \"star\" with a constant light, unlike the others, that will flicker. Look directly above Saturn at five (though some say seven) stars in an oval shape. That's the Circlet of Pisces. — Jamie Carter On Sept. 16, a 28%-illuminated waning crescent moon will be easily visible in the pre-dawn sky close to three bright points of light. To its lower right will be bright Jupiter, with the two bright stars of the constellation Gemini on its left side. To the moon's lower left will be orangey Pollux (34 light-years from the solar system), while to its upper left will be yellowy Castor (51 light-years). Together, they'll create the illusion of a rhomboid shape, with each object about four degrees apart. — Jamie Carter Most stargazers focus on watching moonrise only on the night of the full moon, but it can be a spectacular sight for many nights afterwards. Tonight, about an hour before midnight, the 64%-illuminated waning gibbous moon will rise just below and to the left of the Pleiades star cluster in the constellation Taurus. Catch the moon as it rises to see it glow in golden-orange hues. — Jamie Carter For those lucky enough to have a clear view of the west-southwest horizon, a lovely sight awaits just after sunset when Mars and Spica sink together. Although the timing will have to be precise because they'll sink in the gathering twilight shortly after sunset, reddish Mars will be just above right of blueish Spica, the brightest star in the constellation Virgo. — Jamie Carter The moon will reach its last quarter phase today, meaning 50% of its Earth-facing side will be lit by the sun. The line across the middle of the lunar surface — known as the terminator — creates shadows and brings craters into view. However, for stargazers, tonight marks the beginning of the moon's rise after midnight, followed by a decrease in illumination, creating ideal conditions for skywatching and astronomy. — Jamie Carter Tonight offers a good opportunity to locate the iconic, almost ever-present constellation Cassiopeia, \"The Queen.\" A circumpolar constellation that appears to revolve around Polaris, the North Star, it's now rising higher into the sky at night. It begins as an \"E\" shape above northeast and rises higher in the north as an \"M\" shape. It's always opposite the Big Dipper, whose position is easy to recall with the memory aid \"spring up, fall down.\" For Cassiopeia, it's \"fall up, spring down.\" — Jamie Carter It's a common phrase, but can you see the \"Man in the Moon?\" It refers to the blunt image of dark patches on the lunar surface that, to the naked and untrained eye, make the moon's Earth-facing side resemble the eyes, nose and mouth of a human face. The eyes and mouth are, of course, basalt plains on the moon known as maria. It's all a form of Pareidolia — the human tendency to look for patterns where they don't exist. — Jamie Carter The full \"Corn Moon\" may have passed, but tonight presents yet another grand view, as a 97%-illuminated waning gibbous moon sits close to Saturn in the constellation Pisces. The pairing will be visible throughout the night, with Neptune lurking between the two — though the ice giant will be too dim to see with the naked eye. With its annual opposition on Sept. 20, Saturn is now close to its brightest and best in 2025. — Jamie Carter A couple of hours before sunrise on Sept. 9 is the peak of the ε-Perseid meteor shower, a lesser-known display of about five “shooting stars” per hour from the Perseus constellation, according to In-The-Sky.org. It’s not worth planning an early start for it, but if you’re up anyway doing astronomy, it’s worth knowing about. Later in the day, after sunset, the now 92%-illuminated waning gibbous moon continues its appearance near Saturn in the constellation Pisces throughout the night, though tonight there’s a much wider separation between the two. — Jamie Carter Today, we celebrate the 48th launch anniversary of NASA's Voyager 1 mission, which lifted off aboard a Titan-Centaur rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Sept. 5, 1977, destined to expand humanity's understanding of the solar system and the greater universe beyond. The spacecraft is now over 23 light-hours away (the time it takes for a message to be relayed to and from it), but can you find its approximate location in the night sky? Voyager 1 is currently in the constellation Ophiuchus, very close to that vast summer constellation's bright star Rasalhague, which forms a diamond shape with the three bright stars of the famous \"Summer Triangle\" asterism now high in the western sky. Ophiuchus is recognised as the 13th zodiac sign because the sun passes through it for a portion of the year. — Jamie Carter As darkness descends, look due east for the appearance of the Great Square of Pegasus, a prominent asterism — or formation of stars — in the night sky that's not part of an official constellation. The Great Square is the core of the constellation Pegasus and is comprised of four obvious corner stars — Scheat, Alpheratz, Markab and Algenib. Its appearance in the east signals the changing of the seasons and the coming of the southward equinox, now just two weeks away. — Jamie Carter September's full moon is often called the Harvest Moon, but not this month. The crucial date is that of the southward equinox, which occurs on Sept. 22 this year. The closest full moon to the equinox gets the moniker \"Harvest Moon,\" which this year goes to October's full moon on Oct. 7. That leaves September's full moon with the fill-in name \"Corn Moon.\" Either way, it will be best seen rising at moonrise in the east this evening, shortly after sunset. Those in parts of Asia, Australia and the Pacific will see a total lunar eclipse as the moon passes entirely through Earth's deepest shadow to take on a deep reddish hue for 82 minutes, a phenomenon known as a \"blood moon.\" Those in Europe and Africa will see it eclipsed as it rises, though it likely won't be noticeable to most. None of the eclipse will be seen from North or South America. — Jamie Carter Look due west after sunset, and you'll see Arcturus close to the horizon. It's the brightest star in the constellation Boötes, which at this time of year looks like a Y-shape — or a cocktail glass — extending above Arcturus. The red giant star is located some 37 light-years from our solar system and is the fourth-brightest star in the night sky. With a low view of the northwestern horizon, you can still just about make the famous star-hop by following the curve of stars in the handle of the Big Dipper, due north, to go in an \"arc to Arcturus.\" There's a mythological link, too; the Big Dipper is part of the constellation Ursa Major, \"The Great Bear,\" with the name Arcturus meaning \"Guardian of the Bear.\" — Jamie Carter Mars is now way past its best and will be behind the sun by January. You can still see it, however, low on the west-southwest horizon shortly after sunset, shining to the right of the bright star Spica in the constellation Virgo. Today is the 49th landing anniversary of Viking 2, one of the first NASA spacecraft to touch down on the Martian surface. It set down in Utopia Planitia near the edge of the Martian polar ice cap. Viking 1 landed on July 20 and sent back the first image of the Martian surface. Mars will next reach its bright opposition — when it swings close to Earth — on Feb. 19, 2027. — Jamie Carter If you watched last month's \"planet parade\", you'll have seen Mercury make a spectacular appearance alongside Venus and Jupiter. Its apparent journey to and from the sun's glare — from our point of view of Earth — is now on the wane, with an hour before sunrise today being the best time to be in position to see the \"Swift Planet's\" final appearance, close to bright star Regulus in the constellation Leo. Regulus will be just to the lower-right of Mercury. Be quick because both will fade long before sunrise. — Jamie Carter August is prime time to view the constellation Sagittarius, which lies across the busiest section of the Milky Way from the point of view of the solar system — the galactic center point. Dense starfields and nebulas abound in this part of the sky, but the easiest shape of stars to see resembles a teapot. Look to the southern horizon a few hours after sunset, and you'll see eight stars just to the left of the brightest part of the Milky Way, resembling a handle, teapot and spout. The teapot tips forward slightly, with the Milky Way acting as steam rising from its spout. — Jamie Carter Low on the southwest horizon, about 45 minutes after dark, you'll find a big, bright, waxing crescent moon just shy of its plump first quarter phase. It will be just to the lower-right of Antares, the brightest star in the summer constellation Scorpius, \"The Scorpion.\" — Jamie Carter Rise at the latest an hour before sunrise and cast your eyes to the eastern horizon. You'll see a neat equilateral triangle with Jupiter at the top, the bright star Procyon at the bottom-right and super-bright Venus at the bottom-left. If the sky is dark enough and your eyesight is sharp, you'll notice a fuzzy patch on the left-hand side of Venus, close to the planet. That's the Beehive Cluster (M44), an open cluster of about 1,000 stars and one of the nearest to the solar system. Take along a pair of binoculars for the best view. — Jamie Carter Aug. 31 was the best time to catch Venus at its closest to the Beehive Cluster (M44) in the constellation Cancer, but about an hour and a half before sunrise on Sept. 1, the sight will still impress low on the east-northeast horizon. Shining at magnitude -3.9, Venus will be blazingly bright and easy to spot, though a pair of binoculars will make it easier to spot M44. From about an hour before sunrise, you may see Mercury rise into view at magnitude -2, with Venus equidistant between it and Jupiter at magnitude -1.4 above and to the east. — Jamie Carter If you have seen any \"shooting stars\" this season, there's a good chance that they will have been Perseids, which, as their name suggests, appeared to streak away from a point of origin located in the ancient constellation Perseus, \"The Hero.\" Rising in the northeast is the W-shape of the constellation Cassiopeia as darkness falls. The most famous shape in Perseus is a curve of stars called the Segment of Perseus, with the bright star Miram in its center. Most of the stars in Perseus are in the Perseus Moving Group (also called the Alpha Persei Cluster), which is about 570 light-years from the solar system. — Jamie Carter Look to the southwest about 45 minutes after dark, and low on the horizon, you'll find a 21%-illuminated waxing crescent moon. To its right will be Spica, and beyond that, Mars. Look high above for the Big Dipper (The Plough), identifying the four stars that form its handle. Follow then in a curve to the next bright star — Arcturus in the constellation Boötes, which will be directly above Spica and Mars. You've just performed one of the most famous star-hops in stargazing — \"Arc to Arcturus, spike to Spica.\" — Jamie Carter Look to the southwest to see the 14%-illuminated waxing crescent moon shine with Mars on its right and the bright star Spica on its left. Spica, the brightest star in the constellation Virgo, is 250 light-years from the solar system. — Jamie Carter Look due west about 30 minutes after the sun sets, and you may see one of the most delicate signs in all nature — a young moon. Just 8%-illuminated, a waxing crescent moon will shine just below and to the right of Mars. Although the red planet is still visible after sunset, it's now faint. — Jamie Carter It's August. The moon is down. That can mean only one thing. It's peak Milky Way season! Our home galaxy will look its very best tonight, with no moonlight in the sky. It's also at its most dramatic and convenient, visible, arcing from high in the southeast to the southern horizon, with the brightest part — the core, or galactic center point — low on the southern horizon. If you're struggling to see it, that's because you're looking at light-polluted skies. Get away from city lights — about 25 miles (40 km) south, where the southern horizon is dark — and you'll see it. Any newish smartphone boasting a \"night mode\" can take a decent image of the Milky Way, but do keep it still, either by using a tripod or simply resting it on something like a gatepost or table. — Jamie Carter Related: Black Moon darkens August skies — here's how to hunt sparking wonders in the Milky Way this weekend There's not much to see, but today, the moon reaches its new phase, slipping roughly between Earth and the sun to get lost in the glare of our star for a day or two. It will emerge as a crescent in the evenings to come. This month, the new moon has a special name — a \"black moon.\" It's purely an astronomical term for the third new moon in a season with four new moons. Strictly speaking, it's a \"seasonal black moon.\" Related: A rare Black Moon rises with the sun on Aug. 23: Here's what to expect Can you see a black moon? No — not this year — but it is possible during a solar eclipse when its silhouette is visible in eclipse glasses. That's exactly what happens one lunar year (12 orbits of the moon around the sun — 354 days) from today, when the next total solar eclipse on Earth is visible from Greenland, Iceland and Spain on Aug. 12, 2026. More importantly, with the \"black moon\" out of the sky altogether, it's a chance to take advantage of the increased hours of darkness to go stargazing. — Jamie Carter You'll never see Pluto with the naked eye. Or with a telescope, for that matter, unless it's incredibly powerful. However, it's useful to know where it is in the sky, and today is a good excuse, for 19 years ago — on Aug. 26, 2006 — the International Astronomical Union voted to approve a new definition of \"planet\" that excluded Pluto. Since then, it's been known as a dwarf planet. The discovery of a similarly sized body, Eris, prompted re-evaluation — and ultimately reclassification — of Pluto, hence the vote. Look high in the southeast just after dark for the Summer Triangle, that vast elongated asterism of three bright stars — Deneb and Vega at the top and Altair at the bottom. Come down to the horizon from Altair. About two-thirds of the way through that journey is the approximate position of Pluto. Since it takes 248 years to orbit the sun, its position doesn't change much from year to year. — Jamie Carter Head away from city lights and look high above the southern horizon a couple of hours after sunset on Aug. 21 to find the three stars of the famous 'Summer Triangle' asterism astride the Milky Way. Altair — the brightest star in the constellation Aquila — can be seen twinkling to the left of the Milky way, closest to the horizon, with bright Vega visible to its upper right on the other side of the galactic ribbon of stars, dust and gas. Deneb, the tail of the swan represented by the constellation Cygnus, will be visible embedded in the glowing band of the Milky Way to Vega's left, completing the cosmic triangle. It's going to be a challenging sight that requires a very clear eastern horizon and excellent timing, but how often do three exquisite celestial sights align in the night sky? If you can get some binoculars on Mercury as it rises (start looking about an hour before sunrise), look just above it for a sparkling clump of stars — the Beehive Cluster. Above and to the left of that will be an incredibly delicate, 4%-illuminated waning crescent moon. Thursday marks the eighth anniversary of the \"Great American Eclipse,\" a total solar eclipse that crossed the U.S. on Aug. 21, 2017. That day, the NASA website's live broadcast got more than 50 million views and almost 31 million unique views on Facebook. The next one in the U.S. is on Aug. 23, 2044, in Montana and North Dakota. That's just 19 years from this Saturday! — Jamie Carter If you're going to rise early once this month, make it today because in the east, an hour before sunrise, the \"planet parade\" peaks. You can look for Mercury beneath and Jupiter above, but your eyes will be drawn to what's between the two — a spectacularly slender 9%-illuminated waning crescent moon next to bright Venus. Look just to the left of the moon and you'll see Pollux, one of the \"twins\" in the constellation Gemini. Just above it, you'll find its \"brother,\" Castor. — Jamie Carter You may have glimpsed it already, but summer 2025's \"planet parade\" now begins its grandest phase. Be up and looking east an hour before sunrise and you'll see a now 16%-illuminated waning crescent moon form a slight curve with Jupiter and Venus. Today, Mercury reaches what astronomers call the \"greatest elongation west,\" when the tiny \"Swift Planet\" reaches its farthest distance from the sun in the pre-dawn sky. — Jamie Carter The presence of a full moon this week has ruined the Perseid meteor shower's peak last Monday/Tuesday. Can we salvage anything? Perhaps. With the moon on the cusp of its last quarter phase, it won't rise until shortly before midnight. That gives sky-watchers a little time in dark skies to see what remains of the 100-or-so \"shooting stars\" that were buzzing around last Monday. You can look anywhere in the night sky, but know that the source constellation, Perseus, is rising in the northeast after sunset. Any \"shooting stars\" you do see are grains of dust left in the inner solar system by comet Swift-Tuttle. — Jamie Carter A last quarter moon is an important waymarker for stargazers, and this month, that goes double. It marks the point in the moon's orbit when it wanes to being half-lit, with it shrinking to an ever-slimmer crescent over the next week. As well as leaving the skies darker when it is present, a last quarter moon rises at midnight and about 50 minutes later each night thereafter, clearing the evening skies of any natural light pollution. As luck would have it, the half-lit moon will tonight rise just a few degrees above the sparkling open cluster of stars known as the Pleiades, or \"Seven Sisters\" — a favorite of many stargazers — in the constellation Taurus, \"The Bull.\" — Jamie Carter Whisper it, but there's a must-see planetary conjunction building in the pre-dawn sky. Should you bother to get up for it? If you're only going to do so once, wait until Tuesday, Aug. 19, when the moon will be slimmer and Mercury will be highest — but if there's a clear sky forecast this morning, go for it. Your reward will be a 36%-illuminated waning crescent moon high above Jupiter, Venus and, closer to the eastern horizon, possibly Mercury. Be in place about an hour before sunrise. — Jamie Carter The \"planet parade\" gets even more impressive this morning before sunrise as a now 26%-illuminated waning crescent moon gets a little closer to Jupiter and Venus, with Mercury peeking above the eastern horizon as dawn approaches. Look for \"Earthshine\" on the crescent moon and, to the right of the planets, for the winter constellation of Orion \"The Hunter\" rising. Let the three stars in Orion's Belt point you towards the bright star Sirius on the east-northeast horizon. — Jamie Carter Some sights in the night sky are small but perfectly formed. Such an object is Brocchi's Cluster, also known as Collinder 399 and, more descriptively, as the Coathanger. Visible close to the Summer Triangle stars in the southeast after dark, Brocchi's Cluster does require dark skies, but it's more obvious than you might think. Almost exactly halfway between the bright stars Vega and Altair in the Summer Triangle, Brocchi's Cluster is about 10 easily visible stars in the shape of — you guessed it — a coat hanger, complete with hook. Just bear in mind that the coat hanger is upside down as viewed from the Northern Hemisphere. — Jamie Carter One of the smallest but oldest-named constellations, Sagitta, \"The Arrow,\" is found between the bright stars Deneb and Altair (but much closer to the latter) in the Summer Triangle asterism high in the southeast after dark. It's only four stars, but they're arranged in a dramatic arrow shape that's unmistakable. It points towards the northern horizon. — Jamie Carter. It's a shame, but tonight's peak of the annual Perseid meteor shower isn't going to provide many \"shooting stars.\" Although there can be as many as 100 per hour in the darkest hours of the peak night, a waning gibbous moon — about 91%-illuminated — will rise in the east just as it gets dark and will shine brightly for the rest of the night. That will bleach the sky and make the Perseids hard to see, but the brightest ones should still be visible. Be outside just before midnight and stand with your back to the bright moon for the best chance. — Jamie Carter In what has to be one of the celestial highlights of August, the two brightest planets in the solar system will come to within a degree of each other in the pre-dawn sky. Look to the east-northeast for the fabulous sight of the second and fifth planets from the sun appearing just a width of an outstretched finger apart. Be in place an hour before sunrise where you are to see the two brightest planets shine side by side — it's not something that happens too often. By the way, you'll hear lots of stories about six planets being \"in alignment\" this morning from people who have no idea what alignment means. Yes, Uranus is in the sky (high above Jupiter and Venus), and Neptune is close to Saturn beside the 89%-illuminated moon, but it's not an alignment — the planets all orbit on the same path through the sky, known as the ecliptic (the plane of the solar system). It's like saying cars align with each other on a road! — Jamie Carter If you've been watching the sky for some time, you'll have seen a full moon appear on the eastern horizon during dusk. It's an exquisite sight, but exactly which night to look can be tricky to tell in advance. The effect looks best when the full moon appears about 20 minutes after sunset, when the surrounding landscape is still slightly aglow from the recently set sun. That perfect time is tomorrow, but tonight, the almost full moon will rise almost simultaneously with the sunset. So get yourself a clear view of the eastern horizon and see summer's second full moon appear in a muted orange. Then come back tomorrow for a second helping — and a subtly different view. — Jamie Carter Read more: August full moon 2025 rises this weekend: Here's how to see the stunning 'Sturgeon Moon' At 3:56 a.m. EDT today, the moon will be 100%-illuminated by the sun and be at its full phase while in the constellation Capricornus, \"The Goat.\" Although the conditions were good last night to watch an almost full moonrise, there's a second chance tonight. With the moon rising in the east about half an hour after sunset, the landscape should still be visible as a bright orange orb appears. Expect a dramatic sight. — Jamie Carter The Summer Triangle is an anchor of the seasonal night sky. Dominating the southeastern sky immediately after dark, its three bright stars — Deneb, Vega and Altair — can help stargazers navigate all summer long. Altair, in particular, can also act as a signpost to several night sky sights you could otherwise easily miss. One is a very tiny but beautiful constellation called Delphinus, \"The Dolphin.\" Found just to the left of Altair soon after dark at this time of year, Delphinus is formed from five stars clustered close together, with the four making an unmistakable diamond shape. — Jamie Carter The heliacal rising of a star is the date when it first becomes visible in the east just before dawn, having previously been visible in the west just after sunset. For the brightest star in the night sky, Sirius, its heliacal rising holds an important place in human culture, and specifically in ancient Egypt, where it marked the beginning of a new year. The exact date you can see Sirius swap from the evening sky to the morning sky will depend on where you live. According to data from Sky & Telescope, subtract your latitude from 29 to get the date in August. For example, if you live at 50 degrees north, it's Aug. 21, while those at 40 degrees north will see Sirius before sunrise for the first time this year on Aug. 11. It will appear on the east-southeast horizon, with the three stars of a vertical Orion's Belt pointing straight down at it. — Jamie Carter The fourth brightest star in the nighttime sky, Arcturus, is the brightest in the constellation Boötes, \"The Plowman.\" Its name means \"Guardian of the Bear\" in Greek because it's close to the Big Dipper/The Plough. This month, you can find it high above the western horizon. Relatively close to Earth at 37 light-years away, Arcturus sits at the bottom of a pattern of stars in the Boötes constellation that looks like a champagne flute. — Jamie Carter Having found Vega earlier this week, now look for Deneb, a bright star in the southeast that's the top-left corner of the Summer Triangle asterism. One of the most distant stars visible to the naked eye, Deneb, is approximately 1,500 light-years from the solar system. So why is it visible at all? A blue-white supergiant around 200 times larger than the sun, it's one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way galaxy. — Jamie Carter Jupiter is currently shining in the pre-dawn sky just below Venus. Although it's a fine sight to the naked eye, put any pair of binoculars on the giant planet and its four large moons suddenly appear as points of light, just as they did to Galileo in 1610 when he put the first astronomical telescope up to his eye. Jupiter and its moons are currently being investigated by NASA's Juno probe, which was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, on Aug. 5, 2011 — exactly 14 years ago. Juno has been at Jupiter since 2016 and has made discoveries ranging from cyclones to Io's flowing magma. However, this is the last launch anniversary we can happily celebrate because Juno is scheduled to end its mission on September 15, 2025. Will it get an extended mission? In normal times, yes, but if Trump's 2026 budget call does slash NASA funding by 24%, Juno may end its mission prematurely. — Jamie Carter Stargazers often look for constellations and asterisms (shapes), but what about stars? If the constellations are just imaginary shapes in the night sky, the stars are real — the anchors and signposts — and not only do they look different, but many of them have names as old as human culture. Arguably, the most important star in the night sky is Vega, an anchor star of summer. A mere 25 light-years from the solar system, it's part of the Summer Triangle asterism in the southeast after dark. It's assigned zero magnitude because all other stars' brightness is measured relative to it. The second brightest in the Northern Hemisphere, Vega was the first to be photographed in 1850 and was imaged by the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes in 2024. — Jamie Carter Venus has dominated the post-sunset and, more recently, the pre-dawn night skies for all of 2025 so far. Its apparition as the bright \"Morning Star\" — as stargazers call it when it's visible before sunrise — peaks tonight as it reaches its highest altitude in the morning sky while in the hand of Orion, \"The Hunter.\" Exactly how high it is will depend on where you are, but it's the easiest time to see Venus in the east before dawn this year. It will now wane, eventually passing around the back of the sun on Jan. 6, 2026, as it reaches superior solar conjunction. — Jamie Carter Since it reached first quarter phase, when half of its Earth-facing side appears lit as seen from our planet, the moon is now brightening the sky and making faint stars hard to see. However, it's a great time to see Maria (lunar \"seas\" of ancient lava in impact craters) on the moon. The most prominent are Mare Serenitatis (Sea of Serenity) and Mare Tranquillitatis (Sea of Tranquility), with three smaller maria beneath them: Mare Nectaris (Sea of Nectar), Mare Fecunditatis (Sea of Fertility) and Mare Crisium (Sea of Crises). — Jamie Carter The moon has been passing close to Antares — the brightest star in the Scorpius constellation — on every orbit this year, and tonight it will pass directly beneath it. Antares is one of four bright stars the moon regularly passes close to and occasionally occults, the others being Aldebaran in Taurus, Regulus in Leo and Spica in Virgo. That's because they lie near the ecliptic, which closely matches the moon's path through the sky. The close conjunctions and occultations occur in a predictable, repeating series over several years as part of the 18.6-year-long lunar cycle. — Jamie Carter If you've been thinking about Apollo 11 this month, 11 nights on from the 56th anniversary of its mission, it's finally a good night to look for where it landed on the moon. Anytime after sunset tonight, look at the now 39%-lit waxing crescent moon, more specifically at the terminator. Right in the middle of the moon, to the right of the terminator, is a dark patch — that's an ancient lava field called Mare Tranquillitatis — the Sea of Tranquility — where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed at 9:41 p.m. EDT on July 20, 1969. — Jamie Carter Related: Discover where the Eagle might have landed: How to find Apollo 11's backup sites on the moon The waxing crescent moon is such a beautiful sight for skywatchers during the week after a new moon. However, while watching its face gradually be revealed by sunlight is a treat, the moon also conducts a guided tour of some of the night sky's brightest stars. Drop in on the tour tonight, when it will hang just a degree or so from Spica, the brightest star in the constellation Virgo. Spica, a blue-white binary star, is 250 light-years from the solar system. Expect up to 20 \"shooting stars\" per hour at the peak of the Delta Aquariids tonight. The result of debris left in the inner solar system by comet Marsden and comet Kracht, an early-setting waxing crescent, should mean decent viewing conditions. As a bonus, it's also the peak night for the Alpha Capricornids, which promise another 5-10 \"shooting stars\" per hour. The farther south you are, the more meteors you're likely to see. If you want to get your eyes on something few other skywatchers ever do, be outside looking west immediately after sunset. On offer is a 2%-illuminated waxing crescent moon, just a day past its new moon phase. It will be very close to the northwestern horizon, so you'll need a low view (and a cloudless horizon), as well as a pair of binoculars. — Jamie Carter If yesterday's sight of a super-slender crescent moon was a difficult catch, tonight's is slightly easier and likely more rewarding. Tonight, the moon will be 6%-illuminated and a little easier to see, but it's what's nearby that will make it really special. Look about two degrees to the right of the moon, and you'll see the bright star Regulus, shining at 1.3 magnitude. The brightest star in the constellation Leo, \"The Lion,\" Regulus, is over 70 light-years from the solar system. — Jamie Carter Higher in the west after sunset than it was last night, an 11%-illuminated waxing crescent moon will shine, with Mars to its upper left. The mostly dark face of the moon will catch Earth's reflected glow, giving it a faint shine. According to NASA, an astronaut standing on the moon at this time would see a spectacular, fully lit Earth, with the lunar surface around subtly lit by Earthshine, just as dark nights on Earth are lit by the light of the full moon. The phenomenon is easiest to see about three mornings before and the evenings after the new moon. — Jamie Carter Very early this morning, we see the peak of a minor meteor shower, the Piscis Austrinids. Expect about five meteors per hour, according to In-The-Sky.org. Come back many hours later, about 45 minutes after sunset, and look west for the lovely sight of a 19% waxing crescent moon to the left of Mars. It's all that remains of the stunning \"planet parades\" of February and March. The two solar system bodies will be separated by about a degree — the width of your little finger held against the sky. — Jamie Carter With a new moon tonight, there's no moonlight or distractions, so use the darkness well and find one of the oldest known naked-eye stars. A yellow dwarf like our sun, Mu Cassiopeia A is a whopping 12.7 billion years old. It's actually one star in a visual binary star system (also called a double star) called Marfak in the constellation Cassiopeia. Look for it above the north-northeast horizon tonight by first identifying the W-shape of Cassiopeia. Use the four outside stars of Cassiopeia and connect them towards the horizon to make a larger V-shape with a brighter star below — that's Marfak. Fittingly, its name means \"the elbow.\" — Jamie Carter Here's a challenging one — but it will be worth the effort. This morning, rising in the east-northeast but never getting far from the horizon in twilight, a slender 3%-illuminated waning crescent moon will shine close to Jupiter. This is the final morning it's possible to see it before it heads into the glare of the sun to become a new moon. The moon at this stage of its orbit is typically very hard to pick out with the naked eye. However, using Jupiter as a guardrail will help. Locate the giant planet, shining at -1.8 magnitude, and look just to its left. They'll be about five degrees apart. You'll need a clear horizon. — Jamie Carter The waning crescent moon will have moved another 12 degrees east on its journey around Earth this morning. By now, it's close to the sun's glare, so low in the east and just 7%-illuminated. This final Earthshine morning will be the best, with the slender nature of the lunar crescent and the delicate impact of Earth's reflected light making the moon a drop-dead gorgeous sight — but there's much more to see. The moon will hang between Venus, to its right, and Jupiter, beneath it. Snake your way upwards from Jupiter to the moon, across to Venus and beyond to bright star Aldebaran in Taurus before heading up to the beautiful Pleiades. Now, head back to the horizon directly below the Pleiades and Aldebaran, and you may see Orion's belt shooting up. Six of the night sky's most beautiful and brightest objects in one (albeit early!) stargazing session! — Jamie Carter Prominent in the southeast right after dark and drifting across the south overnight is the Summer Triangle, a classic asterism that provides a staging post to swing the Milky Way. However, one of the Summer Triangle's bright stars, Deneb at top-left, is the lynchpin of the constellation Cygnus, \"The Swan.\" Deneb is the tail of the swan, with Albireo in the center of the Summer Triangle as its head. Native American cultures see the same shape as a salamander, a crane and a skeleton bird. — Jamie Carter Having familiarised yourself with the Cygnus constellation last night, take a look at it again and see something completely different. This time, you're looking for a cross-shape, and all you need to do is ignore some of the wing stars of Cygnus, then turn the entire shape upside down in your head. With Deneb at the top and Albireo at the bottom. It's oddly not as famous as the Southern Cross in the Southern Hemisphere, but the Northern Cross is much larger and easier to find. It's worth considering the rarity of both of the major stars; Deneb is one of the farthest stars that can be seen with the naked eye at 2,600 light-years distant from the solar system, while Albireo is a double star — one yellow-orange and one blue — though they're not visible to the naked eye. — Jamie Carter Here comes the sky-watching highlight of the month. Rise early this morning and look to the east-northeast about 45 minutes before sunrise for the spectacular conjunction of the moon and an open cluster of stars, and on an auspicious day for space exploration. A 24%-illuminated waning crescent moon will shine within the Pleiades, also known as M45 and the Seven Sisters. As you look at Earthshine lighting up the dark portion of the moon, including its Sea of Tranquility, think of the monumental achievement of NASA's Apollo 11 mission. On this day in 1969, at 3:17 p.m. EDT, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to land on and walk on the lunar surface. \"Houston, Tranquility Base here,\" said Armstrong. \"The Eagle has landed.\" — Jamie Carter If you can get up early this morning, on offer is the beautiful sight of a 15%-illuminated waning crescent moon close to Venus. The planet will shine brightly at -3.9 magnitude to the lower right of the moon. Look to the east about 45 minutes before sunrise. Aldebaran, the brightest star in Taurus, will be close by, forming a star-planet-moon equilateral triangle. It's another Earthshine morning, with Earth's reflected light clearly visible on the unlit portion of the moon. — Jamie Carter Rising around midnight tonight will be a last-quarter moon when the lunar surface appears half-lit from Earth. It's the starting gun for 10 nights of dark, moonless evening skies, which kicks off with the first appearance of Perseid meteors. The most famous and one of the most prolific meteor showers of the year, the Perseids, will this year likely disappoint on its peak night — August 11/12 — because of a recent full moon. So begin watching for shooting stars tonight and through the rest of July. Just don't expect the 100-per-hour rate possible on peak nights. It's one of the largest constellations in the night sky and visible for many months, but few stargazers know much about Ophiuchus, 'The Serpent Bearer.\" It's known as the 13th sign of the zodiac because, like the others, it's on the ecliptic, so the sun passes through it for 18 days from November 30. Between Scorpius and the Summer Triangle, the vast Ophiuchus constellation largely has faint stars, but its brightest star, Rasalhague, is easy to find — and can even be used to make the Summer Triangle into a Summer Diamond. Inside Ophiuchus — though not visible to the naked eye — is Barnard's Star, one of the closest stars to the sun at just six light-years distant. — Jamie Carter Look east around midnight tonight, and you’ll see a 70%-illuminated waning gibbous moon shining about two degrees above the planet Saturn. They’ll shine together all night. You won’t see it — it’s just beyond the capability of the human eye — but Neptune will be very close to Saturn. Saturn will come to its bright opposition on September 21, 2025, by which time its rings will have opened up slightly after being precisely side-on in March. From mid-northern latitudes, you're only likely to see the tail of Scorpius, \"The Scorpion,\" below which you'll see the bright red supergiant star Antares, which is also known as \"The Scorpion's Heart.\" Look above the southeastern horizon for the three stars that comprise its claws — Achrab, Dschubba and Fang. Shaula, a bright blue star that marks the Scorpion's tail, could go supernova at any time. At just 587 light-years distant, it's one of the closest supernova candidates. — Jamie Carter With the moon still bright, stick to bright stars when you're outside at night. A great target is one of the lesser-known stars of the Summer Triangle, that vast asterism visible in the southeast immediately after dark. Attention usually focuses on Deneb and Vega, marking the top of the triangle. Instead, focus on Altair at the bottom, which, as well as being the point of the Summer Triangle, is also the brightest star in the constellation Aquila, \"The Eagle.\" Altair is a mere 17 light-years distant. Flanking Altair is orangey Tarazed at 395 light-years and Alshain at 45 light-years, which collectively mark the head of the eagle. As a bonus, Aquila sits across the Milky Way; look below it for the richest, brightest core of our home galaxy. — Jamie Carter For weeks, Venus has been moving ever closer to the V-shape of stars that represents the core of the famous constellation Taurus, “The Bull.” This morning in the east, best viewed at least 45 minutes before sunrise, Earth’s sister planet will make its closest approach (about three degrees above) to the bright orange-yellow star Aldebaran. Above the pair will be the sparkling Pleiades open cluster of stars. Although this morning is the best time to view it, it will remain a notable sight until approximately July 18. Tonight, see the start of two minor meteor showers that combine to bring a steady stream of shooting stars to summer skies. Both the Delta Aquarid and Alpha Capricornid meteor showers begin tonight, both officially peaking on July 30, but in reality, any night in late July and early August is when you’ll see their prodigy. Today sees the rising of the first Summer full moon in the Northern Hemisphere. July's full moon has a few names, with its most popular in North America associated with the growth of new antlers on male buck deer. It's also called the Hay Moon and Thunder Moon. The moon will reach its full phase, which technically only lasts for a moment, at 4:37 p.m. EDT (2037 GMT). However, as always, the time to observe it will be as it appears on the southeastern horizon during dusk. Find out the exact time of moonrise where you are and be in a position to see it appear as a spectacular orange orb. As the night progresses, it will move into the southwestern sky, remaining remarkably low. That's because it's happening so soon after the Summer Solstice. Since the moon mirrors the sun, when the sun is high in the sky, the moon is low. From today through July 21, Venus will be as high in the pre-dawn night sky as it gets during its current apparition as the \"Morning Star.\" For this short time, it will be a genuine night-time object instead of the twilight sight it so often is. See it about 30 minutes before sunrise, and it will be around 25 degrees above the east-northeast horizon. It’s been lost in the sun's glare for the past few weeks and has effectively gone unseen since May, but this morning, the gas-giant planet will re-emerge into the pre-dawn morning sky. This morning, it will appear in the constellation Gemini and shine at magnitude -1.9, rising just before the sun (though if you want to see it, prepare for an “is that it?!” kinda view). Meanwhile, Venus will begin to shine above the east, just above Aldebaran in Taurus, getting closest on July 13. Jupiter won’t be an impressive object until mid-August. It will reach its bright opposition — when Earth briefly sits between it and the sun — on January 10, 2026. A waxing gibbous moon, now 92%-illuminated, will tonight shine in the southeastern sky about four degrees below Antares. A red supergiant star about 550 light-years from the solar system in the constellation Scorpius, \"the Scorpion,\" Antares translates to \"rival of Ares\" (Ares means Mars) because it sits close to the ecliptic, so the red planet passes close to it every few years. When that happens, they can be easily confused because Antares is a distinctive reddish color. However, there will be no confusion tonight because Mars will be on the opposite side of the sky in the west, in the constellation Leo. — Jamie Carter Although it was technically highest above the horizon on June 26 as seen from North America, today is when the \"Swift Planet\" Mercury is at its greatest elongation east. All that means is that Earth has a good view of Mercury as it appears to swing farthest from the sun from our point of view, in the evening sky. It's a view that has more to do with Earth's position in the solar system than Mercury's. It will shine at 0.5 magnitude, with Regulus in Leo and, beyond, Mars, to its upper left. — Jamie Carter Look to the northeast about an hour before sunrise, and you'll see the lovely sight of Venus, blazing away at -4.1 magnitude, close to the most beautiful open cluster of stars in the night sky, the Pleiades. Also called M45 and the Seven Sisters, it's bright because the light from its seven bright stars (and about 1,000 others) is shining on interstellar dust and causing a reflection nebula. Uranus is between Venus and the Pleiades, though at 5.8 magnitude, the eighth planet from the sun is too faint to see with the naked eye (and, besides, it's just a tiny blue dot even in a large telescope). — Jamie Carter Just as it did one lunar orbit ago, the moon, now an 86%-illuminated waxing gibbous, will shine close to the constellation Scorpius. It will approach its brightest star, giant Antares, on July 7, but tonight, it sits in the Scorpion's claws, three stars that trace out the celestial shape's pincers. Try to find the crescent of stars that make up the rest of the constellation. It's not that easy from mid-northern latitudes, where Scorpius rises in the east, moves along the southern horizon and sinks in the southwest. One reason of many to plan a stargazing trip to a more southerly location, or the Southern Hemisphere (though always plan to do that between last quarter moon and first quarter moon for dark moonless skies!). — Jamie Carter Go find your solar eclipse glasses. Is there an eclipse? No — the next one is on September 21, 2025, in the South Pacific, Antarctica and New Zealand. However, there is a reason for looking at the sun today. Earth is at what astronomers call aphelion, the point in its orbit at which it is furthest from the sun. Although it's only 1 arcminute smaller than at its perihelion (closest point) in January, it's a good excuse to look at the smallest possible sun in the daytime sky. Besides, you'll probably see sunspots. If you do, note where you think they are on the solar disk and compare them with the real-time HMI Intensitygram images of the sun from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, which are published every few minutes. — Jamie Carter Today at 2:31 p.m. EDT, the moon reaches its first quarter phase, when it will appear half-lit as seen from Earth and shine in the southwestern night sky. Look to its left and you'll see bright star Spica, the brightest star in the constellation Virgo. Come back tomorrow, and the moon will have waxed to 62%-illuminated and be much closer to Spica; this time, at it's lower-left. On either night, below the two, will be the little-known constellation Corus, \"The Crow.\" Its five main stars — Gienah, Kraz, Algorab, Minkar and Alchiba — should be relatively easy to find. — Jamie Carter Stargazing is best done little and often, typically in the early evening, which allows the new stars and constellations you learn to slowly sink in through repetition as the night sky gradually changes throughout the year. However, it is possible to cheat. Stay up until about 2:00 a.m. local time, and you'll see constellations rising that you otherwise wouldn't see for many weeks or months during the early evening. Rise at 2:00 a.m. tonight — perhaps while out camping in the balmy summer temperatures — and look east, and you'll see what is, in effect, the evening night sky for September, with the Great Square of Pegasus, an easy-to-recognise asterism, rising in the east below the Summer Triangle. — Jamie Carter Here's one more chance to see the crescent moon this month. Regaling the western horizon after dark tonight will be a now 33%-illuminated waxing crescent moon in an equidistant alignment with Mars and Regulus. Having pulled away from the brightest star in the constellation Leo, the red planet will gradually sink into the sun's glare, hanging on thanks to the lengthening nights but eventually disappearing by October to re-emerge in the pre-dawn sky. — Jamie Carter Look again to the west-northwest soon after dark for the best night of the month to see the crescent moon. Now almost 9%-illuminated and arguably at its most spectacular, it will also be much easier to find than yesterday, simply because it will be higher up in a darker sky for longer. Look for the reflected light of Earth on its dark side — Earthshine — and to its lower right for tiny Mercury, which will become harder to see over the next few nights as it sinks into the sun's glare. Tonight also sees the peak of the annual Bootid meteor shower, a minor affair that will see just a couple of meteors flying about from the constellation Boötes, \"The Herdsman,\" from comet 7P/Pons-Winnecke. — Jamie Carter About 45 minutes after sunset tonight, a beautiful alignment will be visible above the western horizon. The most obvious will be a 16%-illuminated waxing crescent moon, with visible \"Earthshine\" on its darkened limb. Look to its upper left, and you'll see the bright star Regulus and, beyond it, Mars, creating a lovely panorama of three equidistant celestial bodies. It's also a good lesson in scale and the importance of our line of sight because although they all appear aligned, it's just an optical illusion. While the moon is tonight 237,700 miles (382,800 kilometers) distant, Mars is 178 million miles (286 million km), and Regulus is 79 light-years away. If the moon were just an inch away, Mars would be 62 feet away and Regulus about 31,000 miles away. Space is BIG! — Jamie Carter Look above the west tonight immediately after dark at what is perhaps the highlight of the month for anyone interested in exploring the night sky with the naked eye. A beautiful 24%-illuminated crescent moon? Yes — but there's something else. Look just above the curve of the lunar crescent and you'll see Mars, shining at 1.5 magnitude, looking like a cherry on top. With a conjunction this close — just a fifth of a degree apart as seen from North America — it likely won't come as a surprise to learn that from the Pacific Ocean close to northern South America, the moon will briefly occult Mars, according to In The Sky. Such a thing was spectacularly imaged on January 13, 2025, by a new telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona. — Jamie Carter You'll need a low west-northwest horizon for this one, but it's worth making an effort to have a fine view of a slender moon close to Mercury and a couple of famous stars, all strung out in a curved, sickle-shaped formation. About 45 minutes after sunset tonight, a 3.4%-illuminated waxing crescent moon — making its first appearance in the post-sunset sky of its new orbit — will be positioned between two points of light. On its left will be Mercury, at its highest in the night sky of its current apparition (about 16 degrees as seen from mid-northern latitudes). It will shine at a magnitude of near-zero. To the right of the moon will be Pollux, then Castor, the two brightest stars in the constellation Gemini, 37 and 51 light-years from the sun, respectively. The four celestial bodies form an equidistant crescent, with about 2.5 degrees between each one, that will quickly sink into the horizon. — Jamie Carter At 5:33 a.m. EDT, the moon will be roughly between Earth and the sun as it reaches its new phase. That leaves the skies moonlight-free and, consequently, as dark as they get. However, in June in the Northern Hemisphere, it all depends on your latitude (if you're above 48.5 degrees north, then astronomical darkness — when the sun is 18 degrees below the horizon — doesn't occur for a few weeks on either side of the solstice). If it does get properly dark where you are, it's a good night to use binoculars or a small telescope to find objects beginning with 'M' in the night sky, such as the Great Hercules Cluster in the constellation Hercules (M13), the Ring Nebula in Lyra (M57) and the Lagoon Nebula in Sagittarius (M8). The 'M' comes from Charles Messier, a French comet-hunter who categorized 110 Messier objects— fuzzy objects in the night sky that could be confused with comets. He was born on June 26, 1730, exactly 295 years ago tomorrow. — Jamie Carter If you can access dark skies, late June is a great time to begin looking for the Milky Way. Although its arc of stars is always somewhat visible, from the Northern Hemisphere, we spend most of winter and spring looking only at its outer spiral arms. Come late June, the Milky Way's core begins to appear — and with the moon down, this week is perfect for finding it. You will, however, need to stay up late, with the couple of hours after midnight a good time to see it. Look due south; the band of stars will appear to stream down to the horizon through the Summer Triangle asterism — specifically from Deneb to Altair. — Jamie Carter Today is the solstice, the day the sun will not set at the North Pole and will not rise at the South Pole. Caused by Earth's axis being tilted about 23.5 degrees relative to its orbital plane around the sun — thus altering the amount of sunlight different parts of the globe receive at different times of the year (seasons!) — it marks the beginning of astronomical summer north of the equator (which is titled towards the sun) and winter in the Southern Hemisphere (which is tilted away from it). At 10:40 p.m. EDT, the midday sun somewhere on Earth will appear above the Tropic of Cancer, a line of latitude at 23.5 degrees north of the equator. Solstice is when the days begin to get shorter and nights longer in the Northern Hemisphere. That's good news for stargazers, who can tonight celebrate the arrival of warm nights by looking for the famous Summer Triangle asterism. Look east-northeast for the stars Vega (top), Deneb (lower-left) and Altair (lower-right) — a sign not only of summer but of the location of the arc of the Milky Way. — Jamie Carter This one's likely a bit of a challenge — as always with Mercury — but if you fancy seeing the \"Swift Planet,\" then look west-northwest 45 minutes after sunset. You're looking for a slightly reddish point of light with two stars just above — Pollux and Castor in the constellation Gemini, The Twins.\" Early risers should know that from today through August 5, Venus will rise before 3 a.m. local daylight time. Catch it this morning about an hour before sunrise for a view of it beneath a 22%-illuminated waning crescent moon. — Jamie Carter Although there's a good distance between all three, looking east an hour before sunrise will get you a beautiful panorama of a 13%-illuminated waning crescent moon between a bright Venus on the right and the Pleiades open star cluster to the lower left. As well as the lovely sight of Earthshine on the moon's darkened limb, the tableau offers a good lesson in the brightness of objects in the night sky. The moon, the brightest object in the night sky, will shine at -8 magnitude, with Venus about half as bright at -4.2 magnitude, but the scale is logarithmic, with every 1 magnitude difference meaning about 2.5 times difference in brightness — so the moon will be about 33 times brighter than Venus this morning. Both will shine in the faint constellation Aries. — Jamie Carter Here comes one of the stargazing — and astrophotography — highlights of the month. However, it's not particularly convenient. Rising about 3:30 a.m. local time on the east-northeast horizon will be a slender 6%-illuminated waning crescent moon. That alone will look fabulous, but cast your eyes just above to its right and there, not half a degree away, will be the beautiful open cluster of stars called the Pleiades (also called the Seven Sisters and M45). As a bonus, Venus will be blazing away at 4.1 magnitude just to the right of the pair. — Jamie Carter Look to the eastern horizon in the predawn hours on June 20 to spot the waning crescent moon hanging in the constellation Pisces, with Saturn and Neptune to its right and the bright morning star Venus close to the horizon. This is a perfect opportunity to observe the dark basaltic plains of Mare Imbrium (Latin for the Sea of Rains) and Oceanus Procellarum (the Ocean of Storms) scarring the lunar surface. It is thought that Mare Imbrium was created in the wake of a giant impact that created a magma ocean over a thousand kilometers wide, which swiftly cooled in the frigid space environment. — Anthony Wood They may be just past their closest conjunction, but Mars and the bright star Regulus, in the constellation Leo, remain extremely close above the west immediately after dark tonight. The perfect opportunity, then, to gaze at the two and see how the red planet interferes with a popular asterism of springtime. An informal shape of stars beloved of stargazers, rather than an official constellation, the Spring Triangle consists of two stars above Mars and Regulus, Arcturus in the constellation Boötes and Spica in Virgo. If you want to make the Spring Triangle less lopsided, use Denebola — at Leo's rear-end — rather than Regulus. It's a great night to find vast asterisms like this because the moon tonight reaches its last quarter phase, rising around midnight, thus keeping the early evening night skies as dark as possible. However, with the solstice approaching, true darkness in the Northern Hemisphere is now in short supply. — Jamie Carter Although the conjunction between Mars and Regulus was at its best last night, it's virtually identical tonight, so it's worth another look. Visible above the west after dark, the conjunction is worth pondering for the contrast of colors it brings. Look carefully, and you'll see that the light from Mars is reddish (though some see a golden hue), while Regulus is more of an ice-white-blue color. Mars is named after the Roman god of war and Regulus, meaning \"king,\" is known as the \"heart of the Lion\" because it's the brightest star in the constellation Leo. They'll be less than a degree apart tonight, with Mars just above Regulus. — Jamie Carter If you've been following the passage of Mars towards Regulus, the brightest star in the constellation Leo, tonight that journey peaks. Seen above the west after dark for a few hours, the red planet and the blue star will appear to be just seven-tenths of a degree — less than the width of an outstretched little finger — apart. What's more, while Mars will shine at 1.4 magnitude, Regulus will do so at a near-identical 1.35 magnitude. — Jamie Carter Read more: How to see Mars visit a bright star and the moon this June If you're yet to get to know the small but beautiful constellation Corona Borealis, the \"Northern Crown,\" here's a good opportunity. Its lovely crescent of seven stars — found between the Boötes and Hercules constellations — is an entrancing sight in itself, but this season there's an ulterior motive. It's home to a dim star called T Coronae Borealis (also called T CrB and the \"Blaze Star\"), a nova that explodes every 80 years or so — and it's due to go nova during 2025. For its constellation, look about halfway between Arcturus and the bright star Vega high above the southeast. — Jamie Carter Stargazers have a mixed reaction to low-Earth satellites in the night sky. The sight of one streaking overhead can elicit delight in many beginners, particularly since you'll almost certainly see several more after you see one. This week, when darkness is hard to come by in the Northern Hemisphere, is the easiest time to see satellites (particularly just after sunset) simply because the sun doesn't get all that low beneath the horizon, so it's able to shine on satellites high above well after sunset. Heavens-Above is the place to find timings for satellites, notably SpaceX Starlink satellites, which are launched frequently and can sometimes be seen in swarms soon after. Just bear in mind that astronomers and astrophotographers tend to detest the Starlink constellation, which now numbers about 7,000 and routinely ruins scientific data and images of the night sky. Tonight's a good time to look for satellites because the 85%-illuminated waning gibbous moon won't rise until about two hours after sunset.— Jamie Carter We're well into the Noctilucent Clouds season, also called NLCs, which tend to appear in northern skies in June and July. They're not predictable, but they can bring a welcome dose of awe to stargazers in northern latitudes starved of true darkness at this time of year. Appearing as ghostly, wispy webs high up in Earth's atmosphere, they comprise frozen dust. Their position about 47-53 miles (76-85 kilometers) is why they shine at night, able to reflect light from the sun, which for Earthlings below is already beneath the horizon. The Kármán line — the official beginning of space — is defined as 62 miles (100 km) above sea level, which is why NLCs are sometimes called \"space clouds.\" Many mistakenly think the North Star is the brightest in the night sky. If you stood facing east last night to see the Strawberry Moon appear in a blaze of orange light, turn 90 degrees to the right after dark tonight and gaze generally north. Find the seven bright stars of the Big Dipper/The Plough, which look like a kitchen ladle or a deep spoon. It will be in the northwestern night sky with its bowl closer to the horizon. Find the two stars at the end of its bowl, Merak and Dubhe. Mentally extend the distance between the two stars four times, and you'll cross a fairly empty part of the night sky before coming across a bright-ish star. That's Polaris, the North Star. It never appears to move because Earth's northern axis is pointed virtually straight at it. The moon reaches its full phase at 3:44 a.m. EDT (0744 GMT) today. If you want the most impactful view of the full moon this month, watch the moonset early this morning, which will occur shortly before sunrise. Many hours later, the full moon will rise in an already darkened sky for those in North America. A full moon rising is at its best when it rises about 20 minutes after sunset, when the landscape is still visible and the sky is still partly lit. The celestial mechanics don't work out that well today, with sunset and moonrise separated by almost an hour. Still, any moonrise is worth watching. This one will see the Strawberry Moon about 99%-illuminated, slightly on the wane. Although tomorrow is the official date of the full moon, tonight is when to watch it emerge from beneath the southeastern horizon. That's not only because it will be 99.7%-illuminated and so very close to full, but because the celestial mechanics work out better for a good view. Named after the ripening of strawberries in the Northern Hemisphere (yes, moon names are extremely hemispheric!) — though also known as the Rose Moon, Honey Moon and Flower Moon — the time to see this full moon will be moonrise where you are. Today, sunset and moonrise almost coincide, meaning the near-full moon will rise in a fairly bright sky. It will do so in the southeast — almost as far south as the moon can rise — because of what astronomers called its once-every-19-years lunar standstill. — Jamie Carter The largest object in the night sky and one of the largest stars visible to the naked eye come head to head tonight after dark. Look to the southeast about 45 minutes after sunset and you'll see a now 98%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon, by now looking almost full, close to the red supergiant star, Antares. The brightest star in the summer constellation of Scorpius, \"The Scorpion,\" Antares will be to the lower left of the bright moon. The moon will appear just outside Scorpius's claws and later sink into the southwestern horizon, positioned just below Antares, in the gathering light of dawn. — Jamie Carter Today sees the first of three opportunities to see a conjunction between the two planets in the night sky that bear the least resemblance to each other — Jupiter and Mercury. Size-wise, it's not a fair fight — you could fit about 24,000 rocky Mercurys into gas giant Jupiter — and when it comes to brightness in the night sky, the \"Swift Planet\" usually comes off second best, too. However, today in the north-northwest, 45 minutes after sunset, the two will shine at a comparable magnitude. You'll need to find yourself a good, clear view low to the horizon, and be quick about it because the window to see these two worlds together is tight. It would also be wise to have binoculars with you (but don't use them until the sun has set). Here's a second chance to see the conjunction between Jupiter and Mercury, which will shine alongside each other for a short time in the north-northwest 45 minutes after sunset. A low view of the horizon will be necessary to see the two planets just a couple of degrees apart. If you saw a similar sight yesterday, you'll see that Mercury has risen slightly since then. That trend will continue over the next few days, with Jupiter headed the other way. The giant planet will soon drift into the sun's glare, passing behind the sun on June 24, only to re-emerge soon after in the pre-dawn morning sky. If you want to see something super-bright streak across the night sky with your naked eye, forget \"shooting stars\" and visit NASA's Spot The Station website. There, you'll find specific timings for your location for a pass overhead of the International Space Station, which can be searingly bright at this time of year from the Northern Hemisphere. That's because just after sunset, while it's dark all around you, the sun doesn't get that far beneath the horizon, so low-Earth satellites glint in the sunlight. A bright pass of the ISS at this time of year can really impress. — Jamie Carter The 77%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon will tonight shine to the right of bright star Spica, the brightest in the constellation Virgo. Look to the south after dark. Spica will be occulted by the moon early on June 6 as seen from a swathe of mostly uninhabited land in Antarctica, and the Indian Ocean — but also from the tip of southern Tasmania in Australia — according to In The Sky. — Jamie Carter The moon is an endlessly fascinating sight, but for stargazers, it begins to seriously bleach the night sky when it reaches beyond the first quarter phase. So, instead of trying to find faint constellations tonight, which will be a struggle, look again at the terminator on the moon. Thanks to the shadows it throws, this dividing line between lunar day and night tonight reveals two distinct geological features on the moon. Look at the lunar north and you'll see a semicircle of dark grey. This is the Imbrium Basin (Mare Imbrium), the moon's largest impact basin visible to us, slowly being revealed (you'll see more of it tomorrow). Look at the southern end of the terminator and you'll find the moon's Southern Highlands. — Jamie Carter The Red Planet may be well past its best, having reached its once-every-26-months bright opposition in January, but it's worth watching how it moves this month. Tonight, you can see it shining to the right of the bright star Regulus, the brightest in the constellation Leo, \"The Lion,\" which is high in the southwest after dark. Mars will get ever closer to Regulus over the next two weeks, passing closest to it on June 16 and 17. Mars will eventually reach the back of the lion-shaped constellation on June 29, just as a crescent moon slides by. — Jamie Carter Tonight at 10:41 p.m. EDT, the moon reaches its first quarter phase, when it will appear half-lit as seen from Earth. It's merely a line-of-sight phenomenon since half of the moon is always being lit by the sun — the only exception is during a total lunar eclipse, when it travels through Earth's shadow in space (the next one of those occurs on September 7-8, 2025). Tonight is a great time to look at Mare Serenitatis — the Sea of Serenity — a dark area close to the terminator (the division between day and night). — Jamie Carter Although there will be a lovely 20%-illuminated waxing crescent moon in the west immediately after sunset, tonight is a good time to turn your attention to low in the east and northeast sky, where the Summer Triangle is rising. This three-pronged shape comprises the bright stars Vega, Deneb and Altair, but each belongs to its own constellation — Lyra, Cygnus and Aquila, respectively. The later you look, the higher these three constellations will appear in a darker sky — particularly after the moon has set about two hours after sunset. — Jamie Carter No, it's not convenient, but if you're of a mind to check in on Venus as it becomes more distant from Earth on its shorter journey around the sun, this is the morning to do that. Earth's sister planet reaches its greatest elongation west before sunrise this morning, when it will be 46 degrees in angular distance from the sun. Look east anytime before sunrise. Look up 45 minutes after sunset, and you'll see a lovely conjunction with a 29%-illuminated waxing crescent moon close to Mars, with Regulus in Leo beyond. — Jamie Carter As it approaches its half-lit first quarter phase, the moon — tonight 39%-illuminated — will be between the red planet Mars and a famous blue star, Regulus, in the constellation Leo. From North America, the moon will be closest to Regulus — less than two degrees — high in the southwestern sky. They'll be best seen an hour or two after sunset. — Jamie Carter Tonight's moon will look something like a smiley face. Now 12%-illuminated, the waxing crescent moon will put on a slightly lopsided smile, with two bright stars directly above as the eyes — Castor and Pollux in the constellation Gemini. The smiley face will be on show in the west about 45 minutes after sunset and set relatively soon after, so be quick. — Jamie Carter Tonight, the moon will be a slightly larger, brighter crescent. It will be higher in the sky, having moved slightly farther along its orbital path around Earth. Now 5%-illuminated, it will shine directly above Jupiter as seen from North America, above the west-northwest horizon. You'll easily see the dark limb of the moon illuminated by reflected light from Earth's oceans, clouds and ice caps, which is named variously as \"Earthshine,\" \"planet-shine\" and \"Da Vinci glow.\" — Jamie Carter If you're quick tonight and get outside 45 minutes after sunset, you may spot a razor-thin crescent moon in the northwest. Just over 1%-illuminated, you'll likely have to use binoculars, though there is a handy marker nearby — bright planet Jupiter. Find the giant planet close to the horizon and look to its lower right. A good, clear view low to the north-western horizon will be crucial. Since it's so tiny, astronomers often call this first sighting of the crescent the 'old moon in the new moon's arms.' — Jamie Carter If you want to catch a very slim-waning crescent moon — just 11%-illuminated — this is the morning to see it. Best seen about 45 minutes before sunrise where you are, the moon will be to the left of Venus, and very close to the horizon, above due east. — Jamie Carter Another early rise? Yes — but the prize this morning is a great view of the bright center of our galaxy. Best seen about an hour before sunrise at this time of year from the Northern Hemisphere, it will be streaming down the sky, and brightest in the south. As we get closer to summer, it will become visible after midnight, and eventually after sunset in early fall. Although it's a passion of many stargazers, astronomers, and astrophotographers north of the equator to see the Milky Way each summer, the best views are always from the Southern Hemisphere. That's because the galactic central point — where the stars are densest, and the light is brightest — is located in the direction of the Southern Hemisphere. From the Northern Hemisphere, we see the ends of the spiral arms. — Jamie Carter A new moon isn't something to see per se — it's roughly between the Earth and the sun, so invisible to us — but those in coastal areas are bound to feel the effect on tides of what is technically a \"supermoon.\" Turning new at 10:02 EDT today, it's the third-closest new moon to Earth of 2025 at 223,720 miles (360,044 kilometers). With the moon out of the night sky, it's ideal for stargazing if the skies are clear — or take a star trail image, as shown above. Here's how to photograph a star trail. — Jamie Carter Here's another reason to get up about 45 minutes before sunrise. This morning, a 20%-illuminated waning crescent moon will be about four degrees from Venus, with Saturn above-right. Again, you'll need a view low to the eastern horizon and a clear sky. Look out for \"Earthshine\" on the moon's dark side. In late 2023 through mid-2024, Andreas Mogensen — the first Danish astronaut — studied Earthshine, measuring how much light reflected from the moon comes from the sun and how much is reflected from Earth. — Jamie Carter Waking up 45 minutes before sunrise is never easy, but that's the cost if you want to see some beautiful celestial panoramas this morning and through the weekend. You'll need a view low to the eastern horizon — a third-floor (or higher) window works well — as well as a clear sky. This morning, a 30%-illuminated waning crescent moon will be less than three degrees from Saturn, with Venus to the lower left, closer to the horizon. — Jamie Carter Last night's last quarter moon signals the beginning of a 10-night period when there is no bright moonlight in the pre-midnight hours. That makes them ideal for stargazing and astronomy. It's time to go learn some constellations! Start with something you know — like the Big Dipper — then come back here tomorrow to learn something new. As a reminder, the Big Dipper is an asterism — a shape of seven stars — that forms part of a bigger constellation called Ursa Major, the 'Great Bear.' — Jamie Carter You'll see thousands of images of the full moon and the half-lit first-quarter moon, but what about the \"other\" side? Images of the last quarter moon are rarer because it rises at midnight and sets at noon, as opposed to the first quarter moon, which rises at midday — and is already 'up' during twilight — and sets at midnight. Look for features on the westward face of the moon along the terminator (the line between light and shadow) including the Mare Imbrium (Sea of Rains) at the top, the large Ptolemaic crater in the center and the Montes Apenninus mountain range, the latter looking like a line of 'bubbles' at the bottom. — Jamie Carter With the waning gibbous moon rising just before midnight, you'll have most of the evening to find the summer constellation Scorpius, which the moon visited last week. Wait for Antares to appear in the southeast about two hours after sunset, then look above the red supergiant star for three bluish stars that trace the claws of the scorpion — Jaabbah (top), Acrab and Dschubba. These three stars are also known as the \"Crown of the Scorpion.\" — Jamie Carter It's faint and requires dark skies and patience to find, but Ursa Minor, \"The Little Bear\" — also known as the Little Dipper — contains one of the most famous stars in the Northern Hemisphere's night sky. Ursa Minor is a circumpolar constellation, appearing to go round and round all night. There's a reason for that. At the tip of its handle is Polaris, the North Star, which Earth's northern axis points at. At the end of its bowl are Kochab and Pherkad, two stars known as the \"Guardians of the Pole.\" The precession of Earth means that Kochab used to be close to the North Celestial Pole around 1800-1200 BCE, and will be again around 24,000 CE. — Jamie Carter Here comes perhaps the ultimate celestial signpost for stargazers each summer in the Northern Hemisphere. Look to the east a couple of hours after sunset, and you'll see, rising on its side, the glorious sight of the Summer Triangle stars. Why glorious? The Milky Way flows through this asterism (informal shape of stars) tonight as a horizontal band streaming from Deneb on the left to Altair on the right. Above is Vega. This asterism is also a study of how the brightness of stars isn't always indicative of how close they are. For example, Altair and Vega are 17 and 27 light-years distant, respectively, while Deneb is a mighty 1,500 light-years away. It's the farthest bright star. A blue-white supergiant about 200 times larger than the sun, Deneb is one of the biggest stars we know of. — Jamie Carter Go outside a couple of hours after dark, armed with some patience, and you'll have a chance to see one of the most famous constellations. However, the Hercules constellation is fainter than you might think. The core of the spider-like figure is a lopsided square of four stars known as the keystone. You'll find it by first locating bright star Vega above the east (the highest star in the Summer Triangle) and Arcturus high in the south, which you can do by going \"arc to Arcturus\" using the curve of stars in the handle of the Big Dipper. The keystone stars are about a third of the way along that line, closest to Vega. Within the square is M13, the \"Great Globular Cluster\" in Hercules — over 100,000 ancient stars orbiting in the Milky Way's halo. — Jamie Carter With the waning gibbous moon now 89%-illuminated and rising about three hours after sunset, it's a good time to find a seasonal shape of stars now prominent in the southwest right after dark. The three constituent stars are Arcturus, Spica and Regulus in the constellations Boötes, Virgo and Leo, respectively. Arcturus will be on the left, with Spica below, and Regulus off to the right. Just beyond Regulus will be Mars. — Jamie Carter Tonight, a 94% waning gibbous moon will rise in the east a couple of hours after sunset, which is a great time to get outside and watch a moonrise. Once it's up, you'll see that the top-right of the moon, as we look at it from the Northern Hemisphere, is in darkness, with the terminator — which separates day and night on the moon — slicing through some interesting terrain. The shadows will make it relatively easy to see Mare Crisium, the \"sea of crises,\" as well as some obvious craters along the top of the moon. Binoculars will give you a tremendous view. Related: Moon viewing guide: What to look for on the lunar surface Tonight, the moon meets the \"rival of Mars.\" The now 94%-illuminated waning gibbous moon will rise a couple of hours after sunset, again appearing in the south just a third of a degree (less than the width of your little finger held at arm's length) from red supergiant star Antares in the constellation Scorpius, \"the Scorpion.\" Look for Antares to the left of the moon. Its name translates to \"rival of Ares\" (Ares means Mars), not only because of its reddish color but also because it sits close to the ecliptic, so the red planet passes close to it every few years. About 550 light-years from the solar system, Antares has another nickname — the \"Scorpion's Heart.\" — Jamie Carter At 11:56 a.m. EDT today, 100% of the moon will be illuminated by the sun — a full moon. The best time to watch May's \"Flower Moon\" will be moonrise where you are (which is specific to your location), where you can watch it come up from beneath the southeastern horizon. Thanks to Raleigh scattering, there's a short period of about 15 minutes where a full moon is a muted orange, then pale yellow. It's a great time to look at the moon with your naked eyes or a pair of binoculars. Once it's risen high into the sky, it will quickly become too bright to look at comfortably. — Jamie Carter A full moon is coming, but before it arrives, our natural satellite will pass closely to another key bright star of the spring night sky in the Northern Hemisphere. About 94%-illuminated, the waxing gibbous moon will sit about half a degree (less than the width of your little finger held at arm's length) from Spica, which may appear as one point of light but is actually the combined light of two blue giant stars in a binary star system. It's about 250 light-years from the solar system. The moon will be easy to see in the southeast even before sunset, with Spica appearing on its lower left during twilight. — Jamie Carter It may be 400,000 times less bright than the sun, but it's often very easy to see the moon during the day. At first quarter, it rises at noon and sets at midnight, while at full moon a week later it rises at sunset and sets at sunrise. In between, it's big, bright, and high in the southeast all afternoon. Today, it will become very obvious in the east about an hour before sunset in the west, and dominate the dusk. — Jamie Carter Expert moon watchers will tell you not to look at the moon only when it's full or near-full, as it is tonight at 99.5% illuminated. That's true — studying features along the terminator, the dividing line between light and shadow, is the way to go — but looking at the entire Earth-facing side does give you a sense of lunar geography. The most prominent feature is its many maria — seas of ancient lava. Lava flows formed these darker areas on the lunar surface during its formation. It's also worth considering that the moon looks \"upside down\" when viewed from the Southern Hemisphere, where the moon — which roughly follows the sun's path through the sky — appears in the northern sky. — Jamie Carter If you're going to be a stargazer and navigate the night sky, you need to know about Arcturus. A red giant star 37 light-years from the solar system is easy to find — and not just because it's the fourth-brightest star in the night sky. Just follow the stars of the Big Dipper's handle to go in an \"arc to Arcturus\" in the east, towards — but not as far as — the 89%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon in the southeast. The constellation that Arcturus is part of, Boötes \"The Herdsman,\" is to the left of the star. Given that the Big Dipper is part of the constellation Ursa Major, \"The Great Bear,\" it's perhaps not surprising that Arcturus means \"Guardian of the Bear.\" — Jamie Carter It’s one of the official 88 constellations, and it’s easy to see in the night sky, so why is the kite-shaped constellation Corvus “The Crow” so little known? In the southern sky immediately after dark and below the 82%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon, its five main constituent stars — Gienah, Kraz, Algorab, Minkar and Alchiba — should be relatively easy to find just to the right of bright star Spica. If not, come back in a week when the moon will be out of the sky. — Jamie Carter Today, it’s exactly two years since King Charles III was coronated. So why not find a star (kinda) named after him, Cor Caroli? Meaning “Charles’s Heart,” Cor Caroli is actually named after King Charles I or II — nobody is quite sure which one. Anytime after dark, look north for the Big Dipper. Find the star at the end of its handle, Alkaid, then go directly above about the same length as the handle. Part of the two-star constellation Canes Venatici, Cor Caroli is a binary star system about 110 light-years from the solar system. Tonight, it’s around a third of the way between Alkaid and the 74%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon in the east. — Jamie Carter Once the moon has reached about a third-lit, it begins to become bright and less interesting to see with the naked eye. However, it's worth looking for tonight because it will form a nice triangle with a planet and a star. Now 34%-illuminated and visible from sunset until midnight, it will hang below Mars and to the upper-right of Procyon, the eighth-brightest star in the night sky and the brightest (and only notable) star in the constellation Canis Minor. — Jamie Carter At 45%-illuminated, the moon is tonight perilously close to reaching its First Quarter phase, where its brightness begins to bleach the light sky. However, tonight, it should be a target for skywatchers as it is very close to Mars. Its exact position will depend on where you are and when you look, but from many locations, the moon will be perched just above Mars — a stunning sight! If you have a pair of binoculars, it will get even better, because Mars will be beside the stunning Beehive Cluster open cluster of stars. — Jamie Carter Tonight, the moon reaches its first quarter phase, which makes all but the brightest stars harder to see. So why not focus on those brightest stars? Look to the west about 45 minutes after sunset, and you'll see bright Jupiter due west. High to its right side will be bright Capella in Auriga, the \"Goat Star,\" while to its lower left will be Betelgeuse in Orion and, closer to the horizon, Sirius in Canis Major. The four will together form a cosmic curve above the western horizon. — Jamie Carter Now 24%-illuminated, the waxing crescent moon will tonight hang roughly halfway between Mars, to its upper left and Jupiter, to its lower right. Look to the western sky from about 45 minutes after sunset. — Jamie Carter Tonight is your second chance in a row to see a waxing crescent moon shining close to bright Jupiter. This time, the moon will be 14%-illuminated and appear just above Jupiter. They'll be roughly equidistant between two bright stars, Betelgeuse in Orion to the lower left and bright Capella in Auriga to the upper right. — Jamie Carter Here's the first of two successive opportunities to see the beautiful crescent moon visit the biggest planet in the solar system. Look to the western sky about 45 minutes after sunset, and you'll see a 7%-illuminated waxing crescent moon approaching Jupiter, shining at mag. 2. The two will form a triangle with red supergiant star Aldebaran below, the brightest star in the constellation Taurus, which Jupiter is currently residing within. — Jamie Carter Look to your east this morning about 45 minutes before sunrise, and you'll see a beautiful planetary view. The most obvious world will be Venus, which will shine at mag. -4.4, though barely two degrees below it will be Saturn shining at mag. 1.2. That makes Venus 174 times brighter than Saturn tonight. If you're lucky, you may also see Mercury much closer to the horizon, due east. For a bonus sight, be outside shortly after sunset, and you will stand a slim chance of seeing a very slender crescent moon just above the western horizon. Since it will be 2%-illuminated, this is going to be a challenging observation, but it is possible to see such a slim moon. Although you may be able to see it with the naked eye, a pair of binoculars will help hugely, particularly because the beautiful Pleiades open cluster of stars will be positioned just above the crescent moon. — Jamie Carter If you've only got the time, energy or inclination to get up before sunrise just once this month to do astronomy, make it this morning. About 45 minutes before sunrise in the east an 8% illuminated waning crescent moon will form a tight equilateral triangle with Venus and Saturn, with no more than a couple of degrees between all three solar system bodies. It's undoubtedly the observing and astrophotography highlight of the week and, arguably, the month. Look carefully; you may see Mercury below the crescent moon, shining at mag. 0.4. — Jamie Carter Here's an interesting bright star to bright planet hop that won't be possible in the evening sky for much longer. Be outside shortly after sunset, looking west, and you should easily be able to pick out the planet Jupiter, shining at mag. -1.9 in the constellation Taurus. To its lower left will be Betelgeuse, a mag. -0.5 reddish star directly above the unmistakable three stars of Orion's Belt. Go the same distance again toward the southwest, and you'll come to Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky at mag. -1. Its name means \"lit\" in Latin, but it's referred to as the \"Dog Star\" since it's the brightest in the constellation Canis Major, the \"big dog.\" — Jamie Carter If you were wowed by Venus in the post-sunset night sky for much of the first half of 2025, prepare to be dazzled once again — but only if you get up very early. Looking east 45 minutes before sunrise will allow you to see Venus shining at a brilliant mag. -4.5, the brightest it will get its new apparition as the \"Morning Star.\" If you have a small telescope, train it on Venus, and you'll be treated to the intriguing view of the cloudy planet as a 26%-illuminated crescent, a consequence of its position between Earth and the sun and its current closeness to Earth. Today, we also have a new moon — when our natural satellite is roughly between Earth and the sun. A new moon is completely invisible to us unless there is a solar eclipse, as there was last month. However, there is something special about this new moon, which happens to be the closest of the year, effectively making it a \"supermoon,\" though that colloquial name is usually more commonly used to refer only to the closest full moons of the year. — Jamie Carter Here's another chance to see a fine conjunction of Venus and an even slimmer crescent moon. Look at the east about 45 minutes before sunrise and you'll see a 16%-illuminated waning crescent moon approaching Venus, shining at -4.4 mag. above Saturn at mag. 1.2. The three solar system bodies will form an elongated triangle on its side. — Jamie Carter Celestial mechanics this month means that beautiful planetary views require some dedication. While for much of the year the planets have been post-sunset events, Venus and Saturn have now moved to the pre-dawn morning sky. This morning, about 45 minutes before sunrise, look to the east-southeast, and you'll see a 26% illuminated waning crescent moon to the right side of Venus, which will be shining at mag. -4.4 above the far dimmer Saturn, at mag. 1.2 — Jamie Carter Long after the sun has risen, then sunk, get outside to see the peak of the Lyrids, a medium-strength meteor shower caused by dust and debris left in the inner solar system by comet Thatcher (C/1861). According to the American Meteor Society, expect about 18 \"shooting stars\" per hour at the peak, which will occur in daylight — so get outside as soon as it gets dark. A bright waning crescent moon, now 40%-illuminated, won't rise until well after midnight. — Jamie Carter Although the peak of the annual Lyrid meteor shower isn't until tomorrow night, according to the American Meteor Society, this medium-strength shower typically produces good rates of \"shooting stars\" for three nights centered on the maximum. So tonight is a good night for a stargazing session, clear skies allowing, as is Tuesday, April 22 and Wednesday, April 23. — Jamie Carter Read more: The Lyrids are back: How to catch this year's spring meteor shower If you're stargazing into the wee hours tonight, in the northeast you'll see some familiar summer stars rise — Vega, Deneb and Altair, which make up the popular Summer Triangle asterism. Deneb, beneath Vega, is in the constellation Cygnus, which depicts a figure resembling a flying swan. However, turn it on its head, it's known as something else entirely — the Northern Cross. Deneb acts at the top of the cross, which appears on its side tonight. — Jamie Carter If you missed Mercury as an easy post-sunset target in early March, here's another chance to catch the \"Swift Planet.\" Although it will shine at only mag. 0.3, it should be possible to see Mercury in twilight by looking east about 45 minutes before sunrise. Today, it reaches its highest altitude in the morning sky, so it is farthest from the sun as seen from Earth. — Jamie Carter If you need any more proof that the meteor shower season has arrived, tonight, Earth will bust through a cloud of dust and debris left in the inner solar system by none other than Halley's Comet. Although the peak night, when an impressive 50 \"shooting stars\" per hour can be expected, won't occur until Saturday, May 3 through Sunday, May 4, the Eta Aquariids meteor shower begins tonight. Primarily a Southern Hemisphere shower, expect to see a few swift meteors emanating from the constellation Aquarius, which rises in the east just before dawn in the Northern Hemisphere. — Jamie Carter The Lyrid meteor shower season has begun. Although the night skies are always buzzing with sporadic shooting stars, the Lyrid meteor shower is the first dense concentration of them since January's Quadrantids. Although it won't peak until Tuesday, April 22, through Wednesday, April 23, the Lyrid meteor shower is active from April 16 through April 26. Expect a handful of \"shooting stars\" per hour, with a good chance of bright fireballs. — Jamie Carter What latitude do you live at? You can easily tell by using Polaris. Go outside after dark and look north, locating Polaris. Now, measure how high Polaris is above the horizon using your fists on outstretched arms held up to the sky. Three fists? You're 30 degrees north of the equator. Four fists? 40 degrees. You get the idea. Three outstretched fingers span about five degrees, and an outstretched little finger spans a single degree. This basic system works because humans are all built to scale. That means anyone can measure apparent distance in the night sky using their fists and fingers. — Jamie Carter Here are some stars visible year-round, which is why they're known to almost everyone. Riding particularly high this month are the seven bright stars of the Big Dipper/Plough, circumpolar stars that appear to revolve around Polaris, the North Star, every 24 hours. You can use the two stars on the left of the bowl of the Big Dipper/Plough to easily find Polaris. Trace a line from Dubhe through Alkaid and keep going down to the horizon until you come to the only bright star you can see in the region of the sky. That's Polaris — that's due north. — Jamie Carter Look due east for perhaps the definitive constellation of spring in the Northern Hemisphere. Boötes — which means \"the herdsman\" — is centered on a bright star called Arcturus, a red supergiant star only about 37 light-years distant. It's above the east shortly after dark. Look to its left and make a rough \"Y\" shape. The constellation has other faint stars, but the \"Y\" — which also looks like a champagne glass — is the easiest way to see and remember it. — Jamie Carter With the moon now behind it — literally — it's a good time to find and familiarise yourself with the constellation Leo. The most obvious shape to look for is the \"sickle\" of Leo, resembling a backward question mark that uses the constellation's brightest star, Regulus, as the period. Denebola marks the tip of the lion's tail. — Jamie Carter A full moon is best viewed when it rises in the east about 20-30 minutes after the sun has set in the west. That way, its delicate, orangey light can be seen appearing above a landscape that still has some residual twilight illuminating it. However, it doesn't always work out that way. Tonight, for North America, the full moon rises almost exactly at sunset, meaning it will look rather pale and lack the drama of appearing in a twilight sky. As recompense, it will appear very close to one of the most famous stars in the night sky, Spica in Virgo. Watch it at 8:23 p.m. EDT and you'll catch the exact moment of the full moon. From most of South America, the full moon will occult (cover up) Spica for a short time, according to In-The-Sky.org. — Jamie Carter There isn't a good night to see the full moon rise this month for Europe, but tonight is the next best thing. Although it will no longer be close to Spica, the just-past-full moon will appear in the east about an hour after sunset. Incidentally, the 'Pink Moon' is also called the 'Pascal Moon' this month because it helps determine the date of Easter Sunday. According to the Western Christian church, Easter falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon on or after the spring equinox. — Jamie Carter Mars has been in the constellation of Gemini for many months, appearing to move one way, then the other, thanks to our point of view of the red planet from Earth. It will appear to form a straight line tonight with \"the twins\" of Gemini, Castor and Pollux, after dark. Although it's an optical alignment that has been apparent for at least a few nights and will continue for a few more, it's tonight when it's at its most perfect. — Jamie Carter Here's a nice asterism (the shape of stars, not an official constellation) that can only be seen in spring and summer. The Diamond of Virgo is formed by Arcturus in the constellation Boötes, Spica in Virgo, Denebola in Leo and Cor Caroli in Canes Venatici. This region of the sky includes a wealth of galaxies. — Jamie Carter Where you look in the night sky is instructive. Tonight, look towards the western horizon after dark and see the constellation of Orion and the other winter stars sinking into the haze. The stars you see are part of the Orion Arm, a spiral arm of our Milky Way galaxy. Now look to the south for Leo, which covers the \"realm of the galaxies.\" You've just turned your gaze from looking into our galaxy to looking away from it and into deep space. Stargazing is geography on the grandest scale. — Jamie Carter Tonight, a 79%-illuminated waning crescent moon will shine in the constellation Leo, a famous spring shape of stars now clearly visible after dark. The moon will be close to Regulus, one of the brightest stars in the night sky and about 77 light-years from the solar system. Its nicknames include \"Heart of the Lion\" and \"Little King.\" Look high in the southeast anytime after dark. — Jamie Carter Tonight, the moon reaches its first quarter phase, which is seen as half-lit from our point of view. It’s now rising around midday, setting around midnight, and beginning to bleach the night sky, making faint objects harder to see. Its position tonight at the feet of the constellation Gemini — about two-thirds of the way between Jupiter and Mars (closest to it) — makes it ideal for use as an aid to finding the bright stars Capella (to the right of the moon) and Betelgeuse (below the moon). — Jamie Carter Tonight, there's the pretty sight of a reasonably bright Mars (mag. 0.5) — noticeably still emitting a rosy, reddish or golden light — shining next to a now 60%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon. The two solar system objects will be about two degrees from each other. Look directly above the pair, and you'll see bright stars. That's Pollux (closest to the moon and Mars) and Castor (farthest), the so-called \"twins\" of the constellation Gemini. Pollux, 34 light-years distant, will look distinctly yellowish and will form a triangle with the moon and Mars tonight. Add Castor, which is 51 light-years distant and makes an upside-down Y-shape. The moon may be getting bright in the post-sunset night sky, but there's something you should look at before it’s gone for six months. Containing — and close to — some of the very brightest stars and most impressive stars in the night sky, Orion is perhaps the most famous constellation of all. Tonight in the west, the iconic Orion's Belt will appear horizontal, with Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka — the \"Three Kings\" — prominent. Below them will be bright blue Rigel, with ruddy Betelgeuse above. Follow Orion's Belt to the south, and you'll come to Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. — Jamie Carter Tonight is another chance for a mini “planet parade,” with a now 38%-illuminated waxing crescent moon shining roughly equidistant between Jupiter and Mars. The red planet, shining at mag. 0.5, will be above the moon, with mag. -2 Jupiter below it. Look southwest anytime after sunset. — Jamie Yesterday, the Pleiades were visited by a delicate waxing crescent moon in one of the most spectacular stargazing sights of the year so far (see photo below). Tonight, it’s the turn of Jupiter, shining at mag -2.1, with the giant planet and a now 27%-illuminated crescent moon to appear together in the constellation Taurus in the post-sunset western sky. They’ll be separated by about five degrees, so this isn’t a super-close conjunction, but it will be a beautiful sight. — Jamie Carter Andy Moran captured this stunning view of the waxing crescent moon shining below the Pleiades on April 1. The moon's darker portion is beautifully illuminated by earthshine, a soft glow created by sunlight reflecting off Earth's surface. Editor's note: If you capture an astronomy photo and would like to share it with Space.com's readers, send your photo(s), comments, and your name and location to spacephotos@space.com. It may be April Fools’ Day, but believe us when we say that tonight’s passage of a slim waxing crescent moon through one of the most beautiful objects in the night sky will have astrophotographers out in full force. High in the west after sunset, a 17%-illuminated waxing crescent moon will be about half a degree above the Pleiades, an open cluster of stars around 440 light-years distant. Close by, Jupiter will be easily visible, shining at mag. -2.1. — Jamie Carter If yesterday’s attempt at seeing the slimmest possible waxing crescent moon failed, try again tonight when it will now be 9%-illuminated and a little easier to see. If you can see Orion's Belt—three horizontal stars sting above the southwest—follow them in a straight line to the right. Look slightly below that imaginary line when you get to due west. — Jamie Carter Here's another final hurrah for a staple of the winter night sky in the Northern Hemisphere — catch it while you can! Look to the south after dark, and you’ll easily spot Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, pointed at by the three stars of Orion's Belt nearby. To the upper-left of Sirius is Procyon in Canis Minor, and to its upper-right is Betelgeuse in Orion. As luck would have it, you can go equidistant beyond Procyon to Mars and from Betelgeuse to Jupiter. — Jamie Carter Here comes a partial solar eclipse for the entire western hemisphere north of the equator. It will be visible at sunrise from eastern North America and in mid-morning across Western Europe, with the former seeing as much as 94% of the sun blocked by the moon and the latter a lot less. Those along the eastern coast of North America, specifically northeastern U.S. states (such as New England and Maine) and eastern and southeastern Canada (Quebec and New Brunswick) are on the sunrise line. It's taking place exactly one lunar year (12 orbits of the moon around Earth) since a total solar eclipse across North America on April 8, 2024. Everyone will need proper eye protection — eclipse glasses and solar filters for all cameras and binoculars — at all times. — Jamie Carter Editor's You can also keep up with the latest solar eclipse news and events with our solar eclipse live blog. Related: — What time is the partial solar eclipse on Monday? — Partial solar eclipse 2025 livestreams: Watch online for free Here’s a challenge for every stargazer who likes to see something almost nobody else ever does. Be outside looking west immediately after sunset, and you’ll have a chance to glimpse a 3%-illuminated waxing crescent moon, just a day past it crossing the sun to cause a solar eclipse. It will be close to the western horizon — almost directly below bright Jupiter—but it will be dim, so you may need a pair of binoculars. British stargazers wanting to remain punctual should also know that in the U.K., the clocks go forward by an hour. — Jamie Carter Here’s a good night to spot two very bright stars in the night sky by indulging in one of the most famous star hops. Start with Arcturus, the brightest star in the constellation Boötes, which is now rising in the east as the sun sets in the west — a sure sign that spring has arrived. Find the curve of stars that make up the handle of the Big Dipper/Plough above the northeast, and travel in an arc until you come to a very bright reddish, bright star. That’s Arcturus, the fourth brightest in the night sky, whose name means “Guardian of the Bear” since it follows Ursa Major (location of the big Dipper/the Plough) across the sky. Now go across the horizon to Spica, a bright blueish star in Virgo, another springtime star in the Northern Hemisphere. — Jamie Carter Look west as the sky darkens, and there, laid out in front of you, will be the last vestiges of the winter night sky. Face west and cast your eyes from the Monoceros constellation in the southwest to the Cassiopeia constellation in the northwest. You’ll see some of the most famous constellations and, as luck would have it, a couple of bright planets laid over a glowing star field — the winter Milky Way. Due west will be Jupiter, with the bright star Aldebaran and the Pleiades star cluster just below it. Above it, to the right, will be Capella in Auriga, and to the left, Mars. To Jupiter’s left will be the bright stars of Orion and, beyond it, Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. Find somewhere without light pollution and savor a final view before these gems soon sink into the western horizon. — Jamie Carter Corona Borealis (Northern Crown) is a slight but beautiful curve of seven stars that’s currently famous as the home of T Coronae Borealis (also called T CrB and the \"Blaze Star\"), a nova that explodes every 80 years or so. T CrB was expected to explode between April and September 2024 and will likely explode during 2025. To find it between the Boötes and Hercules constellations, look for the Big Dipper in the northern sky and follow its handle to go \"“arc to Arcturus,\" a common star-hop for stargazers. Arcturus is in the east. Now find bright Vega, low in the northeast. Corona Borealis is about halfway between the two. — Jamie Carter Read more: Is the 'Blaze Star' about to explode? If it does, here's where to look in March Here's a lovely target to look for, particularly if you have really dark skies. One of the closest and brightest open star clusters visible to the naked eye — but not as easy to see as the Pleiades — the Beehive Cluster (also called M44) is home to hundreds of stars. Greek astronomer Ptolemy described it as the \"Little Cloud,\" which is very much what it looks like. It's in the dim and uninteresting Cancer constellation between Leo and Gemini. — Jamie Carter Editor's note: Sign up for our NEW skywatching newsletter \"Night Sky This Week\" to discover this week's must-see night sky events, moon phases, and stunning astrophotos. Looking east after dark tonight will raise a question. To the south will be the bright star Sirius, but what’s that backward question mark shape to its left? It’s the \"sickle\" of Leo, an asterism that makes up the front of the Leo constellation. The dot is Regulus, the constellation’s brightest star, with the tip of the sickle — also the lion's head — a star called Algenubi. At the other end of the constellation is the star Denebola, which represents the tip of the lion’s tail. Although it’s beyond the reach of the naked eye, between Regulus and Denebola is the M96 or Leo I Group of galaxies, a cluster of nine galaxies. When you look in the direction of Leo, you’re looking away from the bright stars of the Milky Way and out into the universe beyond. Stargazers, get ready! With the moon today reaching its last (or third) quarter phase, it rises half-lit around midnight. Beyond tonight, it rises as a crescent ever later, clearing the night sky of moonlight. However, there is a good reason to stay up until midnight to watch the moon rise because it will do so at its southernmost declination of 2025. Look north after dark and find the familiar constellations of Cassiopeia and the Big Dipper, with Polaris — the North Star — between them. Now look about halfway between Polaris and the lowest star in Cassiopeia's \"W\" or \"M\" for a bright star. This is Errai, a once and future North Star because of the precession of Earth’s axis (a predictable phase cycle that takes place over 22,000 years). It’s also the top of the faint Cepheus constellation, named after a Greek mythological king. It looks more like how a child might draw a house, with Errai as the highest point of a pitched roof. Below it are four stars that roughly form a square. Dark country skies will help with this one. — Jamie Carter At precisely 09:00 UTC (05:00 a.m. EDT) is the vernal equinox (equi is Latin for equal, nox for night), which sees roughly 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night everywhere on Earth. With Earth’s tilted axis side-on to the sun, it also sees the beginning of spring in the Northern Hemisphere and autumn in the Southern Hemisphere. The sun rises due east and sets due west on the equinox, an event that causes shadows to shift either side, marked by ancient monuments including Chichén Itzá, Mexico, where seven triangular shadows move down the steps of the Pyramid of Kukulcán in an event called the “descent of the serpent.” — Jamie Carter Read more: Spring equinox 2025: Say goodbye to winter in the Northern Hemisphere today The sky is full of constellations, many of them esoteric and hard to find, but there are plenty of easy-to-locate asterisms — unofficial shapes of stars — that make it much easier to learn the night sky. Top of the list in March has to be the Spring Triangle, a simple equilateral shape that joins the bright stars Arcturus in the constellation Boötes, Spica in Virgo and Denebola in Leo. You'll find them in the southwest sky. — Jamie Carter You know how to find the Big Dipper/Plough in the northern sky, but what about its parent constellation, Ursa Major? The Big Dipper/Plough is seven stars that make the unmistakable shape of a handle and a cup, but it's merely the tail and hindquarters of Ursa Major — the \"Great Bear.\" Trace out the stars of this vast, famous, yet usually ignored constellation, and you'll be one of very few who can. Late March is the ideal time to do so since Ursa Major is high in the sky, hence the memory aid \"spring up, fall down.\" — Jamie Carter It's one of the most spectacular naked eye sights in the winter night sky, but the Pleiades — also called the Seven Sisters and M45 — will soon sink into the western horizon shortly after sunset. The stars of the Pleiades feature in the lore of many cultures, often symbolizing good fortune, navigation and protection. The ancient Greeks linked its appearance to agricultural prosperity; in Japan (where it’s called Subaru), it's related to guidance and harmony, and in Navajo culture, it's a symbol of unity and order in the universe. It's also a sight that’s better looked at with the naked-eye than through a telescope. Read more: The Pleiades: Facts about the \"Seven Sisters\" star cluster It's only four days since Venus and Mercury were in conjunction, but there’s an extra reason to grab any glimpse of Venus — before it’s gone completely from the post-sunset night sky. Get as low a view of the western horizon as possible, and you may see bright Venus close to a dim Mercury to its left. Both inner planets have phases — just as the moon does, as seen from Earth — because they are inner planets. Venus is barreling towards Earth, getting closest next week as it travels through the sun’s glare and transits to the pre-dawn morning sky. It’s now a mere 4%-lit, a lovely sight in a small telescope or a large pair of binoculars just after the sun has set. Venus remains so bright, despite being only slightly illuminated, because it’s close to Earth — and its disk relatively larger in our sky — but also because it’s covered in a layer of very reflective clouds. — Jamie Carter From today until the end of the month, it is a good time to be somewhere exceptionally dark at sunset. With the near-full moon out of the immediate post-sunset sky—and rising about 50 minutes later each night—the stage is set for a display of zodiacal light. Sunshine reflects dust in the solar system, and zodiacal light is seen as a subtle triangle of light during twilight above the sunset point on the western horizon. You’ll need to be somewhere as far from light pollution as possible. As the bright waxing gibbous moon rises in the east a few hours after sunset, bright star Spica will shine a few degrees underneath it. The 16th brightest star in the night sky, Spica, is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo. Its rising is a sure sign that spring is coming to the Northern Hemisphere. About 250 light-years from the sun, Spica is a double-star system, with two stars that orbit each other every four days. — Jamie Carter With no total lunar eclipse visible since 2022, stargazers will be out in force for this relatively rare and always spectacular event. It’s arguably one of the most enjoyable and relaxing cosmic spectacles of all, with the lunar surface turning a reddish-orange-pinkish color for a leisurely 65 minutes.

Although it's visible in part from the entire night side of Earth, the best views will be from North America, from where totality —a.k.a. the “blood moon” moment—will occur at these times across North America: — 2:26-3:31 a.m. EST on Friday, March 14, 2025 — 1:26-2:31 a.m. CST on Friday, March 14, 2025 — 00:26-1:31 a.m. MST on Friday, March 14, 2025 — 11:26 p.m. on PST Thursday, March 13, 2025, to 00:31 a.m. on Friday, March 14, 2025 — 10:26-11:31 p.m. AKST on Thursday, March 13, 2025 — 8:26-9:31 p.m. HST on Thursday, March 13, 2025 However, it’s worth being outside about 75 minutes before these times to see the partial phase, where Earth’s shadow creeps across the lunar surface. In Europe, the best views will be had just before moonset on Friday, March 14, 2025. You can watch the lunar eclipse online here on Space.com and catch up with the latest lunar eclipse news and events with our lunar eclipse live blog. Read more: Total lunar eclipse March 2025 — When and where to see the next 'Blood Moon' lunar eclipse Can you find the \"North Star?\" Earth's northern axis points at Polaris, hence its name, each night, as seen from the Northern Hemisphere. It appears never to move for any one location — and it's easy to find. Tonight, the Big Dipper is in the northeast, its bowl highest in the sky a couple of hours after dark. Just find the two stars at the outer edge of the Big Dipper's bowl—Dubhe and Merak. Now go in a straight line connecting these two stars, traveling to the left (toward due north) about five times the distance between them and you get to Polaris at the tip of the handle of the smaller, dimmer Little Dipper. The altitude of Polaris above the northern horizon is hugely valuable to navigators because it corresponds to the observer’s latitude on Earth. The farther north you travel from the equator, the higher it becomes until you reach the North Pole, where Polaris will be directly above you. For example, if Polaris is 40 degrees above the horizon, you're at 40 degrees latitude. You can measure the altitude of Polaris by using an outstretched arm against the sky—three fingers are equivalent to five degrees, and a fist is 10 degrees. — Jamie Carter Tonight’s almost full moon, now 95%-illuminated, shines just a couple of degrees from Regulus in the constellation Leo, one of the 20 brightest stars in the night sky at mag. +1.3. Known as the \"Heart of the Lion,\" Regulus means \"little king\" in Latin. It was deemed a \"Royal Star\" by the Babylonians and Persians, along with Aldebaran, Antares and Antares. About 79 light-years from Earth, Regulus is rising in the eastern sky shortly after sunset every night this month — a sure sign that spring is coming in the Northern Hemisphere. — Jamie Carter It’s time to say goodbye to Venus. After many months of it dominating the post-sunset night sky, it’s on the verge of disappearing. However, it goes out with a flourish, paired with its little sister Mercury tonight after sunset. Look due west for the two inner planets, but do it quickly because they’ll only be visible for about 45 minutes from 30 minutes after sunset. You can try for the same sight for the next week or so, but it will get more challenging each night as both planets head into the sun's glare. — Jamie Carter Tonight, you'll see a similar scene to last night, with a waxing gibbous moon — now 64%-lit — roughly between Mars, on its left, and Jupiter, on its right. Just beyond Mars are Pollux and Castor in Gemini, while just below Jupiter is Aldebaran in Taurus. However, there is also something slightly unusual about the moon tonight, which will reach its northernmost position in 2025. — Jamie Carter If you're going to look for Mercury once in 2025, make it tonight. Today, the inner planet Mercury reaches its easternmost elongation, about 18 degrees from the sun, which puts it at its highest altitude in the post-sunset sky. It's only going to shine at -0.3 magnitude, but it will be worth looking for above due west for about an hour after sunset. Venus will shine above it. Once you've spotted it, about-turn to face southeast for the lovely sight of a 74%-lit waxing gibbous moon just a couple of degrees from reddish-golden Mars. — Jamie Carter This morning at 02:00 a.m., local time saw the clocks go ahead (“spring toward, fall back”) for one hour in North America, signaling the beginning of daylight saving time. Fittingly, it’s also a good night to see another seasonal clock in the sky. Look due north after sunset. On the left, you’ll see the W-shape of stars called Cassiopeia, and on the right will be the seven stars of the Big Dipper, the latter part of the Ursa Major constellation. After sunset in March, they are positioned exactly as you see them, but in September, they’re on opposite sides. That’s because both are circumpolar constellations. Since they are on either side of Polaris, the North Star (which you can see shining between them), their positions shift throughout the night due to Earth’s rotation. — Jamie Carter Tonight, it’s the first quarter moon, traditionally the time stargazers stop looking for faint constellations and objects and instead focus on looking for bright stars and planets. That’s because the moon’s visibly half-lit surface begins to reflect a lot of glare around the night sky. Lucky for stargazers, the moon — shining brightly in the south after sunset — is tonight surrounded by spectacularly bright objects, with Jupiter just five degrees from it and Mars slightly farther to the left. Below, you’ll see the bright stars Betelgeuse and Rigel on either side of Orion’s belt, with Sirius — the brightest star in the night sky — below, above due south, with Procyon above. — Jamie Carter The moon will move across or close to the Pleiades open cluster of stars during every orbit of Earth this year. Tonight, Ash Wednesday, isn't one of the best in 2025 since it passes just half a degree from the Pleiades during daylight in North America. By the time the sky is dark, a 42%-illuminated waxing crescent moon will sit a couple of degrees above the Pleiades, about halfway between it and Jupiter in the constellation Taurus. The Pleiades will be positioned midway between the moon and Uranus beneath, though the seventh planet will be near-impossible to see unless you have incredibly dark skies (and excellent eyesight). — Jamie Carter With the vernal equinox coming up in a few weeks, the time is now for a possible “equinoctal effect” on the northern lights. With Earth’s axis perpendicular to the sun and its solar wind — a stream of charged particles — Earth’s magnetic field is slightly weakened. The result is that the solar wind has more of an effect on Earth’s magnetosphere—the region of space where its magnetic field dominates — often causing a noticeable uptick in aurora. According to the Russell-McPherron Effect, cracks also open up in the magnetosphere, letting in more charged particles. In short, if you experience any geomagnetic storm predicted by NOAA this month, it could well be stronger and cause more aurora than is typical. — Jamie Carter Read more: Why March is the best month to see the northern lights Editor's note: Keep up to date with the latest northern lights forecasts and alerts with our aurora live blog. There could be some unsettled conditions over the coming days! Look west immediately after sunset, and you may have a chance of seeing tiny Mercury poking above the horizon. It’s rising, so it will become easier through Saturday, March 8, but tonight is a good time to start looking for it. However, the big drawcard in the post-sunset night sky is still Venus, which tonight shines brightly at mag. -4.4 immediately above Mercury. Don’t take views of Venus for granted because it’s now rapidly sinking into the horizon and will soon be gone from the post-sunset sky. A 20%-illuminated crescent moon will be above the pair, with Jupiter beyond. — Jamie Carter Look west for a slim crescent moon as soon as it is dark. It will be about 6%-illuminated, so it won't be easy to see below Venus. Patience will be required (and perhaps a pair of binoculars). Venus will be shining at a brilliant magnitude of -4.8. — Jamie Carter Here's an easier target than last night — a crescent moon higher in the sky alongside a brilliantly bright planet. As soon as it gets dark, look due west, and you'll quickly see a 12%-illuminated waxing crescent moon above Venus. Look carefully at the dark side of the moon's limb, and you may see some subtle light. That's Earthshine, sunlight reflected by Earth's clouds and remaining ice caps onto the lunar surface. — Jamie Carter Shining brightly at magnitude -2.3, Jupiter still dominates the post-sunset sky in the east. This week passes close to Aldebaran, the brightest star in the constellation Taurus, the bull. This magnitude 0.8 star, an orange supergiant star, is known as the 'eye of the bull,' but its name translates as \"the follower\" in Arabic because it's positioned close to the Pleiades open cluster of stars, which you'll see close to Aldebaran and Jupiter. — Jamie Carter It may be one of the most famous constellations, but Perseus, the hero, is not an easy shape of stars to pick out in the night sky. Go out soon after sunset and find brilliant Venus in the west and bright Jupiter in the east. Perseus can be found roughly halfway between them, above you, but more to the northern side of the night sky as seen from the Northern Hemisphere. A vague V-shape of stars, Perseus features a prominent curve of right stars, with the brightest being Mirfak and Algol, the latter known as a \"winking demon\" because it's two stars orbiting each other, one of which blocks the other regularly. The demon star follows a precise cycle of brightening and dimming, completing one full pattern every 2 days, 20 hours, and 49 minutes. In 2024, astronomers using the new Euclid telescope discovered over 1,500 billion intracluster stars outside the 100,000 galaxies in Perseus, appearing to wander the cosmos. Yesterday, Mars stopped going backward. Since Dec. 6, 2024, it has been appearing to travel westward across the night sky as it brightened, a consequence of its getting very close to Earth. Tonight, that so-called retrograde motion ceases, with the red planet continuing on its apparent prograde path and eastward motion across the stars. It's been moving further into the constellation Gemini, close to bright stars Castor and Pollux. It's there tonight, but starting tonight, it will begin to exit and move back toward the constellation Leo. — Jamie Carter Here's a great excuse to watch a sunset at the beach. If there are clear skies where you are, find yourself a west-facing coast — or anywhere else that gives you a good view low to the western horizon — and remain in place once the sun has set. Bright Venus, at magnitude +4.9, will become almost instantly visible high above the sunset point, but keep your eyes peeled, and you'll see much dimmer Saturn and Mercury, at magnitude 1.1 and 1.2, respectively, barely a degree apart. Saturn will be on the left, and Mercury on the right. — Jamie Carter With the moon down, the next week is perfect for spotting some of winter's best constellations before they fade. One of the faintest but most worth finding is Cancer. A mere Y-shape of stars between Gemini and Leo, Cancer is easy to find in the east tonight, halfway between Pollux in Gemini and Regulus in Leo, below. Within Cancer is the Beehive Cluster (M44), which you can see with the naked eye under (really) dark skies far from light pollution. — Jamie Carter High in the sky this month, you'll find a bevy of bright stars, one of the brightest of which is Capella. Known as the \"Goat Star\" in antiquity, Capella is the brightest star in the constellation Auriga, the charioteer. This week, It can be found making a square shape with Betelgeuse in Orion and the planets Jupiter and Mars. — Jamie Carter The last quarter moon is tonight, and our natural satellite is seen rising half-lit around midnight. Over the next week, it will wane to a slim crescent moon, rising later each night. This period is ideal for stargazing because the night skies will become increasingly dark. Light pollution in cities may be rampant and increasing, but it's surprising how few people know that the real culprit for bleached night skies is, in fact, a bright moon. — Jamie Carter It's an awkwardly timed sight for most, but if you can stay up very late or get up very early, there's a chance to see the moon rise in the southeast with one of the prettiest stars. Red supergiant star Antares, which translates as 'rival of Mars' because of its ruddy hues, will be barely a degree above the 44%-illuminated waning crescent moon. Antares, the heart of the constellation Scorpius, sits over the bright central core of our Milky Way galaxy. — Jamie Carter Tonight, Venus — shining at a brilliant magnitude -4.9 as the \"Evening Star\" — will be closest to the sun, something astronomers call perihelion. It's got the most circular of all the planets, according to In-The-Sky.org, so it's particularly noticeable, but take any excuse to look at Earth's sister planet while you still can. It's now a few days past its brightest, but it's perfectly placed for seeing dominate the western sky immediately after sunset. If you have a small telescope, point it at Venus, and you'll see that it's a 28%-illuminated crescent. That can only happen to the two inner planets, Venus and Mercury, as seen from Earth. — Jamie Carter You've read the hype around supermoons, but what about the opposite? While a supermoon is an astrological term for a perigee moon — when the moon is closest to Earth, so bigger in the sky — but there isn't a name for the opposite scenario. Tonight sees what might be termed a 'mini-moon' — an apogee moon, the moon at its farthest point from Earth. Now a waning gibbous moon, it will rise about three hours after sunset and appear slightly smaller than its average size. — Jamie Carter If you're in a dark location, far from light pollution, look west about an hour after sunset for a subtle triangle of light above the sunset point. A subtle but unmistakable sight, this so-called zodiacal light is photons reflected by dust particles in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. It should be visible until the moon appears in the post-sunset sky again on Feb. 28, 2025. — Jamie Carter Since the best moonsets occur in the west before sunrise, few observers pay any attention. However, there's something special on offer this morning in the shape of Spica, which will be even closer than last night. The blueish star, about 250 light-years from the solar system, will appear just a degree above a 79%-illuminated waning gibbous moon. — Jamie Carter There is no better month to look at the stars of Taurus, one of the most famous and beautiful constellations in the night sky. The key to finding Taurus is identifying reddish Aldebaran and then locating the stars' V-shape around it. There's a light to help guide the way at present — bright Jupiter, an interloper that just happens to be passing through Taurus. Beyond Jupiter are Elnath and Tianguan, the points of the bull's horns. However hard you want to learn the stars of Taurus, your eyes will likely be drawn to the sparkling open cluster of stars nearby — the Pleiades or Seven Sisters. — Jamie Carter There isn't just one night in 2025 to observe Venus. However, Feb. 16 will offer an exceptional view because the \"evening star\" will be at its closest point to Earth. It will shine at an apparent magnitude of -4.9. A couple of hours after Venus has set in the west a couple of hours after sunset, an 81%-illuminated waning gibbous moon will appear in the east just above Spica, the brightest star in the constellation Virgo. — Jamie Carter 'Spring up, fall down' is how to remember where the Big Dipper is during the year. So what about winter? Look to the north tonight a couple of hours after dark, and you'll see the Big Dipper rising on its side. At the top will be the bowl stars, Dubhe and Merak, with Alkaid at the tip of the handle lower on the horizon. Go to the left from Dubhe and Merak and you'll come to Polaris, the North Star, which Earth's northern axis points straight at. Go to the left, and you'll come to Cassiopeia, the W-shaped constellation of seven stars. Both the Big Dipper and Cassiopeia are circumpolar, eternally spinning around Polaris from our point of view. — Jamie Carter Today at 13:52 UTC (8:52 a.m. EST), our satellite officially reaches its full phase, with Earth positioned roughly between it and the sun. It will be best viewed as it rises above the eastern horizon during dusk at the time of moonrise where you are, with the bright star Regulus in Leo just to its right. During the next full moon, on March 13, the moon's positioning will be more precise, with the full Worm moon passing through Earth's dark umbral shadow in space to cause a total lunar eclipse — the first anywhere on the planet since 2022. North and South America will have the best views. — Jamie Carter Read more: Total lunar eclipse March 2025: When and where to see the next 'Blood Moon' lunar eclipse It's often overlooked because of more famous shapes of stars nearby, but knowing how to find Canis Major, the great dog, should be a stargazing staple. Not least because it's so easy to find its brightest star, Sirius, the \"Dog Star.\" At just 8.6 light-years from the solar system, it's the closest and brightest star visible above the equator, shining at a magnitude of -1.4. Orion's belt points straight at it, low on the southern horizon as seen from the Northern Hemisphere. Although they're much dimmer than Sirius, see if you can pick out the other tars in Canis Major — notably Adhara, Wezen and Aludra. — Jamie Carter Can you see the galaxy in 3D? Look east after sunset, and you’ll find a 97%-illuminated waning gibbous moon shining brightly. Above it will be Mars, and to its right will be Procyon, the brightest star in the Canis Minor constellation. The moon is a mere 238,606 miles (384,000 kilometers) from Earth, Mars about 153 million miles (246 million km) and Procyon 11.4 light-years. Procyon is one of the closest stars, yet the moon is approximately 0.000000356% as far from Earth as Procyon, and Mars is about 0.000228% as far away. The solar system may seem vast, but stars are incredibly far away. — Jamie Carter For an hour after sunset tonight, look to the west, and you’ll see bright Venus — now shining at a magnitude -4.8 — just to the lower-left of a large square of four bright stars of roughly equal brightness at each of the four corners. That’s the Great Square of Pegasus, the core shape of the constellation Pegasus, a winged horse of Greek mythology. The four stars are Scheat, Alpheratz, Markab and Algenib, with Venus visible close to the latter two. Below Venus will be Saturn, shining at a far dimmer magnitude of 1.1. — Jamie Carter The constellation Orion, the hunter, rides high in February. Look directly east after dark tonight, and you’ll immediately see a bright 86%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon. Go to the right, and you’ll quickly come to Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka, the three bright stars that make up Orion’s Belt. Between the belt stars and the moon is reddish Betelgeuse, while beyond them is bluish Rigel. — Jamie Carter Look to the east as soon as it gets dark, and you’ll see a 93%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon between golden-colored Mars on its right and bright star Pollux on its left. Pollux, the brightest star in the constellation Gemini and 34 light-years distant, has an orangey color while Mars, despite being the ‘red planet,’ will have a distinctly golden hue. Tonight, it’s 109 million kilometers from Earth. — Jamie Carter Look to the southeast as soon as it gets dark, and you’ll see a 68%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon above two bright points of light. The closest to it is Jupiter, now shining at -2.5 magnitude, with Aldebaran below. About 66 light-years from the solar system, Aldebaran is a red supergiant star and the “eye of the bull” in the constellation Taurus. — Jamie Carter A 57%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon will pass close to the Pleiades open star cluster tonight. It will create a picturesque scene in the night sky that astrophotographers can return to again every month during 2025. Two bright points of light — Jupiter and bright star Aldebaran — will be beneath the moon and the Pleiades. — Jamie Carter Overnight tonight, the moon will reach its first quarter phase, which will see its right half illuminated from Earth’s point of view. A first-quarter moon rises around midday and sets around midnight, so this is when the early evening skies get bleached by moonlight. Stargazing will become more difficult until the moon reaches its last quarter phase on Feb. 20, when it will rise around midnight and set around midday. — Jamie Carter The night sky tonight is at something of a crossroads. It’s now a day past a cross-quarter day called Candlemas in the Christian religion that marks the sun’s midway point between the winter solstice and the spring equinox. However, there’s one marker of the night sky that may appear to be season but is anything but. Look south after sunset; you’ll see a 34%-illuminated crescent moon shining brightly. Venus will be between it and the southwestern horizon, shining at magnitude -4.8. It’s been this way for a few months, but don’t take the sight of Venus after sunset for granted. At its brightest in the evening sky from Jan. 28 through Feb. 27 in 2025, it will reach its greatest brilliancy on Feb. 14. However, it will quickly sink into the western horizon as it disappears into the sun’s glare by mid-March. Venus has no annual pattern as seen from Earth. That’s because, as an inner planet, it orbits faster than Earth — just over 13 times for every eight orbits by Earth. It, therefore, has a cycle of Earth visibility that repeats every eight Earth years. Just beyond Venus will be a much dimmer Saturn. — Jamie Carter Look to the southwest immediately after sunset, and you'll see a beautiful conjunction of a 7%-illuminated waxing crescent moon and Saturn emerging in the twilight. The two will be separated by barely a degree. Saturn will, at +1.1 magnitude, be relatively dim. So it may take substantial darkness to see it. — Jamie Carter If you thought yesterday's conjunction of the crescent moon and Saturn was spectacular, wait until you see tonight's sight. Venus will blaze away in the southwest after sunset, shining at -4.7 magnitude. Just two degrees to the left will be a 14%-illuminated waxing crescent moon. Venus is now just two weeks from being the brightest it will get during its current apparition as the \"Evening Star.\" — Jamie Carter Tonight, the waxing crescent moon, now 23%-illuminated, will be visible high above bright Venus. However, it will remain a terrific sight, with its darkened limb lit up by \"Earthshine\" — sunlight reflected from Earth's oceans, snow and ice back onto the moon. High above the trio will be bright Jupiter and, beyond it, Mars. — Jamie Carter This won't be easy, and you may need binoculars but don't miss the chance — if the skies are clear — to glimpse a young waxing crescent moon emerging from the sun's glare. It will be visible briefly as a very slim crescent just after sunset when just over 2.5% of its surface is lit by the sun. Look to the west about 15 minutes after the sun dips beneath the horizon. — Jamie Carter At 7:36 a.m. EST today, the moon will slip roughly between Earth and the sun, completing its orbit and entering its new moon phase. There's nothing to see because the moon will be lost in the sun's glare and there's no eclipse (that will next happen on Mar. 29), but there is a reason for stargazers to celebrate. Not only will the lack of moonlight at night make skies as dark as possible, but the next four or so evenings will feature a beautifully slim waxing crescent moon in the post-sunset sky. Check for a clear sky, grab a warm coat and spend at least 20 minutes outside to allow your eyes to adjust to the dark. — Jamie Carter Tomorrow's new moon will signal the beginning of the Lunar New Year (also called Chinese New Year) and Year of the Snake, which will continue through Feb. 16, 2026, when the Year of the Horse begins. Draco, the dragon, is a faint shape of stars that traces a serpent's tail between the constellations of Hercules, Cepheus, Ursa Minor and Ursa Major. Look north as late as you can tonight to find its tail zigzagging between Polaris, the North Star, and the Big Dipper. — Jamie Carter Look to the southwest after dark and find Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. You can do that by finding the easily recognizable stars of Orion's Belt and following a line through them to the horizon. Once you have Sirius in your sights, look for Procyon, the brightest star in Canis Minor, to its left. Now look for reddish Betelgeuse, in Orion, above them. Join them together to make an isosceles triangle — the Winter Triangle — which will be visible until April. — Jamie Carter Antares is a red supergiant star in the constellation Scorpius. To the naked eye, it looks orangey-red (which is easiest to see if you squint at it). Its name means \"rival of Mars\" because the red planet sometimes passes close to it, confusing skywatchers. The two won't get close until September 2025, so there'll be no mistaking them this morning before sunrise when a 26%-illuminated waning crescent moon shines 0.3 degrees from Antares. — Jamie Carter You'll have noticed by now this month that there are a lot of planets around and that there's also a lot of hype about it. Look west after sunset, and you'll find Venus and Saturn, with Jupiter high in the south and Mars above the east. They're the naked-eye planets, but there will be a couple of other dim telescopic worlds weaved into the \"planet parade,\" too, namely Uranus close to Jupiter and Neptune near Venus. Ignore the hype about them being \"lined up.\" All planets orbit the ecliptic — the path of the sun across our sky — so they are always visible in something of a line across the sky. — Jamie Carter Ask any stargazer or astrophotographer for the best time to see and image the Milky Way; they'll tell you from April through November. That's the time to see its bright center, but if you want to see its spiral arms — and the Orion Arm in particular — January is the best month. Ever wondered why you can see so many more bright stars from the Northern Hemisphere in winter than in summer? It's because the solar system is part of the Orion Arm, and during winter, we get a great view of it and see much closer, brighter stars. It may not have the brightness of the summer Milky Way, but on a dark night, you can see a faint band of white light — the combined glow of billions of stars — across the winter sky. — Jamie Carter This month is ideal for observing Mars. All month, it will shine at -1.3 magnitude around the constellation Gemini. Tonight, it gets closest to one of its stars. Look about two degrees to its left, and you'll see orangey Pollux, the brightest star in Gemini. Pollux is just 34 light-years from the solar system. Just above, and forming a triangle with the pair, will be slightly dimmer, blue-white Castor, 52 light-years from the solar system. The contrast in colors — the golden color of Mars, the orange of Pollux and the blue-white of Castor — will provide a spectacular view. If you can't see the colors easily, squint at the stars until you do. In stargazing, patience and perseverance are everything. — Jamie Carter This month, stargazers will be fixated on the constellation Orion, which will be prominent in the southeast after dark. It's hard to take your eyes off it; its stars are just so bright and, in the case of the three stars in Orion's Belt, so perfectly aligned as seen from Earth. Look on the other side of those three stars, and you'll see two of winter's most impressive stars — Betelgeuse and Rigel. They're found on opposite sides of Orion's Belt. Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star 548 light-years away. Almost 800 light-years away, Rigel is a blue-white supergiant star and the brightest star in Orion. Both will eventually go supernova. — Jamie Carter The moon regularly appears to pass near several bright stars each month, including Aldebaran, Pollux, Regulus, Antares and Spica. However, rarely are the apparent passes as close as tonight's conjunction of a waning gibbous moon and Spica. Look to the east from the early hours until sunrise, and you'll see an almost half-lit moon just 0.1 of a degree from the brightest star in the constellation of Virgo. During 2025, the moon will pass very close to it every month. At 3:31 p.m. EST today, the moon will reach its last quarter phase, which will rise at midnight and set at midday. — Jamie Carter At this time of year, all eyes turn to the Orion constellation. Its bright stars are just too much to ignore. However, look below it, and you'll find another far less familiar constellation. Becoming visible late at night as Orion rises higher in the sky, look immediately underneath the brightest star in Orion, blue-white Rigel, and keep to the right of dazzling Sirius. You'll find 11 stars that make the shape of a rabbit. The second and sixth planets from the sun will begin a two-night conjunction tonight, but you'll have to quickly see it after sunset because the two planets will sink below the horizon soon after. Venus will shine at -4.6 magnitude in the southwest after sunset and be easy to find. Look about two degrees to its left, and you'll find a much dimmer Saturn shining at +1.1 magnitude. If it's cloudy, don't worry — there's another chance tomorrow. — Jamie Carter Read more: Venus and Saturn take a sunset stroll tonight. Here's how to see it The conjunction of Venus and Saturn continues tonight as the sky darkens at sunset, this time with Saturn below Venus as the planets edge along their orbital paths. The two planets will once again be about two degrees from each other. With Saturn inching closer to the sun (it will be at solar conjunction on March 12) and Venus still rising, a close conjunction of the two planets was inevitable. — Jamie Carter What's the brightest star in the night sky? That's easy — go outside tonight a couple of hours after sunset, and you'll see it with your own eyes. In the east below Orion's stars will be Sirius, the brightest star in Canis Major. Just 8.6 light-years from the solar system, it's the fifth closest star system known and one of the sun's nearest neighbors. Shining at -1.45 magnitude, it shouldn't be hard to find. If you struggle, here's a tip — Orion's Belt points almost straight down at it. — Jamie Carter Now 89%-illuminated, the waning gibbous moon will rise late at night and be positioned close to Regulus, the brightest star in the constellation Leo and just 79 light-years from the solar system. They'll appear to be about two degrees from each other, with Regulus above the moon. — Jamie Carter One of the best-known constellations in the northern sky, the winged horse, Pegasus, is visible just above the planets Venus and Saturn after dark this month. Look directly above the pair for bright star Algenib and then search for the other three stars that make up the \"Great Square of Pegasus\" — Alpheratz (right), Scheat (top) and Markab (bottom). The horse's legs splay out to the right from Scheat, while bright star Enif, to the right of Venus and Saturn, is the horse's muzzle. Enif is an orange supergiant star about 12 times as massive as the sun and 690 light-years from the solar system. — Jamie Carter The first full moon of 2025, the \"Wolf Moon,\" will move across and block the planet Mars tonight. Moreover, Mars will be shining at the brightest it will get during a four-year period. Now at -1.4 magnitude, the red planet will be hidden by the moon, as seen only from North America, between 8:44 p.m. EST and ending at 00:52 a.m. EST on Tuesday, Jan. 14. The exact times of ht planet's ingress (disseverance) and egress (re-appearance) will depend on your location, for which In-the-sky.org provides a map. Regardless of geography, everyone worldwide will be able to watch the \"Wolf Moon\" appear on the eastern horizon during dusk today. — Jamie Carter Venus gradually gets higher and brighter in the sky as it approaches Earth. Tonight, it reaches its greatest elongation east — it is farthest from the sun in its current apparition, as seen from Earth. It will be positioned 47.2 degrees from the sun and will be visible above west-southwest for about three hours after sunset. You'll find a dimmer Saturn to its left. — Jamie Carter A dichotomy — or division — of the second planet from the sun occurs today as its phase resembles the moon in its first and last quarter. Precisely half-lit tonight, just a couple of days after it appeared highest in the post-sunset sky, Venus will henceforth shrink from a half-moon shape as it retreats into the sun's glare on Mar. 20. — Jamie Carter Tonight, Mars will make its closest approach to Earth since Dec. 8, 2022. Now moving through the constellation Cancer, it's just days away from being 100%-illuminated by the sun as seen from Earth, an occasion called opposition by astronomers. It will be 59,703,891 miles (96,084,099 kilometers) distant tonight and shine at an impressively bright -1.4 magnitude. — Jamie Carter One of the closest open clusters of stars to the solar system, the Pleiades (or \"Seven Sisters\"), is in the constellation of Taurus and positioned close to the ecliptic, the sun's path through the sky. Since the moon orbits relatively close to the ecliptic, it must pass across the Pleiades regularly for a short period every six or so years. In 2025, it will do just that, with this first of many similar conjunctions this year seeing an 80%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon pass less than a degree from the center of the Pleiades. Look southeast anytime after dark for the pair, though binoculars will give you the best view. — Jamie Carter Three stars that you'll have no trouble finding in the glare of the waxing gibbous moon are Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka, a trio of stars comprising the famous asterism (shape of stars) called Orion's Belt. Situated at the core of the constellation of Orion, the hunter, they shine at 1.8-magnitude, 1.7-magnitude and 2.4-magnitude, respectively, and will be visible above the southeast. — Jamie Carter Look high in the south after dark tonight for the bright planet Jupiter shining at -2.7 magnitude. It’s directly above orange-reddish star Aldebaran, whose name means “eye of the bull,” and slightly to the left of the Pleiades, an open cluster of stars. The stars of a looser-looking open cluster of stars, the Hyades, surround Aldebaran. See if you can make out the constellation Taurus, the bull, specifically the tips of the bull’s horns, beyond Jupiter — Elnath (top) and Tianguan (bottom). — Jamie Carter Tonight at 6:56 EST, the moon will reach its first quarter phase, which will see it half-lit from Earth’s point of view. A first-quarter moon rises around midday and sets around midnight, so this is when the early evening skies get bleached by moonlight. Stargazing will become more difficult until the moon reaches its last quarter phase on Jan. 21, when it will rise around midnight and set around midday. — Jamie Carter Now 18%-illuminated, the waxing crescent moon will shine less than two degrees from Venus in the eastern sky after dark and Saturn above the moon. As you watch the trio sink toward the horizon, watch for fireballs from the first meteor shower of the year. About 120 shooting stars per hour — some very bright — can sometimes be seen from the peak of the Quadrantids, which happens right after dark. They're caused by dust and debris left in the inner solar system by a comet or asteroid (astronomers aren't sure which) called 2003 EH1. — Jamie Carter Tonight the waxing crescent moon, now 28%-illuminated, will shine just above Saturn, with Venus shining brightly below. Prepare for plenty more sights like this in 2025, with some terrifically close moon-Venus conjunctions coming up in the early months as the second planet from the sun reaches its brilliant best. — Jamie Carter Look to the southwest after dark, and you'll see a now 39%-illuminated waxing crescent moon high above Saturn and Venus below. The ringed planet will shine at mag. 1 while Venus will be at mag. -4.5, near to the brightest it will get in its current apparition as the \"Evening Star.\" — Jamie Carter A 10%-illuminated waxing crescent moon will be below bright Venus tonight, with Saturn farther above. The moon will set soon after, so don't waste time taking in this one. — Jamie Carter It's been an exceptional year for stargazers, from April 8's total solar eclipse and global auroras to a comet and much more. Why not ponder all that — and look forward to the celestial delights of 2025 — by looking south shortly before midnight? You'll see the winter night sky at its very best, with this region of sky containing the stars of Orion, the Orion Nebula, the Pleiades, bright Sirus and, of course, both Jupiter and Mars. — Jamie Carter Here's a great way to ring in a new year of sky-watching. Get somewhere with a low view of the southwest horizon and wait for sunset. Once the sun has dipped below the horizon, look for a 5%-illuminated waxing crescent moon. You may need binoculars to spot its slim against a blueish twilight sky. Be quick because the moon will set soon after sunset. Venus and Saturn will be far above. — Jamie Carter Today at 5:38 p.m. EST is a New Moon, which makes tonight perfect for stargazing. Look to the southwest soon after sunset, and you'll see two bright planets, Saturn and Venus, very close together, with the ringed planet a few degrees above. Look to the left of Venus, and you'll find bright star Fomalhaut, the brightest in the constellation Piscis Austrinus, the Southern Fish, forming a triangle with the two solar system objects. A double star about 25 light-years behind the two planets, Fomalhaut is one of the four Royal Stars of ancient Persian culture, which calls it the \"Watcher of the South.\" — Jamie Carter If you're up and looking low to the southeastern horizon about an hour before sunrise, you'll come across a lovely tableau of a 12%-illuminated waning crescent moon approaching Mercury, which will shine at mag. -0.3 this morning. Antares, the brightest and reddest star in the constellation Scorpius, will be almost between the two. If you want to catch a super-slim-waning crescent moon, with just 6% of its surface lit by the sun, be up and looking to the southeast an hour before sunrise. As a bonus, it will shine just a fraction of a degree from reddish Antares. Look to the southeast after dark for Mars, now shining brightly at mag. -1.2, then high above to its right for Jupiter, at a brighter mag. -2.8. Now come down to the horizon for Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, which always shines at -1.45, so a little brighter than Mars tonight. The three should form a triangle. As well as being the brightest points of light in that part of the night sky, they're also the closest. Every other star you can see in the sky tonight is far behind these three — though Sirius, at 8.6 light-years distant, is a lot farther away than the planets. If you've received a telescope or a pair of binoculars for Christmas, there's only one thing to put them on as soon as it gets dark. Found to the lower right of Orion's Belt in the eastern sky, the Orion Nebula — also called M42 — is a star nursery about 1,300 light-years from the solar system. Although it looks spectacular in optics, it's also visible to the naked eye; look just to the side of it to appreciate its brightness in your peripheral vision. What's more impressive — a bearded man delivering presents to the world's children in one night or a human-built space station traveling faster than a speeding bullet 250 miles above? Either way, you can see the International Space Station fly across the sky frequently if you know when and where to look. Check NASA's Spot The Station website to see if you can see the ISS this Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. What you tell the kids is up to you. — Jamie Carter Read more: Could that be Santa's sleigh? Early risers can spot the ISS from the UK this Christmas Three stars will be prominent above the southeast after dark — Orion's Belt. These three stars — Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka — can be used to find other, arguably more important stars nearby. Take an imaginary line from the top of the belt to the bottom and keep going towards the horizon, and you'll come to an unmistakably bright, blueish star. Sirius is one of the closest stars to the solar system at 8.6 light-years. It's also the brightest star in the night sky, with a mag. of −1.46. — Jamie Carter If you're up early on Christmas Eve, look to the southeast for a glimpse of the waning crescent moon, now 35%-illuminated, less than a degree from Spica, the brightest star in the constellation Virgo and about 261 light-years from the solar system. Below the pair, due southeast, Mercury and reddish star Antares will rise shortly before the sun. Today at 4:17 a.m. EST is the solstice, the longest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere and the shortest in the Southern Hemisphere. The sun won't rise in the Arctic Circle, and in the Antarctic Circle, it won't set. It's all down to Earth's axis being tilted by 23.5º relative to the plane of Earth's orbit around the sun. You can see solstice: glance at the sun today around midday, and it will be the lowest it gets in the year. — Jamie Carter It's the Last Quarter Moon tonight, which sees the moon rise around midnight. Long before that, just before sunrise, it may be possible to spot Mercury. The elusive inner planet is typically close to the sun but occasionally rises high enough into the sky to be seen from Earth. This morning, it reaches its highest point of its current apparition, shining at mag. -0.2. Don't confuse it with Antares, the brightest star in the constellation Scorpius, which will be a little dimmer at mag. 0.9, but has a similarly reddish color. We see the peak of the Ursid meteor shower tonight, but the presence of a waning gibbous moon — which will rise into the night sky before midnight — will make its five to 10 meteors per hour hard to see. — Jamie Carter It's perhaps the most famous constellation in the night sky, but how well do you know Orion, the hunter? Let's start with its three bright \"belt\" stars — Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka — aligned vertically above the east as darkness sets in tonight. Now, find the four bright stars at their corners. Left of the belt stars is reddish Betelgeuse, with Rigel on its right. Above the belt stars is Bellatrix, and below is Saiph. Find those, and you'll also notice a fuzzy glowing object between the belt star, Saiph and Rigel. That's the Orion Nebula, also called M42, where stars are being born. — Jamie Carter Look anytime from the small hours through dawn, and you'll see, moving from southeast to southwest, a 73%-illuminated waning gibbous moon just a couple of degrees from Regulus, the brightest star in the constellation Leo, the lion. It's 78 light-years distant and the 21st brightest star in the night sky. — Jamie Carter Look to the east about four hours after sunset, and you'll see a bright waning gibbous moon, now 84%-illuminated, hanging below Mars. Above the pair will be the bright stars Pollux and Castor in Gemini. Together, the four will form a crescent of four lights that get steadily dimmer as you go further from the moon. — Jamie Carter Look east a few hours after dark, and you'll easily see a 90% illuminated waning gibbous moon. Just a degree or so below will be red Mars, shining brightly at mag. -1 as it approaches its bright opposition in January. The planet will pass closest to Earth on Jan. 12, 2025, and align with Earth and the sun four days later. — Jamie Carter The now-waning gibbous moon might bleach the sky, but the stars are so bright in the east this month after dark that you should have no problem completing this star-hop. First, look for the three bright stars of Orion's Belt, lined up vertically above the eastern horizon a couple of hours after sunset. On the left will be the reddish giant Betelgeuse, and on the right will be the blueish giant Rigel. Draw an imaginary line from Rigel through the belt stars to two bright stars arranged vertically, Castor and Pollux in Gemini. Tonight, the moon, which both stars are to the left of, gives you a helping hand. As a bonus, Mars will be shining below Gemini. — Jamie Carter Its up to 120 meteors per hour make it officially the year's most prolific meteor shower, yet the Geminids will underperform in 2024. You can thank the waxing gibbous moon, which will be 97% illuminated tonight and so bleach the sky. It will, therefore, be tricky to see any but the brightest colorful shooting stars produced as Earth smashes into the trail of debris left in the inner solar system by asteroid 3200 Phaethon. — Jamie Carter Read more: Geminid meteor shower peaks tonight! Here's how to see one of the best meteor showers of the year Editor's note: You can also watch the Geminid meteor shower live online from the comfort of your own home courtesy of Astronomer Gianluca Masi of the Virtual Telescope Project. The livestream is scheduled to start at 6:00 p.m. EST (2300 GMT) on Dec. 13, weather permitting. Now on the cusp of being a full moon, our natural satellite glides past the constellation Taurus tonight. As it does so, it will align with bright Jupiter and orangey-reddish supergiant star Aldebaran, the brightest star in Taurus and about 65 light-years from our sun. — Jamie Carter Rising in the east during dusk will be one of the month's most dramatic and beautiful celestial sights of the month — the full \"Cold Moon.\" Also known as the \"Moon Before Yule\" and the \"Long Nights Moon,\" it will turn full at 4:01 a.m. EST. As a bonus, as the full moon rises, it will form an equilateral triangle with Jupiter above its right and bright red supergiant stars Betelgeuse to its lower right. — Jamie Carter The glare of the waxing gibbous moon, 92% illuminated tonight, is now washing out many faint stars. However, between the moon and the eastern horizon, you can easily pick out bright Jupiter shining at mag. -2.4. To its right will be Aldebaran in Taurus, but the spectacular open star cluster of the Pleiades will be between the giant planet and the moon. — Jamie Carter It's one of the most famous asterisms (a shape of stars, but not an official constellation) in the summer night sky, but tonight the Summer Triangle continues its post-sunset farewell with an extra point of light. Look southwest shortly after sunset, and you'll see Deneb in Cygnus (top), bright Vega in Lyra (below Deneb), and Altair in Aquila (left of Vega) form their usual triangle. This unmistakable shape of stars all this week points like an arrow at Venus, shining at mag -4.2 above southwest. — Jamie Carter Look southeast after dark, and you'll see the bright planet Jupiter. Tonight, use it as a guiding light to find one of the night sky's most spectacular sights — the Pleiades. Pronounced \"Plee-err-deez,\" this open cluster of seven bright stars (or six to older eyes) shine together in the constellation Taurus. Also known as \"Seven Sisters\" and M45, the Pleiades are all hot, young stars a mere 445 light-years away from the solar system. Their intense starlight illuminates clouds of gas and dust between them. Get the Pleiades in your peripheral vision to appreciate their collective brightness. — Jamie Carter Look east after sunset tonight for the bright planet Jupiter shining at mag. -2.8. It's firmly in the clutches of the constellation Taurus, \"the bull.\" Just to Jupiter's right will be orange-reddish star Aldebaran, whose name means \"eye of the bull.\" Around Aldebaran, you'll see a smattering of stars in a V-shape. That's the Hyades, one of the closest open clusters of stars to the solar system, at around 150 light-years. — Jamie Carter Look to the southwest after dark, and you'll see a beautifully balanced panorama of the waxing crescent moon, now 32%-illuminated, flanked by two of the solar system's most beautiful planets. Below the moon will be Venus, shining brightly at mag. -4.1, while above will be Saturn, the ringed planet, at mag 1. Just beyond Saturn, but hidden to the naked eye, will be the dim seventh planet Neptune. — Jamie Carter Jupiter will rise gloriously in the east after dark tonight as soon as the sun sets in the west. It's a special day for the \"King of Planets\" because, as seen from Earth, it reaches opposition, the night when Earth passes between it and the sun. The planet's disk will be 100% illuminated as seen from Earth, and Jupiter will look at its brightest and best for all of 2024. If you have binoculars, you'll be able to see some of its four Galilean moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. If you have a small telescope, you'll see its colorful cloud belts. Don't worry if it's cloudy — because Jupiter will be bright and visible all night for the rest of the month. — Jamie Carter In the southern sky after dark, you'll find a half-lit moon at its first quarter phase when its entire right-hand side (from the Northern Hemisphere) is illuminated. Look for three dark patches in a row on the moon's lit side — ancient lava pains called maria — called the \"seas\" of Serenity, Tranquility and Fertility. Just below and to the right will be Saturn, shining at mag. 1. — Jamie Carter Here's another spectacular sight of the crescent moon and Venus together for a third night. Although not in as close a conjunction as yesterday, tonight, the waxing crescent moon — now 22%-illuminated — will shine to the upper-left of Venus. More views of the waxing crescent moon and Venus are coming early in 2025. — Jamie Carter Last night Kevin McCarthy captured this beautiful photograph of the moon and Venus from Charlotte, North Carolina, U.S. You should be able to catch a similar view tonight where Venus will appear to the moon's lower right, pending clear skies! \"The pairing just as the sun set allowed some blue to remain in the sky at the time I took this shot. I think that adds to the photo instead of the normal pitch-black background,\" McCarthy told Space.com in an email. — Daisy Dobrijevic Now 14%-illuminated, the waxing crescent moon will today shine just a couple of degrees from Venus in the eastern sky after dark. The planet is brightening as it gets closer to Earth, though paradoxically, less of its disk is on show. Tonight, it's in a 66%-illuminated gibbous phase and shines at mag. -4.2, but by February, it will become a 13%-illuminated crescent yet shine at mag. -4.8. It will shine more brightly despite less of its disk being lit by the sun for two reasons — it will be much closer, and the clouds in its atmosphere reflect a lot of light. — Jamie Carter Look to the southwest an hour after sunset, and you'll see a 7%-illuminated waxing crescent moon in Sagittarius, just below bright Venus. The moon will set soon after, so don't waste time. — Jamie Carter After yesterday's\" New Cold Moon,\" the skies will be dark and perfect for stargazing. Look to the northeast, and you'll see Jupiter shining at magnitude -2.8, one of the brightest lights in the night sky. To its upper-left will be Capella, the brightest star in the constellation Auriga. Going anti-clockwise from Capella, see if you can pick out the constellation's four other bright stars — Menkalinan, Mahisim, Elnath and Hassaleh — circling toward Jupiter and back. — Jamie Carter Today, it's Native American Heritage Day in the U.S., an excellent opportunity to see and interpret the night sky in a way familiar to Indigenous people in North America. It's not an exact science because there are multiple Indigenous tribes and cultures, but one familiar shape of stars in the night sky is the Western constellation of Orion. Centered on the three bright stars that make up the famous Orion's Belt, which rises in the east about three hours after sunset tonight — is Átsé Ets'ózí (First Slim One), a male image in Najavo culture that uses Orion's Sword as a knee. In Ojibwe culture, the stars Procyon in Canis Minor and Aldebaran in Taurus are added to form a vast figure called Biboonkeonini (The Wintermaker). — Jamie Carter Related: The Native American night sky: 7 starry sights to see As we reach the end of November, Mars becomes a pre-midnight object. Get outside and look to the east shortly before that time. The red planet rises below a panorama of bright stars, including Betelgeuse, Rigel, Orion's belt, Capella and Sirius. However, closer to it, you'll see it make a triangle shape with Procyon in the constellation Canis Minor (the eighth-brightest star in the night sky), to its right and above, the bright golden star Pollux in Gemini. — Jamie Carter With a new moon imminent, it's the perfect moonless night to get a grip on one of the largest and most impressive star-hops possible to make in Earth's night sky. Get outside after 10:00 p.m. local time and look to the southeast for a mess of bright stars. Make a circle (or hexagon?) out of them, going anti-clockwise from the bottom. First, find Sirus — the brightest star in the night sky — then go above-right to Rigel in Orion, to the right of the hunter's three belt stars. Now go up to orangey Aldebaran (don't confuse it with interloper Jupiter), then above-left to Capella high in the sky, then directly down to two stars together, Pollux and Castor in Gemini. Now go below-right to Procyon (ignoring Mars, just outside the circle)and below-right again back to Sirius. Practice finding and naming these stars, and you can level up your stargazing knowledge. — Jamie Carter A delicate crescent moon will grace the night sky about two hours before sunrise today — Thanksgiving in the U.S. Just 7%-illuminated, it will rise in the east and sine below bright stars Spica (above) and Arcturus (above and left). Use a pair of binoculars to see \"Earthshine\" — sunlight reflected from Earth's day side and onto the moon's night side. — Jamie Carter Look north, preferably about four hours after sunset, and you'll see one constellation that will be unmistakable. Cassiopeia is typically described as a W-shaped constellation, but tonight, it will look more like an M. A circumpolar constellation that revolves around the north star, Polaris, it's almost always in the northern hemisphere's night sky. In fall, it rides high and takes over from another famous shape of stars, the Big Dipper of Plough. That particular asterism (not an official constellation) is currently low on the horizon, as in the memory aid \"spring up, fall down.\" — Jamie Carter From about two hours before sunset, the beautiful sight of a 13%-illuminated waning crescent moon will be visible in the east just half a degree above Spica, the brightest star in the constellation Spica and one of the 20 brightest stars in the night sky. However, if you're in the eastern half of the U.S., eastern Canada or the north-western Bahamas, and you're in position looking to the southeast at around 5:35 a.m. EST, you'll see Spica disappear behind the moon's crescent. It will reappear about 75 minutes later, though the sky will be bright by then. Binoculars will help, as will this detailed map from In-The-Sky.org, which will also give you the specific timings for your exact location. — Jamie Carter If you have a clear sky, watch a sunset in the west. However, what happens after that is interesting. Swivel 180 degrees to face east, and you'll see a dark blue band appear on the horizon with a deep pink color above. The blue band will rise as you watch it, and the pink will dissipate. Astronomers call it the Belt of Venus, but what is it? It's Earth's shadow being projected onto its atmosphere. It will soon combine with night and disappear. — Jamie Carter Look to the east shortly before midnight tonight, and you'll see Mars — now shining unmistakably red as it gets closer to Earth — forming a loose triangle with bright star Procyon to its right and the \"twins\" of Gemini, Castor and Pollux, just above it. If you have keen eyes, dark skies, or a pair of binoculars, look for the Beehive Cluster (M44) just below the red planet. This star cluster is 610 light-years away in the constellation Cancer. Wait an hour, and the half-illuminated last quarter moon will appear below, with Regulus, the brightest star in the constellation Leo, just above it. — Jamie Carter Look to the south after sunset tonight for one of the night sky's most beautiful sights, an open cluster of sparkling young blue stars in the constellation Taurus called the Pleiades. Also known as M45 and the \"seven sisters,\" these stars, just 445 light-years away from the solar system, light up the clouds of gas and dust between them, giving the cluster an innate brightness that is hard to miss. Look to the left, and you'll see the bright planet Jupiter. Trace out the stars of the constellation Taurus, the bull — most noticeable for its V-shape of stars entered on reddish star Aldebaran — and you'll see that the giant planet is between the celestial animal's horns. — Jamie Carter Dozens of significant constellations of bright stars in the sky are very famous to stargazers, but few people know. One is the constellation of Auriga (the \"charioteer\"), a near-rectangle of five stars that will be visible in the southeast after dark tonight. Its brightest star is Capella, which means goat in Latin. It's the sixth-brightest star in the night sky. The lower-right star in the constellation is Elnath, which presently has Jupiter for company. — Jamie Carter Look east at moonrise where you are (about 11:00 p.m. local time) to see the 21-day-old waning gibbous moon rise. Few people watch the moon in this phase, but it's a beautiful late-night sight. With 58% of its Earth-facing side illuminated tonight, it's the perfect time of the month to see features like Mare Imbrium and Mare Nubium (vast lava plains) and the famous Kepler and Copernicus craters (lunar craters in the Oceanus Procellarum). Above the moon will be bright Mars, with shining stars Procyon and Sirius level with the planet, farther to the right. — Jamie Carter Editor's note: Fancy taking a more in-depth tour of our rocky companion? Check out our moon observation guide to learn more about what you can see on the lunar surface. Start your sky-watching tonight 30 minutes after sunset in the southwest, when you may be able to spot Mercury, which tonight will be at its highest point in the sky during its current evening apparition. At magnitude -0.3, it may be possible to see it with the naked eye as a reddish dot. If you have binoculars, use them only after the sun has entirely set. Mercury will be below and to the right of Venus. — Jamie Carter Check out the time of moonrise where you are (about five hours after sunset) tonight in the east to see Mars and the 70%-illuminated waning gibbous moon separated by about two degrees, the width of the two of your fingers held at arm's length against the sky. Mars is shining at a magnitude of 0.3 and rapidly brightening as its distance to Earth shortens. It's currently 81 million miles (131 million kilometers) distant. Mars will get closest to Earth on Jan. 12, 2025, at 59 million miles (96 million kilometers). That happens once every 26 months, as does its opposition four days later when it will be fully lit by the sun from our point of view, so it will shine at its brightest and best. — Jamie Carter Look to the eastern night sky at the precise time of moonrise where you are tonight (about four hours after sunset), and you'll see our satellite, now looking slightly oblong, with a bright star above it. That's Pollux, a star 34 light-years distant and nine times larger than our sun. It's one of the \"twins\" of Gemini. The other, Castor, will be slightly farther above the moon. Castor isn't just one star, but six. It's 51 light-years away. — Jamie Carter Some constellations are tiny. Others are vast. Draco, the dragon, belongs to the latter camp, a vast, loose, faint shape of stars that make a vague serpent's tail between the constellations of Hercules, Cepheus, Ursa Minor and Ursa Major. Look north tonight and see if you can find the head of the dragon, four stars of equal brightness to the lower-right of bright star Vega. Its tail then zigzags its way up and then down to the Big Dipper via 11 stars, finishing due north just above Dubhe. Draco is home to the Cat's Eye Nebula (NGC 6543), the Tadpole Galaxy (UGC 10214) and the Spindle Galaxy (M102). — Jamie Carter Today, we see the rise of the full moon and its occultation of the Pleiades. For the best view of the November full moon (2024's final supermoon), be somewhere at sunset to watch the fully-lit orangey orb rise in the east into the dusk sky (check the exact time of moonrise where you are). Just after midnight, the moon will move through and cover up the \"Seven Sister\" stars, the Pleiades. However, the moon will be so bright that it will be difficult to see the Pleiades. Since the Pleiades is close to the ecliptic — the sun's path through the sky, which the moon's orbital path intersects — the moon occasionally appears to travel through this naked-eye open star cluster of stars. — Jamie Carter The almost full moon will rise a little later tonight but should have more impact than yesterday because it will appear in the east in a darker sky. Check the time of moonrise where you are and be in place to see a more profoundly orangey full moon than last night. Look above the moon, and you'll see the Pleiades open star cluster of stars, which the moon occulted last night. Look again an hour after the moonrise, and you'll see the bright planet Jupiter rise beneath the moon. — Jamie Carter Some of the fastest shooting stars of the year come from the Leonid meteor shower, which peaks close to midnight tonight. Watch from late at night tonight through dawn tomorrow, and you can typically expect fast meteors with long, bright tails and perhaps even an unexpected outburst of activity during the peak. However, even the average 15 shooting stars per hour during the peak will be tricky to see this year thanks to the presence of a bright, waning gibbous moon, which will bleach the sky and make Leonaids hard to spot. — Jamie Carter Contrary to popular belief, the North Star is not the brightest in the night sky. It's the 48th brightest and is a triple-star system, with a yellow supergiant and two smaller stars. It's simple to find and will be a valuable navigational tool for the rest of your life. First, identify the stars' W (or M) shape in the northeastern night sky after sunset tonight. That's Cassiopeia. You'll find Polaris halfway between Cassiopeia and the easily recognizable stars of the Big Dipper, which tonight will be low on the northwest horizon. Earth's northern axis points at Polaris, so it remains perfectly still as all other stars travel across the sky (because Earth rotates). Those close to Polaris appear to move in circles around it in a time-lapse. — Jamie Carter Here's a great way of getting to know the fall night sky, even from a light-polluted city. Go outside about an hour after sunset and look to the northeast. Find two bright objects — the bright Pleiades open cluster of stars in the constellation Taurus, above east-northeast and the bright, white star Capella in the constellation Auriga, above northeast. Draw an imaginary line between them. Now, look for a third star above to complete an equilateral triangle. You'll come to Mirfak, the brightest star in the constellation Perseus. It's a supergiant double star about 510 light-years distant and intrinsically 5,000 times brighter than the sun. — Jamie Carter The peak of the Southern Taurids a week ago wasn't a major event, nor is the meteor shower it spills into tonight's Northern Taurids. Peaking Monday through tonight, it will bring up to about five shooting stars per hour. Like its sister shower, it tends to produce bright fireballs, but tonight, they'll be fighting against the bright light of the waxing gibbous moon. — Jamie Carter The solar system's largest planet, Jupiter, is now approaching its best of the year. Come Dec. 7, it will reach its annual opposition when it will be relatively close to Earth at 380 million miles (612 million kilometers) and shine at a magnitude of -2.8. By then, it will rise in the east at sunset and set in the west at sunrise. With a month to go before its opposition, Jupiter is already rising in the east two hours after sunset, and now, just 388 million miles (625 million kilometers), it's already shining at a magnitude of -2.75. In short, it's beginning to dominate the night sky, which means it's time to find a pair of binoculars (to see its four giant moons) and a telescope (to see its pink cloud bands). — Jamie Carter Tonight, the waxing crescent moon becomes a waxing gibbous moon — gibbous meaning rounded — as our natural satellite becomes half-lit by the sun, as seen from Earth. For stargazers, it's a critical moment because the moon has brightened enough to begin to bleach the night sky and make faint stars more challenging to see, a situation that will get more profound during the next week as the moon waxes towards becoming a full \"Beaver Moon.\" A waxing gibbous moon is illuminated from the right, whereas a waning gibbous moon (the week after the full moon) is illuminated from the left. — Jamie Carter You probably know the prominent, iconic asterism called the Summer Triangle. It's home to the Milky Way and dominates the northern hemisphere's summer night sky. It's now long past its best, but it can still be easily seen as it sinks into the western horizon immediately after sunset tonight. It comprises three bright stars — Deneb (in the constellation Cygnus), highest in the western sky tonight; Vega (in Lyra), below right; and Altair (in Aquila), below left. The latter gets little attention. Shining above Venus, if you come outside immediately after sunset, it's a mere 17 light-years away, one of the closest stars to our solar system. In Arabic, Altair is called Al Nasr Al-Tair, which translates as the Flying Eagle (Aquila is Latin for eagle). It spins on its axis once every 10 hours. — Jamie Carter Look southwest after dark; you'll see a bright 37%-illuminated waxing crescent moon approaching two shining points of light due south. The upper point will be the ringed planet Saturn, and below it will be Fomalhaut, the brightest star in the constellation Piscis Austrinus, the Southern Fish, and just 25 light-years distant. At magnitude +1, it's one of the brightest stars in the night sky. It's also one of the four Royal Stars of the Persian culture, and called the Watcher of the South. The other stars are Aldebaran (Watcher of the East), Regulus (Watcher of the North) and Antares (Watcher of the West). All are regarded as guardians of the sky. — Jamie Carter Look west again after sunset today to have an easier, albeit slightly wider, view of the now 18%-illuminated crescent moon and Earth's closest planetary neighbor, Venus. Tonight, we also see the peak of the Southern Taurid meteor shower. Though its five shooting stars per hour may seem like nothing to get excited about, Taurids tend to be bright fireballs, so it's a great night to go stargazing. — Jamie Carter Venus is well into its apparition as the 'Evening Star' in 2024, but if you want the best view of the brightest planet, catch it when a crescent moon slides past it. That happens tonight, with the sight of an 11%-illuminated crescent moon and the second planet above the western horizon. The two will be about three degrees apart, less than the width of your three middle fingers held at arm's length against the night sky. Venus will be above the moon. — Jamie Carter Here's another small constellation taking shelter within the Summer Triangle. After finding Altair at the bottom of that vast asterism of stars, travel to its top right to find a small shape of four stars in the shape of an arrow. It's best seen by identifying its two close stars and then taking a 90-degree turn to see its other two stars. Together, they slice off a corner of the Summer Triangle. — Jamie Carter You'll need a very dark sky for this, but with a new moon yesterday, it's the perfect opportunity to see one of the farthest objects possible to see with the naked eye. A whopping 2.5 million light-years distant, the Andromeda Galaxy — also known as M31 — is visible to keen eyes in the northeastern evening night sky in the northern hemisphere. It's between Cassiopeia and the Great Square of Pegasus, with the right-hand \"V\" in Cassiopeia's \"W\" shape acting as an arrowhead straight to it. M31 is the most remarkable galaxy for those stargazing from the northern hemisphere and can be easily found as a fuzzy patch in binoculars, even under urban skies. At about half a trillion stars, it's larger than the Milky Way and will collide with it in a few billion years. — Jamie Carter Early today sees the end of Daylight Savings Time in North America, where clocks will \"fall back\" this fall (as opposed to \"springing forward\" in spring) at 02:00 a.m. local time across the continent. However, you won't need to know the time for today's main sky sight, which will see a 6%-lit crescent moon tangle with Antares and Mercury in the western sky after sunset. The action will happen immediately after sunset and sink soon after, so grab a glimpse. Venus will be shining brightly above the melee to act as your guide. — Jamie Carter With many outside trick-or-treating, Halloween is the perfect time for stargazing and sharing the night sky. Venus will shine in the southwest at dusk, while dimmer Saturn rides high in the southeast. The Summer Triangle will be visible high above the southwest, while the stars of the Big Dipper will shine low above the northern horizon. About two hours after sunset, Jupiter will rise in the east. — Jamie Carter The night before Halloween, Devil's Night, provides an excellent excuse to look for a star known as the \"Demon Star.\" Algol in the constellation Perseus is the ultimate example of what astronomers call a variable star, dipping from +2.1 to +3.4 magnitude for about 10 hours every 69 hours. That happens because it's three stars that regularly eclipse each other. Its name comes from the Arabic \"Al Ra's al Ghul,\" which translates to \"the head of the demon,\" according to Britannica. Algol is easily visible to the naked eye as soon as it darkens. You'll find it halfway between Cassiopeia and the Pleiades star open cluster in the northeast night sky. Tonight, it's also above Jupiter. — Jamie Carter If you're an avid stargazer then you'll be excited to see the return to the early evening night sky this month of the closest and most spectacular open cluster of stars. The Pleiades, also called the \"Seven Sisters,\" are six or seven bright stars (depending on how good your eyesight is) arranged in a mini-Big Dipper shape. It's in the constellation of Taurus — above the \"V\" of Taurus — and heralds the rise of some of the brightest stars in the night sky, such as Orion's Belt, Betelgeuse and Sirius. The Pleiades will rise tonight in the east as the sun sets. Becoming visible just above east-southeast as it gets dark. Look straight at the Pleiades and see its six or seven stars. However, looking slightly to its side is a better way to appreciate the Pleiades. Try it! Instead of points of light, you'll see what seems like a very bright patch. This technique, called averted vision, is also handy for looking at galaxies through a telescope. It works because while direct vision is necessary for detail, peripheral vision is sensitive to brightness. — Jamie Carter You'll probably know how to find the famous Summer Triangle in the sky. Just look high above the southwest to see its three bright stars — Deneb (top), Vega (middle) and Altair (bottom). However, close to Altair is a small constellation worth searching out. Just above Altair and to the left, you'll find Delphinus, the dolphin (or is it a tadpole?) that's most easily found by locating its four brightest stars in a diamond shape, which is known to stargazers as \"Job's Coffin.\" — Jamie Carter It's been a few weeks since the crescent moon tangled first with Venus, then Antares. Since then, the planet has inched closer toward the massive star, and tonight, they'll be in conjunction — very close to each other. Look to the southwest after dark to see Venus positioned slightly higher than Antares, separated by about three degrees. — Jamie Carter Now waning towards the new moon — and an inevitable eclipse of the sun — our natural satellite will tonight be 30%-lit as it sails through the constellation Leo. Look to the southeast before dawn; you'll see it just three above Regulus, Leo's brightest star and one of the brightest in the night sky. It's about 78 light-years from the solar system. — Jamie Carter Look to the northeast after dark, and you'll quickly see the constellation Cassiopeia high in the sky. What's that bright yellow-orange star below it? The brightest star of the constellation Auriga, the charioteer, and the sixth brightest in the night sky, Capella, will be with us for many months. Just 43 light-years from the solar system, it's two giant binary stars — each about 10 times larger than the sun — and two fainter, distant, red dwarf stars. Capella is the \"Goat Star\" because it was once used as a guiding light for shepherds. Look just above-right of Capella and, in a dark sky, you'll see an elongated triangle of stars, with one close to Capella and two tighter stars more distant. They're called \"The Kids,\" meant to be Capella's offspring. — Jamie Carter Today's last or third quarter moon sees our satellite half-lit as seen from Earth as it transitions from being a waning gibbous moon to a waning crescent moon. Rising around midnight and setting around noon tomorrow, it's an important waymarker for sky-watchers because it signals the opening of a window of dark, moonless evenings that will last for the next ten nights or so. — Jamie Carter Though mostly the same sight as last night, tonight — again, just before midnight — you'll be able to watch a now 51%-lit waning gibbous moon rising in the east-northeast alongside Mars and below the stars of the constellation Gemini. Once again, Capella, Jupiter and the stars of Orion will shine brightly above. — Jamie Carter Be outside looking to the east-northeast just before midnight local time, and you'll see a gaggle of bright celestial objects appear individually. Bright Jupiter will be an easy spot, with Capella to its upper left. Rising below will be a very bright, 70%-lit waning gibbous moon, which will appear to the right of the two bright stars in Gemini, Castor and Pollux and farther to the left of the unmistakable stars of Orion's Belt. Either side of its three belt stars — Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka — will be ruddy Betelgeuse and blue Rigel. Wait for the moon to rise a few degrees above the horizon, and Mars will appear below it. — Jamie Carter Is comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) still visible to the naked eye? By now, it may not be, but it's still worth looking for the icy visitor from the solar system's edge. As it creeps higher into the night sky, tonight it enters the constellation Ophiuchus, the thirteenth yet roundly ignored zodiacal constellation (zodiacal meaning the sun passes through it). It will now be visible above the southwest horizon as soon as it darkens. It's a long shot, but if you're in a dark sky destination away from light pollution, the Milky Way may be visible in the southwest, providing a backdrop to the comet. — Jamie Carter If you're a novice stargazer, locating Cassiopeia will give you a greater understanding of navigating the night sky. As a bonus, it's easy to find this time of year. Look to the northeast for a slightly misshapen W-shape of five bright stars. If you can't find it, look to the northeast for the Big Dipper, which is always roughly opposite. That's because the stars in the north appear to rotate around Polaris, the North Star, which you'll find between them in a dark patch of sky. While the Big Dipper is easily found all spring and summer (\"spring up, fall down\"), the opposite is the case for Cassiopeia, which will be easy to see all fall and winter, albeit mainly as an inverted W. — Jamie Carter Another \"supermoon\"?! Yes — and not only that but the biggest and brightest of the year. Why? October's full moon will be the closest to Earth, that's all. With the moon taking a slightly elliptical journey around Earth each month, it's sure to happen every year. Be outside looking east at moonrise where you are — during dusk — to see it appear on the horizon draped in orange hues. October's full moon is considered the \"Hunter's Moon\" by early Native American tribes who used its all-night light to hunt for game. — Jamie Carter Despite the moon shining brightly tonight, it's a good time to look east from about two hours before midnight dark for the stars of the constellation Taurus, \"the bull,\" not least because there's currently an extra \"star.\" First, look for Aldebaran, the \"eye of the bull,\" and the brightest star in Taurus. Now, find the faint \"V\" of Taurus. That's the Hyades star clusters, one of the closest to the solar system. Above will be the fuzzy Pleiades, and to the lower left will be bright Jupiter. — Jamie Carter Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) is climbing higher into the night sky, though likely getting dimmer as it does. It's now between Venus and Arcturus but still relatively close to the sun, so be looking west as soon as the sun sets. A pair of binoculars or a telescope may be decisive. — Jamie Carter Fresh from its bright opposition in September, Saturn remains an excellent target for naked eye stargazers. As luck would have it, tonight it will rise with the almost full moon, appearing just after sunset in North America. Once the moon has risen into a darker sky and lost its golden yellow look, you'll see Saturn trailing behind it by just the width of your pinky finger at arm's length. From parts of South and East Africa, India, China and Southeast Asia, the moon will appear to occult Saturn, according to In-The-Sky.org. — Jamie Carter Look again to the western sky after dark to have another slight chance of seeing Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) and its tail, either with your naked eyes or using a pair of binoculars or a telescope to give you a better chance. Today, we also see the opening of the launch window for NASA's EscaPADE mission to Mars, which will launch on the debut flight of Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket. — Jamie Carter After dark on Oct. 11, look for the Summer Triangle high in the sky above the moon. (Image credit: Starry Night/Jamie Carter) The most famous shape from July through fall is the Summer Triangle, a vast asterism with three bright stars — Vega, Deneb and Altair — making its corners. It's on the wane by now, but it's still prominent. After dark tonight, it will be visible high above the southwest, appearing to point like an arrowhead at the now 63%-lit waxing gibbous moon in the south. — Jamie Carter The name of today's phase of the moon is rather misleading. At first quarter, the moon appears half-lit — as it always is — with only one side illuminated as seen from Earth. Earth's perspective is everything when it comes to the moon. It's tidally locked to Earth, so it always shows the same face and rotates only once with respect to the sun in each orbit. Where you are on Earth with respect to the equator affects what a first-quarter moon looks like; from the northern hemisphere, the moon's right-hand side is lit, while from the southern hemisphere, it's the left-hand side. Either way, the first quarter moon is when the night skies begin to get brightly lit by moonlight in the early evenings, making stargazing trickier. — Jamie Carter Oct. 7's Draconid meteor shower will appear to travel from the northern sky, close to the Big Dipper. (Image credit: Haitong Yu via Getty Images) Hope for clear skies to the north today. If you're in the northern hemisphere, arguably the year's most convenient meteor shower, the Draconids, will peak. Rates of \"shooting stars\" tend to peak when the course constellation is highest in the sky, typically after midnight. However, since Draco is circumpolar (appearing to rotate around Polaris, the North Star), it's always visible, so you may see some as soon as it gets dark. As twilight fades, don't forget to look to the southwest, where a now 23%-lit waxing crescent moon will shine just a couple of degrees from Antares in Scorpius. — Jamie Carter Here's a famous star-hop that will work well this month but be nearly impossible by November. Face north-northwest when it gets completely dark, and you'll see the familiar shape of the Big Dipper, its seven stars shaped like a bowl (on the right) and a handle(on the left). Follow the curve of its handle and keep going, and you'll reach Arcturus, which is low above the western horizon. About two hours after sunset, Arcturus will set, and the Big Dipper will be dead on the northern horizon. — Jamie Carter A delicate crescent moon beside Venus is one of the sky's most beautiful sights and one of October's sky-watching highlights. It's on offer to anyone who looks southwest in a clear sky immediately after sunset tonight, where a delicate 9%-lit waxing crescent moon will shine very low on the horizon just below and left of the planet. They'll be about four degrees apart, the span of your three middle fingers at arm's length. Venus will likely be easier to see. — Jamie Carter Although the moon has moved another 27th of its journey around Earth, it's still a slim crescent and remains very close to Venus. Tonight, the 15%-lit waxing crescent will shine to the left of Venus and will likely be easier to see than last night. You'll also see \"Earthshine\" on the moon's dark limb — sunlight reflected from Earth's oceans and ice caps. — Jamie Carter The Milky Way is always visible in the night sky, but it's only prominent between April and October in the Northern Hemisphere. This week is a good time to get a last look at the bright star fields of Sagittarius and Scorpius. You must be in a dark sky destination, such as a Dark Sky Place or anywhere that looks dark on a light pollution map. Look south as soon as it gets completely dark. You'll see the Milky Way's center, its brightest section, close to the horizon, with a stream of stars thinning out as it arcs high above your head through Cassiopeia, a constellation of five stars shaped like the letter W. You just saw the Perseus Arm of the Milky Way. — Jamie Carter Did you see the total solar eclipse on April 8? Here's the follow-up. There are at least two solar eclipses yearly, but not all are total. What happens today is an annular solar eclipse, where the new moon passes directly in front of the sun but doesn't cover it completely. Since the moon will be farther from Earth than on April 8, its disk will be too small to completely cover the sun, creating instead a \"ring of fire.\" To see the ring today, you'll need to be within a narrow 165 miles (267 kilometers) wide path stretching 8,800 miles (14,163 kilometers) across the Pacific Ocean, South America (the Patagonia region of southern Chile and Argentina) and the South Atlantic Ocean. It's a sparsely populated area, home to just 175,000 people. Most eclipse chasers are headed to Easter Island (Rapa Nui, a remote island 2,200 miles (3,540 km) west of Chile. Much of South America will see a partial solar eclipse. Everyone, whether in the path or not, will need to wear solar eclipse glasses or use solar filters on telescopes and binoculars to observe the event safely. — Jamie Carter Editor's note: You can keep up with all the solar eclipse action with our solar eclipse live blog. We will also be streaming the eclipse live on Space.com. Here's one last chance for those in the northern hemisphere to try for a naked-eye view of Comet C/2023 A3 Tsuchinshan Atlas before it's only visible to those in equatorial regions for a few mornings. If you're having trouble finding it in the horizon haze, consider using a pair of binoculars or a telescope to give you a better chance. If you want a souvenir shot, see how to photograph comets, the best cameras for astrophotography and the best lenses for astrophotography. — Jamie Carter If you're up for an early start to the weekend, this morning presents another great chance to try for a naked-eye view of Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS). That said, given the fickle of comets, it may be wise to have a pair of the best binoculars or one of the best telescopes to give yourself the best chance. Also, check out how to photograph comets, our best cameras for astrophotography and the best lenses for astrophotography. — Jamie Carter Here's a chance for sky-watchers in the northern hemisphere to glimpse Comet C/2023 A3 Tsuchinshan-ATLAS before it disappears for a few weeks. Now, three days after its perihelion — its closest point to the sun — it may be getting less bright and tougher to see before sunrise as it retreats into the sun's glare. Look east-southeast an hour before sunrise. — Jamie Carter Early Friday morning, we could see the first opportunity for sky-watchers in the northern hemisphere to glimpse Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS). It arrives today at perihelion — its closest point to the sun — as it gets to within 36 million miles (58 million km) of our star. That means it should reach peak brightness. Comets are fickle and hard to predict, but it's possible it could be visible to the naked eye. To see if that prediction comes true, be outside looking east-southeast an hour before sunrise. — Jamie Carter Few people realize that the stars rise four minutes earlier each night, returning to where they are precisely 23 hours and 56 minutes later. This is what astronomers call a sidereal day, and over a month, it means stars rise two hours earlier. Today that means you can effectively go stargazing at 4:00 a.m. on Sept. 25, look east, and see the same sky as you would see at 10:00 p.m. in December. You'll see some of the brightest stars in the night sky in the famous winter constellations: Rigel and Betelgeuse in Orion (as well as Orion's belt rising on its side), Aldebaran in Taurus, Capella in Auriga, Pollux and Castor in Gemini, Procyon in Canis Minor and Sirius in Canis Major. With Betelgeuse at the center, you can trace-put the stars to make a vast shape known variously as the Great Hexagon, also known as the Winter Hexagon and Winter Circle. As a bonus, you'll find Jupiter above Betelgeuse and Mars to its left, about four degrees (the span of your three middle fingers at arm's length) from a waning crescent moon.— Jamie Carter Related: How to see the 'Great Hexagon' of bright winter stars Pollux is the brightest star in the constellation Gemini and one of the most colorful in Earth's sky. It's also one of the closest bright stars at just 34 light years. This morning it will shine just 1.6 degrees from the waning gibbous moon (about the width of your pinky finger at arm's length), about a third of which will be illuminated tonight. — Jamie Carter The moon will rise half-lit in the east at midnight tonight, as seen from Earth. That's because it reaches the Last Quarter (also called the Third Quarter), which marks the completion of three-quarters of its monthly journey around the sun. That moment officially comes at 2:50 p.m. EDT when the moon is below the horizon for those in North America. Its left-hand half will be illuminated, as observed from the northern hemisphere. It will set in the west around midday on Wednesday, Sept. 25. — Jamie Carter With the moon rising late at night, there's one last window of moonless dark skies to see the Milky Way while it's still prominent. Now sinking into the southwestern horizon, it's still an incredible sight if you can escape light pollution. You should get a fantastic view any night for the rest of this month. Come October, however, it will be lost in the horizon haze, not returning to view until April. — Jamie Carter September is the perfect month to look for Fomalhaut, the \"autumn star,\" from mid-northern latitudes. It's the 18th brightest star in the night sky, but one generally associated with the southern hemisphere. Those observing from about 40 degrees north and below can see it this month just above due south, below Saturn. It's in the constellation Piscis Austrinus, the southern fish, just 25 light-years away from the solar system. — Jamie Carter Related: Fomalhaut: 'Eye of Sauron' With A 'Zombie Planet' After it gets dark tonight — and any night this month — look to the east, and you'll quickly find four stars that appear to make a square (albeit on its side, so looking more like a diamond). It will be just to the right of the W-shaped constellation Cassiopeia. The corner four stars — Scheat, Alpheratz, Markab and Algenib — make up the Great Square in the constellation of Pegasus. It's likely more prominent than you might expect, and it's hard to ignore after you've found it. Its rise in the east signals the coming of autumn, which begins tomorrow. — Jamie Carter It's not something you can see, but today at 7:44 a.m. EDT is equinox, meaning equal night in Latin. It means roughly 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night worldwide (although that technically occurs on Sept. 26 for 40 degrees latitude). It's a landmark moment of the year for stargazers and amateur astronomers in the northern hemisphere because there will finally be more darkness than daylight. However, today's real attraction is the close pass of the 75%-illuminated waning gibbous moon and the Pleiades. There will be just 0.2 degrees between the two at 5:17 a.m. EDT. Uranus will be just below but too dim to see with the naked eye. — Jamie Carter Read more: See the moon meet up with the Seven Sisters of the Pleiades this weekend The Southern Cross is a fabulous sight for those in the Southern Hemisphere, but did you know there's also a Northern Cross? It's more commonly known as the constellation Cygnus, the swan, though it looks much more like a cross than a bird to most eyes. Face southeast tonight anytime after dark, and you should be able to pick out Deneb, a bright star and one of the corners of the famous Summer Triangle asterism. Return to Debeb, and you'll see three stars close to it within the Summer Triangle and another single star in the middle of the Summer Triangle, called Albireo. Put them together, and you have the head of a swan (Albireo) with the wings behind or, more obviously, a simple cross. — Jamie Carter The Earth partially eclipsing the second-largest supermoon of the year may seem like a terrific double-header not to miss, but it's set to be a slightly underwhelming event. Although the moon turns full at 10:34 p.m. EDT, that's not when to look. Instead, look east at moonrise to make the best of the moon illusion, the human brain's strong tendency for the moon to appear larger than it is when it's just coming over the horizon. This phenomenon will explain why the rising \"Harvest Moon\" will look full rather than because it's a supermoon, which, although it places it closer to Earth than on average, will make no discernable difference to its visible size. For the proof, go look at the full moon once it's risen higher —it won't look any different from any other. As a bonus, on the other side of the sky at moonrise, bright Venus will shine close to Spica. Later in the evening, a partial lunar eclipse will occur. It will see only a small slither of the moon's edge (just 8.4%) recede into Earth's central shadow, with the best time to view it 10:12-11:15 p.m. EDT (3:12-4:15 a.m. GMT on Wednesday, Sept. 18). However, it's also fun to watch the Earth's fuzzier penumbral shadow travel across the moon. You can get a full schedule for your location on Timeanddate. Wherever you watch the full \"supermoon\" rise from today, watch for Saturn to its upper-right. — Jamie Carter Read more: Don't miss the Harvest Moon Supermoon lunar eclipse tonight! Here's what to expect Editor's note: If you are unable to watch the lunar eclipse in person you can watch all the action unfold online here on Space.com. We have rounded up several lunar eclipse livestreams that are showing the Super Harvest Moon on Sept. 17. Although it was yesterday that the \"supermoon\" was celebrated, it's early this morning that the moon reaches perigee — its closest point to Earth on its slightly elliptical monthly orbital path. It reached that point at 8:26 a.m. EDT today. So, if you catch it close to moonset where you are, you'll see the true \"supermoon.\" However, it won't be quite full — see its slightly ragged lower-right edge (as seen from the northern hemisphere). Come back at moonrise later today and you'll see an almost full moon with a slightly more ragged top-right edge. — Jamie Carter Summer is almost over. How do we know? The Summer Triangle of stars — Deneb, Vega and Altair — and beginning to sink in the west as it gets dark. After riding high all summer, the famous asterism is now looking lop-sided as the night wears on. However, it's got some staying power yet, with tonight offering the chance to make the triangle into a diamond. Face south, and you'll see Altair at the bottom of the triangle, at its tip, with Deneb high up above the east and Vega towards the west. Now make a triangle on the other side of Altair and Vega, with a reasonably bright star called Rasalhague. It's the brightest star in Ophiuchus, a large yet little-known constellation, one of the 13th zodiacal constellations. With Deneb opposite, Rasalhague makes a Summer Diamond shape. — Jamie Carter Last month, sky-watchers in Europe saw Saturn occulted — covered up or eclipsed — by the moon. This month, it's the turn of those in North America to watch the ringed planet dramatically disappear for about 45 minutes behind an almost full moon. This lunar occultation of Saturn will take place between 4:08 a.m. and 8:07 a.m. EDT and will be visible along the western United States, Australia, western Canada and north-western Mexico, to name but a few. To see if the occultation is visible from your location, check out IntheSky.org.— Jamie Carter Related: Astrophotographer captures Saturn vanishing behind the moon in mesmerizing photo. If you've yet to see Venus this year, tonight is an excellent opportunity. The second planet from the sun has been conspicuous by its absence from the evening night sky since 2023 but is now beginning to shine more brightly after sunset just above the west-southwest horizon. After the sun and moon, it's the brightest object in the night sky, shining at magnitude -3.9 tonight. As a bonus, you'll find another bright object nearby, just a couple of degrees (the span of your two smallest fingers at arm's length) to the left. That's Spica, the brightest star in the constellation of Virgo and the 16th brightest star in the night sky. This bluish-white helium star is about 262 light-years distant and hugely luminous (it's about 2,300 times more luminous than the sun). Try to catch Venus as the \"Evening Star\" and Virgo's brightest star quickly after sunset because they will sink soon after. The sight of Spica is associated with summer in the northern hemisphere, so its disappearance soon after sunset signals that the summer season is about to end, with autumn officially arriving in the northern hemisphere on Sept. 22. — Jamie Carter The week before the full moon is perfect for seeing the moon in the afternoon. It rises in the southeast (as seen from the northern hemisphere) in mid-afternoon. Since it's already reached its first quarter phase, it's now a waxing gibbous moon, which means over half of its visible face is illuminated, and it's waxing towards full. Since the moon is 400,000 times less bright than the sun, it won't be immediately apparent in a blue sky, but keep looking, and you'll quickly see it with your naked eyes. As the day progresses into the evening, it will rise higher and become more prominent and then dominate the southern sky as twilight takes hold. The moon takes 29.5 days to orbit Earth, roughly dividing its journey into four phases. Tonight sees it reach first quarter, which marks the halfway point between a new and full moon. Rising around midday and setting around midnight, the moon will be precisely 50% illuminated — as seen from Earth — at 2:06 a.m. EDT (0606 GMT). That's because it's at a 90-degree angle from the sun, so only its eastern side will receive sunlight. It's an excellent naked-eye target for twilight that puts the eastern side of the moon on display.— Jamie Carter Related: What is the moon phase today? Lunar phases 2024 During evening twilight, a half-moon will shine brightly in the south. Look to its right, and you'll see the red supergiant star Antares, the brightest in the constellation Scorpius, one of the 13 zodiac constellations. It's prominent at this time of year from both hemispheres. Look carefully, and you'll notice the reddish-orange color of Antares, a symptom of its relatively low temperature. Around 604 light-years from Earth, Antares is 700 times the sun's diameter. If it were in the solar system, it would engulf Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Its name means \"anti-Ares\" or \"rival of Mars\" because the red planet passes close to it every 26 months. Scorpius is a region of the sky rich in star fields and deep sky objects (such as the Butterfly Cluster (NGC 6405 and Messier 6), Ptolemy's Cluster (NGC 6475 or M7) and M4) because it's near the center of the Milky Way. — Jamie Carter Read more: Night sky, September 2024: What you can see tonight [maps] Look due west again tonight just after sunset, and with a clear view low to the west-southwest horizon, you'll see a crescent moon a little higher in the sky. This time, Venus will be farther to the lower right of the crescent moon, close to the horizon. Now around 13% illuminated, it should be possible to see a trace of light on the moon's dark side, opposite the crescent. That's sunlight reflected from Earth onto the moon; it's called \"Da Vinci glow,\" \"planet-shine,\" or \"Earthshine.\" Look carefully, and you'll see a star to the moon's right. That's Spica in Virgo, one of the brightest stars that the moon appears to frequently pass on its monthly journey around Earth. — Jamie Carter Look west just after sunset for a remarkable sight denied to stargazers since last year. The two brightest objects in the sky aside from the sun — the moon and Venus — will tonight shine about six degrees (the span of your three middle fingers held at arm's length) from each other for a short time after sunset. You'll need a good view low to the western horizon (try a tall building or observe from a west-facing beach). The crescent moon will be very delicate and may require binoculars. Venus is known as the \"Evening Star\" in its current apparition because it's visible after sunset. — Jamie Carter Related: Night sky, September 2024: What you can see tonight [maps] As the sun sets on Wednesday, Sept. 4 the waxing crescent moon will be just above the western horizon near a bright Venus. A very thin crescent moon will be located just several finger-widths to Venus' lower right (to its celestial west) — close enough that both can be seen by binoculars (orange circle in the image above). Skywatchers viewing the pair from southerly latitudes will be able to see the moon more easily, as the pair will be close to the horizon at sunset for everyone else. Mercury, the closest planet to the sun, is rarely seen. Since it orbits so close to our star, it's typically lost in its glare and impossible to see. That changes occasionally when its position in the solar system relative to Earth puts it temporarily high above the horizon on a few successive days. It can only ever be visible from Earth just before sunrise or just after sunset. The former is the case tonight, with Mercury's so-called \"greatest western elongation\" from the sun (at 18 degrees) placing it just above the eastern horizon about half an hour before sunrise this morning. You'll need a good view low to the eastern horizon, but at magnitude +0.4 the tiny planet is relatively dim — don't expect much more than a red dot. It's worth returning at the same time on Saturday, Sept. 8, when Mercury appears a little higher in the sky. — Jamie Carter There is no guarantee of northern lights tonight, or any night this month, but something about September makes them more likely and, in theory, more intense. Given that the nights are drawing in in the northern hemisphere, and the moon sets early all this week, it may be a good week to see them at lower latitudes than is typical. The reason is what's known as the Russell-McPherron Effect. It's a hypothesis from a paper published in 1973 that the tilt of the Earth's axis at the time of equinox (which occurs on Sept. 22) puts it side-on to the sun, meaning Earth's magnetic field is aligned to the solar wind. This means a greater chance of more intense geomagnetic storms, which cause aurora displays. You'll need to consult the NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center to see if there's a favorable prediction tonight (a G4 or a G5 geomagnetic storm is what you want if you live in mid-northern latitudes), but aurora hunters often claim that the equinoxes are the best times for beautiful displays. Pay special attention to NOAA's 3-day Forecast and the prediction for the aurora view line for tonight and tomorrow. — Jamie Carter Related: Aurora season is here: What to expect from the northern lights in 2024/25 It won't be a spectacular display, but expect about six \"shooting stars\" per hour as the Aurigid meteor shower peaks tonight. It's named after the Auriga constellation, which will rise in the northeast around midnight and highest just before dawn breaks. It's not worth staying up for per se, but if you're out stargazing in the early hours today, keep an eye out for fast-moving meteors. The Aurigids are active each year from Aug. 28 through Sept. 4.— Jamie Carter Mercury orbits the sun every 88 days, closer to the sun than Earth, so we see it briefly emerge from the sun's glare only now and again. Today, it will be just below and right from a very slim crescent moon about an hour before sunrise in the pre-dawn sky. It won't be easy to see with the naked eye, but the moon will help you find it. Look out for mesmerizing Earthshine (sunlight is reflected off Earth) on the moon's dark side. — Jamie Carter On Monday, Sept. 2, at 9:55 p.m. EDT, the moon will officially reach its new moon phase. It’s impossible to see because it’s roughly between the Earth and the sun, so lost in the latter’s glare (unless there's a solar eclipse, which is precisely what will happen next month when an annular solar eclipse will be seen from the southern hemisphere). That makes it the perfect night to see faint objects in the night sky. If you can get far away from light pollution, September is a great time to see the “false dawn” or zodiacal light, which becomes visible about an hour before sunrise in the eastern sky. It is sunlight scattered off dust in the solar system and is brightest close to the autumnal equinox, which will occur later this month. — Jamie Carter Related: Wonder at the 'false dawn' of zodiacal light in early autumn Look to the east for a view on the morning of Aug. 30, of a slim, waning crescent moon in the subtle light of dawn. Just a tenth of its surface will be sun-lit as it glides below two stars, Castor and Pollux, in the constellation Gemini. The top star, Castor, is 51 light-years distant, while the yellowish Pollux, between it and the moon, is 34 light-years away. These \"twins\" of Gemini are best known as winter evening stars. Look to the right, and you'll see other winter stars, including the three famous stars of Orion's Belt — Mintaka, Alnilam and Alnitak — and ruddy Betelgeuse. This red supergiant will one day go supernova. — Jamie Carter From late August to early September mornings, six planets — Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune and Saturn — will be visible across the morning sky. Looking East. South and West, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn will be relatively easy to spot the other three will be a bit more of a challenge. You'll need a small telescope or binoculars to see the dimmer planets Uranus and Neptune and Mercury will only appear about 30 minutes or so before sunrise. You can use a program like Stellarium to discover what is visible in the night sky from your viewing location at a particular time. The summer nights are perfect for observing the strange star Algol (or Beta Persei) in the constellation Perseus. It is one of the most easy-to-monitor variable stars. During a ten-hour period that repeats every 2 days, 20 hours, and 49 minutes, Algol dims noticeably and then re-brightens when a companion star with an orbit nearly edge-on to Earth crosses behind the much brighter main star, reducing the total light output we perceive. Algol normally shines at magnitude 2.1, similar to the nearby star Almach in Andromeda. But while dimmed to minimum brightness, Algol's magnitude of 3.4 is almost the same as the star Rho Persei (ρ Per), which shines just two finger widths to Algol's lower right (or 2.25 degrees to the celestial south). — Chris Vaughan A third (or last) quarter moon looks half-lit and appears around midnight. The sight of it rising in the east late at night can be dramatic. This moon phase is much-loved by naked-eye stargazers precisely because it rises so late, leaving the early evening night sky dark enough to see faint constellations and deep sky targets. A third-quarter moon always sets in the western daytime sky in the early afternoon. Over the next week, it will shrink to a crescent moon, which will be best seen in the east in the pre-dawn hours towards the end of this week. — Jamie Carter From the wee hours until dawn on Tuesday morning, Aug. 27, the pretty, waning crescent moon will shine above the planets Jupiter and Mars in the eastern sky, setting up a nice widefield photo opportunity. (Image credit: Chris Vaughan/Starry Night) In the very early hours of this morning, a plump crescent moon will rise in the east above a couple of planets. Directly below will be Jupiter, shining at a magnitude -2.2, followed by Mars at +2. To the right of Jupiter will be Aldebaran, the brightest star in the Taurus constellation, while above all of that will be the sparkling Pleiades open cluster of stars. Look at the same time on Wednesday, Aug. 28, and you'll see a slimmer crescent moon alongside Mars. — Jamie Carter On late August evenings, four small constellations sit high in the southeastern sky below the very bright star Vega. The easiest one to see is Delphinus, the Dolphin, which is composed of four medium-bright stars forming a small elongated diamond connected to a star extending to the lower right (or celestial southwest). Equuleus, the Little Horse is positioned about a fist's diameter below Delphinus. Diminutive Equuleus is the second to last constellation by size, after Crux, the Southern Cross. Sitting a generous fist's width above Delphinus is the next smallest constellation by area, Sagitta, the Arrow. And sweeping a palm's width higher will bring you to the stars of Vulpecula, the Fox. Except for the slightly larger fox, each of these small constellations will fit within the field of view of binoculars. The Milky Way passes through Sagitta and Vulpecula, populating them with a variety of deep sky objects. The sky between those two constellations hosts a dark dust lane. -- Chris Vaughan It's not every day you can gaze at the moon and spot a landmark from one of the most iconic sci-fi films. The Harpalus crater served as the rocket landing site in the 1950s movie \"Destination Moon.\" Due to its close proximity to the lunar north pole, the Harpalus crater is significantly foreshortened when viewed from Earth, often appearing more oval than circular. But the moon's axial wobble, known as libration, occasionally but regularly tilts features close to the edge toward us and then away, letting us get a peek 'around the edge' of the moon. This month, Harpalus will be well placed for observation as the crater will be tipped slightly toward us. When viewed through a small telescope you'll be able to make out the details on the walls and floor of the 25-mile (40 kilometers) wide crater and even another small crater within it. The crater remains fully illuminated until Aug. 27, when the terminator (the division between the illuminated and dark hemispheres) will return and plunge the crater back into darkness, by Sept. 5 the crater will be out of view. -- Daisy Dobrijevic Saturn will reach its annual opposition in just a few weeks when it will be at its biggest and brightest in Earth's sky of the entire year. Tonight there's a preview, when it appears next to an almost full moon. Rising in the east after sunset at about 9:30 p.m. local time, the two will shine together all night. However, it's always impossible to glimpse Saturn's famous ring pattern with the naked eye. You'll need a small telescope for that. If you rise early in the morning on Aug. 21, wherever you are, you'll see the pretty sight of the moon and Saturn setting together in the southwestern sky before sunrise. However, if you're in parts of Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa and Europe, the moon will pass in front of Saturn, blocking it from view for a short period. Countries with a good view include Brazil, Portugal, Spain, France and the U.K., according to In-The-Sky.org. From the U.K., this lunar occultation will take place from 4:25 to 5:23 a.m. GMT on Aug. 21. — Jamie Carter The moon is the easiest target for the naked eye, but when you look at it does make a big difference. Although August's full moon will become officially 100%-lit at 2:26 p.m. EDT, 11:26 a.m. PDT and 18:26 GMT, the time to look at it will be moonrise. It's much easier to look at the moon as it appears on the eastern horizon, draped in subtle orangey light, compared to just 20 minutes later, when it will have risen higher into the sky and become a lot brighter and whiter. The full moon is always at its most impactful when viewed on the horizon, thanks to the moon illusion. Today's full moon will be slightly bigger than usual because it will be slightly closer to Earth on its elliptical orbital path — hence the name 'supermoon' — though that will be virtually impossible to detect. It will also be a 'Blue Moon' thanks to a calendar quirk; it will be the third of four full moons in the astronomical season of summer. However, at no point will the moon look blue. — Jamie Carter You can watch the Supermoon Blue Moon rise today in a free livestream starting at 3:30 p.m. EDT (1930 GMT), weather permitting. As the moon waxes towards being full next week, it rises earlier and will be easy to see shining brightly after dark, but it's visible many hours before sunset. Today, the moon will rise about 90% and be illuminated in the southeast at about 6:30 p.m. local time. The late-afternoon moon occurs because the moon is orbiting the Earth from west to east, traveling 13 degrees every 24 hours, thus rising around 50 minutes earlier each day. It will be a beautiful sight in a blue sky for a short time and dominate the post-sunset twilight sky. — Jamie Carter Just after midnight local time, Jupiter and Mars will come up over the east-northeast horizon and will be well-placed for viewing an hour or two later. Jupiter will shine at magnitude -2.2 and Mars +0.8, but despite their large difference in brightness, the pair will make for an interesting skywatching sight. The pair will appear very cozy in the night sky, appearing just 20 or so arc minutes apart, meaning you'll be able to fit both planets in the view of a telescope, with low-to-moderate magnification. Bright stars in the summer night sky are a great skywatching target for those in the Northern Hemisphere. If you look at them long enough you should notice that they shine different colors. The color of a star is controlled by the temperature of its photosphere — the outer 'shell' which radiates light. The colors change blue to white to yellow to orange, as temperature decreases, with the coolest stars appearing red. The three prominent stars of the Summer Triangle asterism in the eastern sky —Deneb, Vega, and Altair — are A-class stars that appear blue-white to the naked eye, with temperatures ranging from 7,500 to 10,000 Kelvin. In contrast, Arcturus, visible in the western evening sky, is an orange K-class giant star with a temperature of around 4,300 K. Meanwhile, the reddish Antares, the heart of the Scorpius constellation, is an older M-class star with a cooler surface temperature of 3,500 K. After midnight local time, look for the very bright, yellowish Capella rising in the northeast. You can estimate the temperatures of dimmer stars by comparing their color to these bright reference stars. Look to the south immediately after sunset, and you'll see a waxing gibbous moon, now more than half-lit, shining brightly. Look to its upper left, and you may spy Antares, a reddish star now at its best. It's the brightest star in the iconic constellation of Scorpius and about 555 light-years from the solar system. Squint at it, and you'll more easily notice its reddish hue. The later you look, the closer the moon and Antares will be. From the South Pacific, the moon will occult (block) Antares, according to In-The-Sky.org. — Jamie Carter It will be worth getting up early for this, one of the closest conjunctions between planets this year. Visible in the southeast from about 2 a.m. local time until sunrise, Mars and Jupiter will get to just a third of a degree apart (a third of the width of your little finger held at arm's length). However, Jupiter, at magnitude -2.2, will be about 15 times brighter than Mars at magnitude +0.8. Although the two planets will appear at their closest this morning, it will be worth looking at the pair during the mornings before and after for a similar view. — Jamie Carter Early this morning, the peak of the annual Perseid meteor shower took place, but don't despair if you missed it because of work or bad weather. Although you won't get another chance to see 50-75 \"shooting stars\" in an hour — as was possible last night — it will be wise to look skywards late tonight (preferably after midnight early on Tuesday, Aug.13) if skies are clear for the chance of a healthy number of bright meteors. If you can't escape to truly dark skies, keep any artificial lights away from your direct line of sight because there's always a chance of seeing one or two particularly bright \"fireballs.\" The later you look, the higher the shower's radiant in Perseus will be in the northeastern sky. — Jamie Carter You can also watch the Perseid meteor shower online for free with this livestream hosted by astrophysicist Gianluca Masi of the Virtual Telescope Project. The livestream will begin at 9 p.m. EDT on Aug. 12 (0100 GMT on Aug. 13). Tonight, the moon's eastern side will appear to be half-lit — its so-called first quarter phase — as it reaches its 90-degree angle away from the sun on its monthly orbit of Earth. Since a first-quarter moon always rises around midday and sets around midnight, it begins to bleach the evening night sky to make it more difficult to see stars (and \"shooting stars\" from the Perseid meteor shower). It's nevertheless a beautiful sight for the naked eye. — Jamie Carter There's no better time to see shooting stars from the northern hemisphere than tonight. At its peak, the annual Perseid meteor shower can produce around 60 meteors per hour visible in the night sky. The radiant point (where the meteors will appear to emanate from) will be the constellation Perseus, which will rise in the northeastern sky around midnight. Meteor showers can often be marred by strong moonlight, but not so the Perseids this year since the First Quarter Moon will set around midnight. Look skywards during the early hours of Monday for the best chance of shooting stars, though light pollution and the clarity of the sky will make a huge difference. If you can, get away from light pollution — at least 40 miles from a major urban area is wise — but wherever you watch from, make sure you don’t have any artificial lights in your line of sight. Sit back, relax in a lawn chair, keep warm, and take regular breaks. Never look at your smartphone; its white light will ruin your eyes' dark adaption, which takes about 20 minutes to cultivate and just a single second of white light to ruin. If you cannot look for Perseids in person, you can watch them live online here on Space.com courtesy of the Virtual Telescope Project. The first livestream will begin at 9 p.m. EDT on Aug. 11 (0100 GMT on Aug. 12,) the second will begin at 9 p.m. EDT on Aug. 12 (0100 GMT on Aug. 13) coinciding with the anticipated peak activity of the Perseid meteor shower. About a quarter of the moon's Earth-facing side is now lit by the sun. Across two nights, it will appear on either side of Spica. Arcturus in the constellation Boötes will appear directly above the pair, while to the south, the Milky Way will rise after dark. However, to see the arc of our galaxy, you'll need to be well away from light pollution. -- Jamie Carter Here's another chance to see the crescent moon dominating the post-sunset evening sky, with Venus shining stubbornly close to the western horizon. Look at the moon's dark left side. Can you make out any details? Since no sunlight shines directly on it, it should be dark, right? The light you can see is called \"Planet-shine,\" \"Earthshine,\" or \"Da Vinci Glow.\" It's sunlight shining on Earth and reflecting onto the moon. It's easiest to see in a crescent moon a few days old. -- Jamie Carter A brighter, more obvious crescent moon will tonight be positioned about halfway between Venus, to its lower right, and bright star Spica, to its upper left. One of the 20 brightest stars in the night sky, Spica is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo. -- Jamie Carter",

    "content": "The century-old mystery of dark matter — the invisible glue thought to hold galaxies together — just got a modern clue. Scientists say they may be one step closer to confirming the existence of this elusive material, thanks to new simulations suggesting that a faint glow at the center of the Milky Way could be dark matter's long-sought signature. \"It's very hard to actually prove, but it does seem likely,\" Moorits Muru of the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam in Germany, who led the new study, told Space.com. Dark matter, which makes up about 27% of the matter in the universe, remains one of the biggest riddles in cosmology. It doesn't absorb or reflect light, making it completely invisible to telescopes. Despite decades of experiments, from underground particle detectors to orbiting space observatories, scientists have never detected it directly. Now, however, new computer simulations from Muru's team may have brought us a step closer to decoding the mystery. The findings, show that dark matter near the Milky Way's center might not form a perfect sphere as scientists long thought. Instead, it appears flattened, almost egg-shaped, and that shape closely mirrors the pattern of mysterious gamma rays observed by NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. This builds on research dating back to 2008, when Fermi first spotted a broad, hazy glow of high-energy light near the galactic core, stretching across some 7,000 light-years. The signal was far brighter than existing models could explain. Some scientists proposed that these rays could be the by-product of invisible dark matter particles known as WIMPs (short for weakly interacting massive particles) colliding and annihilating one another. Others argued they came from fast-spinning stellar remnants known as millisecond pulsars — ancient, rapidly spinning neutron stars that emit beams of radiation like cosmic lighthouses. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! The pulsar theory made sense because the gamma-ray glow appeared flattened and bulging, much like the Milky Way's star-filled central region. If dark matter were behind the glow, scientists had expected a smoother, rounder pattern. Muru and his team decided to put both ideas to the test. Using powerful supercomputers, they recreated how the Milky Way formed, including billions of years of violent collisions and mergers with smaller galaxies. Those violent events, the researchers found, left deep \"fingerprints\" on the way dark matter is distributed in the galactic core. When this complex history is factored in, the simulated dark matter halo no longer looks spherical. Instead, it takes on a flattened, egg-like form — matching the pattern of gamma-ray emission Fermi has observed, the new study reports. \"We're showing that dark matter also has this flattened shape,\" Muru said. \"So, it does match the [gamma ray] excess much better than expected before.\" The finding suggests that dark matter could still be a strong contender behind the Milky Way's mysterious glow. But it doesn't completely rule out pulsars, the researchers say. Both possibilities, the team concludes, are now \"essentially indistinguishable.\" If the excess truly arises from dark matter collisions, it would mark the first indirect evidence that WIMPs, a leading dark matter candidate, really exist. Definitive answers could come by the late 2020s, when the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) begins scanning the skies from its twin sites in Chile and Spain. The facility will be able to observe gamma rays at much higher resolution than Fermi, researchers say, potentially helping them distinguish between a swarm of pulsars, which have higher energies, and lower-energy annihilating dark matter particles. Muru added that gamma-ray observations of smaller dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way, whose cores also host dark matter in dense pockets, could further test both possibilities. \"That's where we hope to measure the signal,\" said Muru. \"We're really looking forward to these observations.\" Scientists are convinced dark matter is out there. The quest to detect it arguably remains both one of the most frustrating and most exhilarating challenges in modern physics. \"For some reason, it still eludes us,\" Muru said. \"And I think the mystery makes it even more interesting.\" The results were detailed in a paper published Oct. 16 in the journal Physical Review Letters.

    "content": "This article was originally published at The Conversation. The publication contributed the article to Space.com's Expert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights. Russia is targeting UK space infrastructure, and in particular military satellites, on a weekly basis, according to the head of UK Space Command. In an interview with the BBC, Maj Gen Paul Tedman said that Russia was \"shadowing\" UK satellites. Shadowing involves orbiting and aligning a satellite close to the target satellite, in order to be near enough to jam communications or intercept signals to steal critical information. Tedman said Russia's satellites had \"payloads on board that can see our satellites and are trying to collect information from them\". He also confirmed that jamming of UK military satellites was taking place. This involves broadcasting signals on the same frequencies as those used by satellites, in order to intentionally disrupt or overwhelm legitimate signals. It does not physically damage spacecraft, so as soon as the jamming signal is no longer being emitted, communications can be restored. The jamming of satellite signals can take place from the ground, ocean or air, as well as from space. But what about other tactics that could be used to disrupt satellites? One thing not mentioned in relation to the attacks on British military satellites, is the use of lasers. These can be deployed to dazzle satellites' onboard optical sensors. This can interfere with electronic circuity but would not cause lasting physical damage. The most serious type of attack of course would be the use of a direct-ascent missile, which can be launched from the ground, sea or air, to destroy an orbiting satellite. Previous tests of this kind of anti-satellite (Asat) weapon have generated worrying levels of orbiting debris. This debris can then collide with other satellites, potentially generating even more debris for other space-based assets to avoid. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! On February 24, 2022, the day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, satellite broadband users across Europe got a taste of the kind of attacks that the military is now used to. A cyber-attack was launched against Viasat's Ka-Sat satellite network, which supplies internet access to tens of thousands of people across Ukraine and the rest of Europe. Experts said they believed the purpose of the attack was to interrupt service rather than to access data or systems. A recent talk by German IT researchers also revealed how much damage hackers could potentially do if given unfettered access to a satellite's onboard systems. The experts said that attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in open source software used by NASA and Airbus to control satellites. This in turn could give the intruders access to the control functions on a satellite, allowing them to change its orbit by sending a command to fire its thrusters. Attacks don't need to target the satellite directly. Targeting control stations on the ground can also disrupt operation of the satellites in orbit. This can also have consequences for end users of a satellite service. It’s not just the UK's satellites that are being targeted, however. In September, the head of French space command Maj Gen Vincent Chusseau said there had been a spike in hostile activity in space. Chusseau said activity had increased since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. He said that adversaries, especially Russia, have diversified methods of disrupting satellites and that jamming, lasers and cyber-attacks have become commonplace. The same month, Brig Gen Christopher Horner, commander of 3 Canadian Space Division told a space security summit that there were more than 200 anti-satellite weapons orbiting Earth. While he didn't provide details on their nature, he said it was a \"shocking number\" to threaten allied satellites. It's possible to satellites by improving the encryption of data transmitted to them as well as with anti-jamming technology. This uses a variety of techniques to block out or nullify the signals used by jammers to interfere with satellite communications. It’s also important to ensure there are alternative providers for critical space services as a backup in case of attack. In response to increasing threats to UK satellite infrastructure, the UK government has recently increased its investment in projects geared towards space security. The government has invested £500,000 in a project to develop sensors that counter lasers used to blind satellites. The UK has also recently developed Borealis, a software platform designed to monitor and protect critical UK and allied satellites. As well as investing in its own projects, the UK has also sought to improve space-based security by strengthening international partnerships. For instance, the UK recently invested €163 million (£141 million) in Eutelsat, which provides satellite internet and is a rival to Elon Musk's Starlink system. Starlink’s importance not only for consumers, but also for military applications has been demonstrated in the Ukraine war – where Ukrainian troops had come to rely heavily on it for battlefield communications. But the drawback to this dependency on a privately owned company such as Starlink was highlighted when Musk denied coverage to Kyiv in 2023. The investment in Eutelsat not only strengthens space-based collaboration between the UK and France, but also boosts a company providing a backup system for satellite communications. The US and UK also recently conducted their first coordinated satellite maneuver. The US repositioned one of its own satellites to examine a UK satellite to make sure it was operating normally. Such a maneuver could potentially be used following an attack designed to disable a spacecraft. The reports of Russian meddling highlight the importance of security in orbit as global tensions continue to expand into space.

The NVIDIA H100 GPU, which is about 100 times more powerful than any processor that has flown in space to date, will fly aboard the Starcloud-1 satellite, which is expected to launch atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket next month. The company behind the mission, the Redmond, Washington-based Starcloud, will use the mission to test how data processing could work in space, as the first step in an ambitious plan to build large-scale computing infrastructure in orbit. Moving data crunching to space would reduce the environmental burden that the world's growing computing needs present for communities on Earth, some technologists believe. Data centers consume huge amounts of electricity and water, putting strain on local supplies. They also generate noise and contribute to climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions. In space, power and cooling would be easier to come by, and any potential noise would bother no one. \"In space, you get almost unlimited, low-cost renewable energy,\" Philip Johnston, cofounder and CEO of Starcloud, said in a statement. \"The only cost on the environment will be on the launch; then there will be 10x carbon-dioxide savings over the life of the data center compared with powering the data center terrestrially on Earth.\" To move data centers to space, however, will require launch costs to go down a lot. Starcloud expects that the cost calculation will be just right when SpaceX's Starship megarocket becomes fully operational, which could happen in the early 2030s. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! \"In 10 years, nearly all new data centers will be being built in outer space,\" Johnston predicted. In the meantime, the Starcloud-1 satellite will test the basics of orbital data processing by crunching data from Earth-observing satellites to generate swift insights for users on Earth. High-resolution optical and radar images comprise huge amounts of pixels, requiring satellites to beam to Earth massive data sets. Ground stations are not always available, and bandwidth is limited, so data frequently reaches recipients with delays. Processing data in orbit would remove some of these bottlenecks, as the best images would be identified directly in orbit and sent to Earth during the earliest ground station passage. The Starcloud-1 satellite will also run the Gemma open language model from Google, another major space first. \"Starcloud needs to be competitive with the type of workload you can run on an Earth-based data center, and the NVIDIA H100 GPU is by far the most performant in terms of training, fine-tuning and inference,\" Johnston said. If all goes well, the company will launch more powerful satellites in the coming years, testing more powerful NVIDIA GPUs, including the NVIDIA Blackwell platform, which will offer another up to tenfold improvement in performance, Starcloud said in the statement.

    "content": "Astronomers have unveiled a new catalog of massive galaxy clusters, revealing insight on the evolution of the universe. Galaxy clusters — the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe — act as cosmic signposts that trace the distribution of dark matter and the mysterious dark energy driving the universe's accelerated expansion. Each containing hundreds to thousands of galaxies, these clusters' characteristics such as size depend on how cosmic structures form and evolve. Thus, they're a powerful test of cosmological models. The new catalog of galaxy clusters was assembled using six years of data collected by the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The project leveraged a powerful Dark Energy Camera (DECam) mounted to the 4-meter Blanco Telescope in Chile to provide one of the most detailed looks yet at how matter clumps together across cosmic time, according to a statement from the University of Chicago. Observations from the DES revealed tens of thousands of clusters spanning billions of light-years, giving scientists a vast dataset to measure how structure grows. The DES team used optical and near-infrared observations from the DECam to detect faint galaxies and estimate their distances, building a 3D picture of the cosmic web. One of the main goals was to see whether the universe today behaves as predicted by the leading cosmological model, known as Lambda-Cold Dark Matter (LCDM). For years, scientists have debated a mild mismatch — the so-called \"S8 tension\" — between how strongly matter appears to clump in the present-day universe versus how it should based on early-universe data from the cosmic microwave background. \"Our results find that the Lambda-CDM model describes the observable universe well,\" Chun-Hao To, lead author of the study from the University of UChicago, said in the statement. Because dark matter and dark energy cannot be observed directly, scientists use massive clusters to better understand these mysterious forces, which are known to push galaxies together or apart. And because clusters are so massive, it's easier to see the effects of dark matter and dark energy on them than it would be on smaller objects, the researchers said. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Creating the new catalog required careful modeling of how clusters overlap and how their masses are estimated. Future telescopes like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will probe much deeper. As those observatories come online, astronomers expect to expand the catalog dramatically, tracking how clusters formed across more of the universe’s history. For now, the new DES galaxy cluster catalog offers one of the clearest maps yet of the cosmic landscape. Their findings were published Sept. 18 in the journal Physical Review D.

    "content": "We've discovered and are shining a light on the best star projectors currently available ahead of Black Friday 2025, which falls on November 28. Star projectors come in different shapes and sizes and offer different things. Some can be excellent STEM sets and offer realistic imagery, while others can work well as night lights or for ambiance setting. Some also come with extras like a Bluetooth speaker, a sleep timer (so it doesn't run all through the night) and rotation for moving imagery. The good news is, you don't have to break the bank, as we've highlighted something to suit every budget and need below. With Black Friday 2025 fast approaching, check out our Black Friday deals hub for the biggest and best discounts on star projectors as well as the best telescopes, best binoculars and best cameras, which are all useful for viewing the stars and beyond for real. But, for the best star projectors, read on. Why you can trust Space.com Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test and review products. ✅ You want to explore the skies: There are plenty of discs available for this projector, all of which are scientifically accurate. Most of them are NASA-based imagery. ❌ You're on a budget: This is the most expensive option on this list, so if you're on a budget, there are more suitable options that perform very well. ❌ You just want a pretty light: For anyone who just wants a nice mood-setting light, this will likely be overkill. 🔎 Sega Toys Homestar Flux Great for recreating a realistic-looking night sky inside. It's on the pricier end of the market, but the option to upgrade your disc collection is attractive. The night sky representation is about as realistic as it gets. ★★★★½ You might know Sega as a game company, responsible for Sonic the Hedgehog, Space Channel 5 and many others. But it's also the manufacturer of the best star projector you can currently buy, the Sega Homestar Flux. With the ability to observe over 60,000 stars at once, it truly does bring the night sky inside your home. We've tested the Homestar Flux extensively, and we can confidently say that there are no better star projectors or home planetariums on the market. It offers scientifically accurate views of the sky with beautiful, bright projections that will wow you. The Homestar Flux operates with a disc system which allows you to change which parts of the night sky you're viewing. Two Northern Hemisphere and Northern Hemisphere Constellations (which includes labeled constellations) discs come included with the Homestar Flux, but many more are available to purchase separately. There are 30 discs available for around $18 each when you visit Astrial, Sega Toys' official online store. If you're finding it hard to choose, we can recommend the impressive simulations of the aurora borealis and the aurora australis. There is a disc that displays the planets of the solar system, but the ones that show galaxies, nebulas and other NASA-based imagery are the ones that really stand out. The North America nebula as taken by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and the seven-star system called Jabbah (officially called Nu Scorpii and IC 4592) as imaged by NASA's WISE mission are fascinating. For a sillier kind of skywatching, you can buy discs that simulate fireworks, 'night jellyfish' and a hot-air balloon festival. Like many other star projectors, there is a 'shooting star' function, although in our Sega Homestar Flux review, we found it a bit predictable it wasn't remotely random. Instead, the star always fell in the same spot, and more variation would have made the display feel more real. However, we loved that it comes with an automatic shut-off option after 15, 30 or 60 minutes, which is handy if you're using it to fall asleep. The main downside of this fantastic star projector is it's far more expensive than many other models, but you'll find few that offer the same user experience. It's worth noting that the Sega Toys Homestar Flux is also tough to find, so grab it while it's in stock at one of our trusted retail partners. Premium finish and build quality. Excellent brightness, sharp imagery. Variety of stargazing discs, no novelty lights or lasers. ✅You want quality at a mid-range price: The Orzorz Galaxy Lite star projector rivals the premium models in this guide but costs considerably less. ❌You either want a novelty or premium set: This model isn't a novelty projector and isn't priced like one, but it also isn't the best of the best available. 🔎Orzorz Galaxy Lite star projector: A star projector of genuine quality that rivals some of the premium models in this guide but costs considerably less. The Orzorz Galaxy Lite star projector is a very easy-to-use and high-quality star projector. There's no app or controller for this projector, just buttons that are self-explanatory and can set the sleeper timer and rotation. The timer can be set for 15, 30 and 60 minutes. It features a wide base, which provides stability and it's positioned vertically within the base, so it can rotate 180 degrees with a click in each position to hold the projector securely. When it comes to charging the projector, it has a port for USB-C to charge its battery. This means it can be used while plugged into the mains but also used on the go and the the rechargeable battery gives it a portable element, which is a positive feature that others in this guide don't have. We also like the fact that this projector, despite coming from a relatively unknown manufacturer, comes in professional-looking packaging and doesn't feature any garish colors (only white and grey) with subtle branding. It's quiet in operation, easy to use and has a disc tray and it doesn't feature any lasers or special enhancing features, just a display of the image on the disk and a focus wheel to sharpen the image. White and Gray, vertically positioned, professional-looking packaging rechargeable battery, buttons control timers and rotation ✅ You want to pair it with music: We were impressed with the musical rhythm mode, where the lights flash and dance along to the beat of the music. ❌ You want scientific accuracy: It's not a scientifically accurate projection, although that said, it's the most realistic-looking non-scientific projector we've tested. 🔎 Aurora Borealis Northern Lights Star Projector It's highly customizable, the patterns are realistic and the music rhythm mode is impressive. One of our favourite projectors. ★★★★½ While it's not a scientifically accurate star projector, the Aurora Borealis Northern Lights Star Projector is packed full of great features. This star projector is very customizable: you can choose to display a full moon, change the colors of the Aurora Borealis, make the stars more or less visible, or adjust the LED lights and green lasers to your preferred brightness. There are 16.7 million to choose from (in theory at least; we weren't able to test this as the human eye can't see that many), so you're bound to find one to your taste. We also love that you can control the projector with the remote control it comes with, or through the accompanying app on your smartphone. The Aurora Borealis Northern Lights Star Projector comes with a high-quality built-in Bluetooth speaker which syncs the lighting display to music thanks to its \"rhythm mode\". This is a great feature if you want to create some party ambience. In our Aurora Borealis Northern Lights Star Projector review, we highlighted it as one of our favorites of all the star projectors we've reviewed. It's just a shame that it comes in unbranded packaging, and we found the so-called official website to feel ingenuine. It didn't give us much trust in what we were buying, but thankfully the final product delivered. App or remote (supplied) controlled. ✅ You want a voice activated projector: You can control this projector using your smart home devices (Alexa, Google Home, etc), meaning you don't have to fiddle with buttons to set the mood. ❌ You want it to be scientifically accurate: It doesn't show any constellations or any type of scientific night sky projections. 🔎 Encalife Atmosphere Smart Galaxy Star Projector: Although it is called a Galaxy Star Projector, like most others, this is a pleasant mood-setting light, showing colors and patterns that reflect galaxies and nebulas rather than an accurate starry sky. ★★★★ We love this projector's modern design; unlike most of its competitors, it can blend in among your furniture and looks great in most rooms. It also comes in an attractive packaging, so it would make a lovely gift. In our Encalife Atmosphere Smart Galaxy Projector review, we noted how simple it is to use and set up. But this projector's standout feature is no doubt the voice control: You can use the companion app on your smartphone (available for iOS and Android), or your Amazon Alexa/Google Assistant to voice control your projector. This means you can adjust the brightness, control the rotation speed or change the colors without having to get up from your sofa. The Atmosphere Smart Galaxy Projector boasts 16.7 million colors to choose from; while this sounds impressive, since the human eye can't actually see that many colors with the naked eye, it's a bit of a wasted claim. However, we're pleased to say the colours you can see are beautiful, and the projector offers up a fantastic light show experience. It's worth noting that, breathtaking as it can be, the Atmosphere projector doesn't offer scientifically accurate representations of the stars. So if you're after an educational tool, this won't be the one for you. But if you're simply looking for beautiful ambient light shows, you won't be disappointed with what's on offer here. We love that you can fully tailor the experience to your tastes by adjusting the brightness and projection speed. The Atmosphere Smart Galaxy Projector is USB rechargeable. It can also be adjusted to four angles, so it's flexible enough to project onto both the walls or ceilings. Compact design and shape, premium feel. Bright & vivid colors, responsive controls. ✅ You want a gift for a child: It features a novelty astronaut design that's primarily aimed at children, though in our experience, adults love it too! ❌ The price is too high: This is another star projector where the price fluctuates wildly — we've seen it priced anywhere from $10 to $100. We'd be happy paying anything under $35 for it. 🔎 Astronaut Starry Sky Star Projector: A well-made novelty star projector that every kid, or space fan, will love to have in their bedroom. It isn't quite on par with other star projectors performance-wise, but it does everything we'd expect of it, given its reasonable price. ★★★★ While it's tempting to dismiss low-cost objects that go viral on TikTok, the Astronaut Starry Sky Star Projector proved us wrong. In our Astronaut Starry Sky Star Projector review, we were pleasantly surprised by how well made it was. It shattered our skepticism, ticking all the boxes a fun, novelty star projector should. As you can probably assume from its price point, the Astronaut Starry Sky Star Projector is not a scientifically accurate projector. What it is, however, is a fun light show in an appealing novelty package. It might not provide an introduction to real-world nebulas and star systems, it does produce a fantastic display of light and colour, one that we think makes a great gift for any age. Don't be put off by its underwhelming packaging. In operation, the Astronaut Starry Sky Star Projector is really impressive. As we mentioned in our review, the lighting module seems to be the same — if just a tiny bit less impressive — as other star projectors we have reviewed, including the BlissLights Sky Lite 2.0 and the Encalife Atmosphere Smart Galaxy Star Projector. It isn't based on science, unfortunately, so you won't be able to use this as an educational tool. But as long as you're happy to simply enjoy a pretty visual representation of the night sky, you'll get a lot of joy out of this. It helps that it's very quiet in use, too. Since this is a non-branded product, you'll find many replicas of the Astronaut Starry Sky Star Projector available online. It can be hard to ensure you're buying the proper thing, but you should definitely be cautious of sellers advertising the projector for as little as $10, as you might end up disappointed with a low-quality product. If we're being picky, we didn't love the fact that it's powered by a USB-A to DC cable instead of a USB-C, which would have been a lot more convenient nowadays. Other than that, it's a fantastic gift for any space enthusiast. Novelty design more suited to children, but surprisingly good quality. Bright lights and lasers, pretty patterns. Customizable settings, sleep timer. ✅ You want all the bells and whistles: The Homestar Matataki has got new features that the Homestar Flux didn't have, from twinkling stars to inbuilt sounds. ✅ You already have discs from a Homestar Original or Flux: The Matataki is compatible with discs from previous models, which will save you money. ❌ You want a simple ambient light: This star projector is scientifically accurate and feature-rich, but it comes with a high price tag. ❌ You want a projection to fill the room: The projection circle is relatively small compared with other models that flood the whole room with color. 🔎 The Sega Toys Homestar Matataki is a more 'high-tech' version of its predecessor, introducing the magical twinkling star effect and adding sounds to its light displays. It's a great premium option if your budget extends to it. ★★★★½ If you want a star projector that can sing and dance, the Sega Toys Homestar Matataki is the one for you. This is the newest projector from Sega Toys, expanding on its excellent Homestar Flux (which you'll find at the top of this list). Rather than replace the Flux, however, the Matataki sits alongside it, adding a range of new features. Perhaps the most striking new feature is the addition of a 'twinkle plate' which gives the illusion of twinkling stars and adds a lot of depth to the visual experience. The star projector also comes with sounds included, which is a nice added bonus but by no means a necessity considering the amount of free sleep sounds you can source from streaming platforms. During our Homestar Matataki review, we appreciated how silently it runs and the brightness of the displays. That said, we found the Homestar Flux offers higher-contrast images and sharper stars, which is why it remains at the top of our list. In terms of price and availability, however, the Matataki clearly takes the win against its predecessor. We did appreciate that the discs for the Flux and the Homestar Original are compatible with the Matataki, potentially reducing your investment if you own one of these models. While we love all the extra functionality and the beautiful imagery the Matataki comes with, we just wish Sega Toys had made the projector powered by USB-C or A rather than mains-powered. While this might seem like a trivial issue, it does greatly limit where you can position the projector, and considering this one has a relatively small projection circle, it could be a dealbreaker. Intuitive interface and similar design to other projectors. Bright images and twinkling stars. In-built sounds and premium features. ✅ You want a lot of customization: Although the laser 'stars' can only appear as blue or green (depending on which model you get), you can customize the clouds through the app. ✅ You want a smart home compatible projector: It can work with both a Google and Alexa home device, so you can turn it on and off and give other commands with your voice. ❌ You want it to be scientifically accurate: This projector is for adding atmosphere and projecting pretty colors rather than providing any kind of scientific accuracy. 🔎 BlissLights Sky Lite Evolve The nebulas are bright and endearing, complimented perfectly by the hue of the blue/green lasers. This is a great option for anyone shopping for an aesthetic star projector rather than a scientific one. ★★★½ The BlissLights Sky Lite Evolve has a near 360-degree angling thanks to its spherical design. Few other star projectors offer so much coverage, and the 1.5m cable its comes with means you should be able to position it in the most optimal location in any room. This star projector's smart features are what really stood out in our BlissLights Sky Lite Evolve review. You can use this so-called 'galaxy light' in conjunction with several smart home systems, from Google Assistant to Amazon Alexa, which enables you to change its colours or turn it on or off at the sound of your voice. Perhaps one of the best things about the BlissLights Sky Lite Evolve is how silently it operates, making the experience a truly relaxing one and allowing you to focus on the stars. It also makes use of a patented color-blending technology, which means instead of using solid color blocks, its four LED lamps are capable of providing a broader range of colour options. This results in softer blended colors and a beautiful, almost pastel-like palette, contributing to the calming atmosphere. You can choose between three models — blue, green or no lasers — and we think it's a great pick for lighting up parties, adding ambience to your movie night or gaming tool, or as a a relaxing ambient light to help you fall asleep. Small and discrete, spherical design. ✅ You want realistic imagery: The projections from this projector are incredibly bright, sharp and high resolution, almost indistinguishable from the 'big players'. ❌ You just want something cheap to set the mood: This certainly isn't the most expensive model on this list, but if all you're looking for is a projector with nice lights to create a relaxing atmosphere, there are cheaper options that will do the job. 🔎The Pococo Galaxy Star Projector does what it's supposed to do — it projects high-quality imagery onto any surface to immerse you in the wonders of what the universe has to offer, maintaining a static picture or slowly rotating the image. ★★★★ The Pococo Galaxy Star Projector definitely provides incredible value. For the price, it's solidly-built and in our Pococo Galaxy Star Projector review, we were really impressed with the realistic images it displays. Like the Sega Toys Homestar models, the Pococo Galaxy Star Projector uses discs that display different views of the night sky. They're all scientifically accurate and, aside from the two supplied with the device, more can be picked up separately for around $50 for six. This projector is very easy to control thanks to the three buttons on its body: Power, rotation and sleep timer. It's set apart from other star projectors on the market by its rechargeable battery. It can be charged with a USB-C cable and, since you don't have to have it plugged in when in use, it's great for using in different locations. It's also made of recycled materials, another thing that should please environmentally-conscious buyers. This projector will appeal to both kids and adults. It's available in a stylish color gradient or a matte white finish. Adjusting the clarity of the projection only requires using the focus wheel, which is handy if you want to move it between different surfaces or rooms. The downside of the Pococo's design is you only have 30 degrees of movement to shine the lights, which is considerably less than some of its competitors, but not a deal breaker if you only intent to shine it at the ceiling. Bright, high-resolution projections. Simple operation, no apps needed, rechargeable. ✅ You want scientifically accurate images: The projections are exceptional quality and scientifically accurate giving you, and your children, a chance to learn more about space without a cloudy night getting in the way. ❌ You want a remote control: This projector doesn't come with a remote control which may be bothersome if you're hoping to relax while watching the projections. 🔎 Hommkiety Galaxy Projector For a bargain price, you get amazing and accurate images of space that are great for educational purposes ★★★★★ This is a solid and well-built projector that looks more like a scientific instrument than a toy. There is a premium feel to this projector and, once you start viewing the disks, you'll also be blown away. In our full review of the Hommkiety Galaxy Projector, our reviewer said, \"Only one word came out of our mouth when we first turned on the Hommkiety Galaxy Projector: 'Wow!'\" The image quality is truly astounding, especially when compared to other projectors at more than twice its price. Not only are the images impressive, they are also scientifically accurate which makes this the perfect projector for education. The projector can be positioned to face any wall or ceiling as long as it's on a 180-degree scale. The design makes this projector look more like a telescope than a projector which is quite interesting. To focus it, you simply use the focus wheel on the outside of the projector light — focusing took seconds to accomplish resulting in pin-sharp images. Sadly though, there is no remote control. However, we didn't find this too much of an issue as the controls on the side of the projector are easy to use. The Hommkiety Galaxy Projector comes with ten disks ranging from the Moon, to the Spiral Galaxy, the solar system and even to jellyfish. Every image was vivid and accurate. And a nice addition is the built-in sleep timer, meaning you can view these beautiful images before bed, knowing the projector will eventually turn itself off. Looks like a scientific tool rather than a toy. Image quality is outstanding for the price. USB powered, no remote control but easy to use controls on the projector itself. ✅ You want accurate projections: The projections are true to the date and time that you 'program' it to (if you're in the Northern Hemisphere)✅ You're buying for your child: While it's not a toy, we think it's aimed at a younger audience with a keen interest in astronomy. ❌ You just want something to project nice lights: If you just want an affordable little projector to create ambience, you'd be better off choosing one of the cheaper options on this list. 🔎 The National Geographic Astro Planetarium would make a nice gift for a budding astronomer. It has great functionality, with a time and date selector and a built-in speaker. ★★★★½ In our National Geographic Astro Planetarium review, we found this high-quality indoor planetarium offers true-to-life projections of the starry night sky at great price. This projector is less expensive than the more premium options by Sega Toys, but it still comes with two projection discs: one showing 8,000 stars and another featuring guidelines for major constellations. You also get an accurate view of what you'll see for the time of day you're using it, which adds to the authenticity and its educational qualities. The National Geographic Astro Planetarium is pleasantly easy to use: Simply rotate the image and use the big focus wheel to get the clearest projection. We've found the optics in this star projector to be rather impressive: They come from Bresser, a German brand known for making high-quality binoculars, telescopes and microscopes. This projector is battery-powered, so you don't need it connected to the mains in order to use it. It makes it easier to place it in an optimal place around the room. There's also a 3.5mm jack cable provided in the box which allows you to connect an audio device to it, allowing you to play music or the radio while enjoying the stars. The National Geographic Astro Planetarium has a novel 'falling star' mode. It projects a flashing meteor every 40 seconds, although we think it's a shame the falling star is always in the same place. A level of randomization would make it a bit more enjoyable and unpredictable. Yellow accents not particularly inconspicuous. Projection is bright and easy to focus. ✅ You want a realistic night sky: It comes with two disks — one featuring a starry night sky and the other featuring overlays of constellations — both of which are correct to the time and date you're using it. ❌ You want it to have a speaker: If you want a star projector that features a speaker, you'll have to look at other options. 🔎 Bresser Junior Astro-Planetarium Deluxe This Bresser planetarium star projector, designed for kids, has true-to-life projections, a five-year warranty and is simple to operate. It has a time and date selector, a shooting star function and a sleep timer, and it ships with two disks. ★★★½ The Bresser Junior Astro-Planetarium Deluxe is very similar to the National Geographic Astro Planetarium. The two share a design, in fact, and so operate almost identically. There are key differences, however: for starters, this one doesn't have a speaker or built-in radio. The different color scheme does at least make the Bresser Junior Astro-Planetarium look more grown-up and of a better quality. It's swapped out the bright yellows of the National Geographic planetarium for a more premium-looking silver, which is much less conspicuous-looking, particularly if you're using this as an adult. In our Bresser Junior Astro-Planetarium Deluxe review, we found that the same Astro Planetarium discs can be used in both the Bresser and the National Geographic devices, and two are included in the box: one features a starry night sky, and the other has constellation overlays. You can set a day and time on the device, making the projections accurate for that time — a very nifty feature to help with skywatching. You can rotate the image in its stand, and it's fully mobile with built-in motors allowing for 360-degree movement. We found that it works best when the images are projected from about two meters away. Bresser designed the lens with a focusing wheel for easy image adjustment. Like many star projectors, it has automatic shutdown options after 30, 60 or 120 minutes, making it suitable for kids who want to fall asleep under a starry sky in their bedroom. Additionally, it includes a shooting star mode, projecting a 'meteor' every 40 seconds. There are minimal differences between this and the National Geographic Astro Planetarium, but this one is a little cheaper. If you don't want music compatibility and you're happy for it to be battery-powered, it's probably worth considering over the other. Silver & black design, but dated packaging. Date & time feature works well. Battery powered (no mains option). ✅ You want something portable: This star projector is so small it could be mistaken for a flash drive, so it's perfect to take on the go. ❌ You want customization: If you want to change the colors, brightness or add rotation to the lasers, then you'll want to go for a different model. 🔎 BlissLights Starport USB star projector A pocketable device for adding instant ambiance to parties, gaming rooms, music studios or spas, this could very loosely be considered a star projector. ★★★½ The BlissLights Starport USB star projector is unlike any other in our guide, given that it relies on a USB connection and is far more of a compact package. This is a hassle-free device and also one of the most budget-friendly, but it can still transform the atmosphere around you with stunning projections. We'd use the term 'star projector' sparingly, however, as it isn't entirely scientifically accurate. To operate the BlissLights Starport, simply plug it into to a USB power source, and sit back and enjoy the show. It fills the room with hundreds of laser stars which look absolutely beautiful. Unlike other devices on this list, however, there are no customization options and, unsurprisingly, it's not scientifically accurate. If you're looking for a simple night sky light show to add ambience to any room, we think the BlissLIghts Starport USB star projector is a great choice. It's inexpensive and takes up almost no space. If you travel a lot, it could be a perfect way to see the stars in your hotel room, for example. If you want more advanced features or something more scientifically accurate, however, this isn't the right product for you. Tiny device, looks like a flash drive. Lasers are very bright and fill a large area. Does what it's meant to and nothing more. ✅ You want a projector & speaker combo: This is a 2-in-1 projector with a surprisingly high quality speaker. ❌ You want something scientifically accurate: Much like all the cheaper options on this list, this projector is solely for mood and ambiance rather than scientific accuracy. 🔎 Encalife Ambience Galaxy & Star Projector: A neat combination of a star projector and Bluetooth speaker built into one. It isn't scientifically accurate but it displays vivid nebula-inspired patterns to enhance the ambience in any room. ★★★½ Compared to the Atmosphere Smart Galaxy Projector, the Ambience Galaxy & Star Projector has fewer lighting modes, but we don't see it as a drawback. It provides four colors (blue, green, white and red) which you can blend using the remote control included. You can also adjust the brightness according to your preference. Considering the mediocre packaging, we were pleasantly surprised by how sturdy this star projector's construction was. The unit is well-built, and we found the lights bright enough to create a very pleasant atmosphere bound to enhance any party. Its sleek black color blends in with many home decors, and it can also function as a music player, allowing you to listen to your favorite music or atmospheric sounds as you watch the celestial shadows dance across the ceiling and walls. In our Encalife Ambience Galaxy and Star Projector review, we found the speaker to be surprisingly high quality and audibly well-rounded. The faceted dome shape means the lights can be projected and dispersed over 180-degrees, so the entire ceiling is covered with lights. You'll need to set up your phone's Bluetooth before you start using the projector, which is easy enough to do, and then you'll be up and running in no time. Like the Atmosphere Smart Galaxy Projector, you won't get scientific accuracy, but you'll get a beautiful light show that can help you or your children to sleep better at night. Nice amount of customization, decent in-built speaker. ✅You want realistic projections: This is a no-frills star projector that offers realistic projections of the night sky. ❌You want extras: This comes with very few bells and whistles. No Bluetooth connectivity or built-in speaker feature here. 🔎Sega Toys Homestar classic: It's up there with the best on the market. It's projections are fantastic and it looks great, although it is on the expensive side and offers few extras. The Sega Toys Homestar Classic was first released back in 2006 and even though Sega Toys has since released the Flux and Matataki star projectors, the Classic still holds up today and has aged well. Its main selling points are the top-tier projections and realistic imagery it offers. Two interchangeable disks contain the fixed stars of the Northern Hemisphere projected from a 3-Watt LED light bulb. While some projectors offer Nebulae projections too, the Classic focuses on Stars, and they look spectacular in dark conditions. Further disks are available for purchase, too. It's a no-frills star projector that offers little in the way of extras or novelties. An AC power adapter is included so it can be powered by the mains. To save power usage, it comes with a built-in timer that can be set to 15, 30 or 60 minutes. It also has a 'move' option, which will offer a gentle panning effect of the projections you see and a 'Shooting Star' option that projects random shooting stars to appear across the current projection. It doesn't, however, come with a built-in speaker, Bluetooth connectivity or a rechargeable battery. We think the Classic looks pretty neat and it doesn't need to have a unique design or a novelty look to stand out. It matches the Flux and the Matataki for maximum projection and it's cheaper than other high-end models. Overall, this is one of the best star projectors you can get and a great choice if you do decide to own one. It is slightly cheaper than other high-end models but it is more expensive than most of the market, and more expensive than other projectors that offer more. It projects fantastic, realistic imagery and is great for STEM and pure projection purposes. However, if you're not willing to spend a lot on a star projector, there are other, perfectly fine options available. top-tier projections while almost silent Mains powered, uses disks and has a built-in timer ✅You want something to double up as a night light or lamp: The Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light can suitably light up a room for relaxation. ❌You want any kind of accuracy: While it offers a lot of quality, especially for the price, the projections can be described as nebulae-like at best. 🔎Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light: A great budget option that can work as a lamp or night light, but won't offer you scientific accuracy... Or much accuracy at all for that matter. If you're looking for a night light or a lamp that can really set the mood for relaxation, the Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light could be what you want. Its sub-$20 price tag makes it an attractive prospect and the quality it offers, especially in our review, means it's definitely worth considering. Our only gripe with it is that it doesn't offer projections of stars... Or galaxies, like the name suggests. The projector itself features a wooden base along with an acrylic cover over the bulb which resembles frosted glass. It looks surprisingly premium and it's the acrylic bulb cover that gives the projections their effects. The build is sturdy but there are no control buttons on the lamp unit, which means everything is controlled via the remote. The Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light doesn't offer any star projections from lasers, which is probably a good thing, as they often come across as tacky at this price point. But, it also doesn't offer any galaxy projections either. Instead, the wavy, frosted glass effect of the acrylic cover means projections are more nebulae-like. Even then, it's a bit of a stretch to call it that. But, the LED bulb works well and there are 16 RGB colors to choose from as well as multiple brightness settings, so it's not all bad news on the projections front. In fact, what it does do, it does really well, which is why we think it's a great option for a night light and/or a lamp. With the projector being USB-powered, you'll need to keep it close to a mains socket or at very least, a power unit. Given its size, it's not too imposing to have on a bedside table or a desk, meaning it works well for nighttime unwinding. There isn't a sleep timer on it though, so you will have to turn it off manually if you don't want it running through the night. But, it does operate quietly, so if you do nod off, you won't be disturbed by a constant buzzing or whirring in the background. In short, this Jiawen Galaxy Projector offers surprising quality for a really low price. It works well as an ambience setter and a night light. It's a bit of a stretch to label it a galaxy projector as the name would suggest but you can see the effect of the acrylic cover means the projections do lean that way. It's a shame it doesn't feature a speaker or a sleep timer but the sturdy build and the quality LED bulb mean you do get value for money with this projector. Bright light, not strictly a star projector Powered by USB, remote controlled, no sleeper timer or speaker The Sega Toys Homestar Flux is the best star projector you can buy right now. We’ve tested and reviewed a range of star projectors and found no projections more accurate and beautiful than with this premium product. You also have the possibility of buying up to 30 extra disks to project the Milky Way, shooting stars, and the aurora. There isn't a definitive \"best time\" as you can find star projector deals throughout the year via many retailers. However, the safest bet is during annual sales events like Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday, which this year falls on November 28. This is because we usually see the broadest range of discounts, which typically cover star projectors, and the biggest offers often come during these sales events. You should find these discounts available with reputable retailers too, so you can rely on the quality of the product and the ability to return something if you're not satisfied with your purchase. Not all star projectors are scientifically accurate — some are designed to be pleasant ambient lights to be used as kids' night lights or just to create a relaxing atmosphere. However, some models are scientifically accurate and allow you to create a planetarium from the comfort of your own home, for example the Sega Toys Homestar Flux, National Geographic Astro Planetarium and Bresser Junior Astro-Planetarium Deluxe. While the terms are often used interchangeably, star projectors can also be used to refer to unrealistic night and ambient or mood-enhancing lights that aren't scientifically accurate. Planetariums, on the other hand, are strictly realistic and accurate depictions of the night sky, which are sometimes even time and location-sensitive to show you the night sky as it appears at a given time. In this buying guide, we've tested and reviewed a range of star projectors and ranked them according to performance, quality and budget. We've included a variety of options at different price points with a range of features, so you're sure to find one that suits you. We continue to monitor the market for different models, and we'll share our favorites with you. In theory, yes. Most of the star projectors in this guide are AC mains-powered or DC-powered through USB ports, so as long as they're plugged in, they can run. Some, however, are battery-powered, meaning you run the risk of the battery running out overnight. For those who want to use them as night lights, many star projectors come with a 'sleep timer' that will switch the device off after a specified amount of minutes. It's important to check the manual that comes with your star projector before you leave it running for extended periods of time, as some models may become hot after prolonged use. Always resort to the manual if in doubt and follow the instructions. The star projectors designed to be night lights can be good for babies and small children as they create a soothing ambient light. They can even make bedtime routines more fun and help your child drift off to sleep. However, it's worth noting that some models include small flashes of light and swirling light patterns, so they may not be suitable for babies with light sensitivities or conditions like epilepsy. If in doubt, consult your doctor or local physician before using them. Most of the star projectors in this guide are available to buy from Amazon. You can find links underneath each product review that will take you to recommended merchants' websites, including Amazon. Prices vary depending on the model of your choice and how many features you are after. Generally, you can buy a good quality star projector for anywhere between $25 and $250. The cheaper models tend to be destined to be used as night lights and are generally inaccurate in their depiction of the night sky. More premium models like the Sega Toys Homestar Flux are more expensive but offer scientifically accurate depictions of the night sky. The answer to this question depends on the type of star projector you're considering. Some FDA-approved laser star projectors are safe for brief and accidental exposure to eyes, but they are not recommended for children, and you should never look directly into a laser beam. The U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states that 'The FDA recognizes four major hazard classes (I to IV) of lasers, including three subclasses (IIa, IIIa, and IIIb). The higher the class, the more powerful the laser is and the greater the potential to pose serious injury if used improperly.' In reference to Class IIIa lasers (like laser pointers or some used in star projectors), the FDA says: 'Depending on power and beam area, can be momentarily hazardous when directly viewed or when staring directly at the beam with an unaided eye. Risk of injury increases when viewed with optical aids.' If in doubt, check the laser classification on the device before purchasing and check it against the FDA rules, or a relevant health and safety body in your region. This year, Black Friday 2025 falls on November 28. We usually see big offers on star projectors and we're hoping this year is no exception. You should see sizeable offers run through the weekend and into Cyber Monday, which is the following Monday, December 1. To guarantee you're getting honest, up-to-date recommendations on the best star projectors to buy here at Space.com we make sure to put every star projector through a rigorous review to fully test each product. Each star projector is reviewed based on a multitude of aspects, from its construction and design, to how well it functions as a star projector and whether it provides accurate night sky imagery. Best telescopes: top picks for viewing the cosmos Best telescopes for beginnersBest binoculars for stargazingBest cameras for astrophotography Each star projector is tested by either our expert staff or knowledgeable freelance contributors who know their subject areas in depth. This ensures fair reviewing is backed by personal, hands-on experience with each star projector and is judged based on its price point, class and destined use. For example, comparing a top-of-the-range star projector from one of the largest producers of star projectors to a make-your-own kit made from cardboard wouldn't be appropriate, though each star projector might be the best-performing product in its own class, and that is how we've categorized them in this guide. 1. If you want it to be scientific, look for a simulation according to the actual time and day. 2. The smaller the room, the sharper the stars will look. 3. Check how many disks come with each product (if it uses them) or see if you can purchase add-ons. 4. Choose a model with a sleep-timer if using it as a night light. 5. Decide if you want to control it with a remote, app or smart device. We look at how easy each star projector is to operate, test out all their functions to see if they are effective and work as advertised. We check that the projections are good, that the build quality is fit for purpose and make suggestions for the most appropriate use of each unit.

    "content": "The next full moon will be on Wednesday, Nov. 5. It will officially reach its full moon phase at 8:19 a.m. EDT (1319 GMT), but local moonrise times vary depending on location. The moon will still appear full the night before and after its peak to the casual stargazer. Want to see the moon up close? We recommend the Celestron StarSense Explorer DX 130AZ as the best for basic astrophotography in our best beginner's telescope guide. Most of the time, the full moon isn't perfectly full. We always see the same side of the moon, but part of it is in shadow, due to the moon's rotation. Only when the moon, Earth and the sun are perfectly aligned is the moon 100% full. And sometimes — once in a blue moon — the moon is full twice in a month (or four times in a season, depending on which definition you prefer). If you want to know what you can see tonight check out our night sky live blog or if you want to plan further ahead our monthly skywatching guide highlights key targets for the month. Fancy taking a more in-depth moonlit tour of our rocky companion? Our ultimate guide to observing the moon will help you plan your next skywatching venture whether it be exploring the lunar seas, mountainous terrain, or the many craters that blanket the landscape. You can also see where astronauts, rovers and landers have ventured with our Apollo landing sites observing guide. You can prepare for the next full moon or eclipse with our guides on how to photograph the moon and how to photograph a lunar eclipse.

Floating 3D Moon Night Light Lamp | RRP $239.97 | Now: $139.97 If you know someone who can't get enough of the moon, then they'll be delighted with this floating 3D lamp from encalife. Using magnetic levitation technology, the realistic globe will project \"moonlight\" as it floats and spins in mid-air. Comes in three color modes and wireless LED charging. This is when full moons will occur in 2025, according to NASA's SKYCAL Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Note: Local moonrise times will vary depending on your location. — Best telescopes for beginners Many cultures have given distinct names to each month's full moon. The names were applied to the entire month in which each occurred. The Farmer's Almanac lists several names that are commonly used in the United States. There are some variations in the moon names, but in general, the same ones were used among the Algonquin tribes from New England on west to Lake Superior. European settlers followed their own customs and created some of their own names. Other Native American people had different names. In the book \"This Day in North American Indian History\" (Da Capo Press, 2002), author Phil Konstantin lists more than 50 native peoples and their names for full moons. He also lists them on his website, AmericanIndian.net. Amateur astronomer Keith Cooley has a brief list of the moon names of other cultures, including Chinese and Celtic, on his website. — How to observe the moon with a telescope — What you can see in this month's night sky — The moon: 10 surprising facts Full moon names often correspond to seasonal markers, so a Harvest Moon occurs at the end of the growing season, in September or October, and the Cold Moon occurs in frosty December. At least, that's how it works in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, where the seasons are switched, the Harvest Moon occurs in March and the Cold Moon is in June. According to Earthsky.org, these are common names for full moons south of the equator.

It also takes about 27 days for the moon to rotate on its axis. So, the moon always shows us the same face; there is no single \"dark side\" of the moon. As the moon revolves around Earth, it is illuminated from varying angles by the sun — what we see when we look at the moon is reflected sunlight. On average, the moon rises about 50 minutes later each day, which means sometimes it rises during daylight and other times at night. There are four phases of the moon, new moon, first quarter moon, full moon and third quarter moon. At new moon, the moon is between Earth and the sun, so that the side of the moon facing toward us receives no direct sunlight, and is lit only by dim sunlight reflected from Earth. A few days later, as the moon moves around Earth, the side we can see gradually becomes more illuminated by direct sunlight. This thin sliver is called the waxing crescent. A week after the new moon, the moon is 90 degrees away from the sun in the sky and is half-illuminated from our point of view — what we call first quarter because it is about a quarter of the way around Earth. A few days later, the area of illumination continues to increase. More than half of the moon's face appears to be getting sunlight. This phase is called a waxing gibbous moon. When the moon has moved 180 degrees from its new moon position, the sun, Earth and the moon form a line. The moon’s disk is as close as it can be to being fully illuminated by the sun, so this is called full moon. Next, the moon moves until more than half of its face appears to be getting sunlight, but the amount is decreasing. This is the waning gibbous phase. Days later, the moon has moved another quarter of the way around Earth, to the third quarter position. The sun's light is now shining on the other half of the visible face of the moon. Next, the moon moves into the waning crescent phase as less than half of its face appears to be getting sunlight, and the amount is decreasing. Finally, the moon moves back to its new moon starting position. Because the moon’s orbit is not exactly in the same plane as Earth’s orbit around the sun, they rarely are perfectly aligned. Usually the moon passes above or below the sun from our vantage point, but occasionally it passes right in front of the sun, and we get an eclipse of the sun. Each full moon is calculated to occur at an exact moment, which may or may not be near the time the moon rises where you are. So when a full moon rises, it’s typically doing so some hours before or after the actual time when it’s technically full, but a casual skywatcher won’t notice the difference. In fact, the moon will often look roughly the same on two consecutive nights surrounding the full moon. Lunar eclipses are inextricably tied to the full moon. To find out where and when you can see the next lunar eclipse check out our lunar eclipse guide. When the moon is in its full phase, it passes behind the Earth with respect to the sun and can pass through Earth's shadow, creating a lunar eclipse. When the moon is fully inside the Earth's shadow, we see a total lunar eclipse. At other times, the moon only partially passes through the Earth's shadow in what is known as a partial, or even penumbral lunar eclipse (when the moon only skirts through the outermost region of Earth's shadow). There are two lunar eclipses in 2025: A total lunar eclipse on March 14 and a total lunar eclipse on Sept. 7. When the moon is in its \"new\" phase, it passes between the Earth and the sun, so the side facing the Earth appears dark. To find out when and where you can see the next solar eclipse, check out our solar eclipse guide. Occasionally, the moon's orbit lines up with the sun in such a way that part or all of the sun can be blocked by the moon, as viewed from Earth. When the moon completely blocks the sun's disk, we see a total solar eclipse during the day, which can be a truly awe-inspiring site. Other times, the moon can only partially block the sun in a partial solar eclipse. The moon can even create a \"ring of fire\" solar eclipse when it passes directly in front of the sun, but is at a point in its orbit that is too far from Earth to fully cover the sun's disk. This leaves a ring, or \"annulus,\" around the moon to create what is called an annular solar eclipse. There are two partial solar eclipses in 2025, they will occur on March 29 and Sept. 21.

That's how easy it is now to get lost in the absolutely stunning scape that is our planet Earth from space as it streams live before your eyes. Sen, a company based in London, provides views of Earth from orbit, with the hopes of making an experience usually reserved for astronauts a little more accessible to the rest of humanity. It's live video of Earth from space, 24 hours a day and seven days a week. The overview effect is a phenomenon known to occur for those lucky enough to travel beyond the bounds of our gravity well, in which the view of our planet from space changes one's perception of his or home planet and humanity. Apollo 14 astronaut Ed Mitchell described it as \"an instant global consciousness,\" accompanied with \"an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world and a compulsion to do something about it.\" Sen launched three Ultra High Definition 4k cameras to the ISS on SpaceX's CRS-30 cargo mission to the space station in March 2024. The trio, collectively called SpaceTV-1, are mounted to the Bartolomeo platform on the European Space Agency's (ESA) Columbus module to create three unique views of Earth and the space station. One camera is oriented to capture the long curve of Earth's horizon, and the repeatedly rising and setting sun is visible as the ISS completes another orbit every 90 minutes. Another focuses directly on Earth below, showing a stretch about 155 miles (250 kilometers) across. The third camera looks at the space station's forward docking port, connected to the the Harmony module, and any visiting spacecraft that are docked there. Sen’s vision is to democratize space using video to inform, educate, inspire and benefit all humanity. To do this, the company is streaming real-time videos from space to billions of people, gathering news and information about Earth and space and making it universally accessible and useful. Sen is a data business using its own micro satellites and hosted cameras to stream real-time videos and information about Earth direct to individuals, creating a unique dataset for all humanity, empowering people and inspiring global change. Sen’s vision is a humanitarian one — to help raise awareness about planetary changes and to support those directly affected by events on Earth, and to help inform people about the reality of our existence in space. Sen will give people videos of Earth, other worlds and space. Augmented Reality will be used to overlay the story-telling power of video with additional information, providing multi-world data and unique new perspectives for humanity. Sen provides its streams from space for free. You can download Sen's mobile app or watch the company's stream directly on Sen.com or its YouTube channel.

She’s now succeeded in throwing out Tesla’s arbitration case against her, and hopes to meet Tesla directly in open court in a case that could influence corporate policy nationwide. Cristina Balan is a Romanian-born engineer who formerly worked for Tesla on the Model S. Her contributions were significant enough that her initials appeared on the Model S’ battery pack. But in 2014, she brought up what she considered a safety issue directly with Elon Musk. She thought that the Model S’ floor mats could cause a brake safety issue, similar to a situation that Toyota had recently gone through (though that also led to a media firestorm that blew the issue out of proportion). She said that Tesla had chosen suppliers based on friendships, not quality. And she brought it up directly to Musk because… he told her to. Famously, in 2013, Musk sent out an email to the entire company stating: Anyone at Tesla can and should email/talk to anyone else according to what they think is the fastest way to solve a problem for the benefit of the whole company. You can talk to your manager’s manager without his permission, you can talk directly to a VP in another dept, you can talk to me, you can talk to anyone without anyone else’s permission. Moreover, you should consider yourself obligated to do so until the right thing happens. -Elon Musk, email to all Tesla employees, March 21, 2013 A few days after sending that email, Balan said she was offered a meeting with Musk, but that when she showed up to the meeting, it was instead attended by a lawyer and some large men in uniforms, and with Tesla forcing her to resign her position. During that meeting, Balan says that Tesla’s lawyer threatened to deport many members of her team, who were currently waiting on green card applications, if she didn’t sign the resignation, seemingly in response to her team backing her up in raising these concerns. She ended up signing the resignation in protest, writing on it that “I’m resigning for the position that I was put in a month ago bc I dare to speak up to the Sr management, also bc people that had the chance to speak up were threatened…” When Balan’s case got coverage in Huffington Post in 2017, Tesla sent a statement that Balan had stolen company resources to work on a “secret” personal project (Tesla emails show that Balan was told to work on this project by leadership). After this, Balan says she faced difficulty in finding work as companies feared ending up on Musk’s blacklist. Balan filed a defamation suit over the press statement, but Tesla forced her case into arbitration and got the defamation suit thrown out. Forced arbitration is widely used by companies in America to find faster and more corporate-friendly rulings, an approach that has only become more common after endorsement by the “Supreme” Court. Balan then appealed that decision, and after many delays (some related to her fight against breast cancer, which is now in remission), she finally succeeded in getting the arbitration thrown out on Monday – even though she represented herself, pro se, for most of the proceedings. Her win could be significant for corporate policy nationwide, as it could serve to chill the overuse of arbitration which is seen by most observers as giving disproportionate power to companies in labor disputes. However, given the nature of the court’s recent finding, which was found to be a jurisdictional issue, this decision may not be directly applicable to many other arbitration cases. Now, Balan wants to face Tesla in open court with her case, and hopes to bring more of her story to the public – which she says Musk has tried to stop her from doing, despite his claims of being a “free speech absolutist.” She said so in an interview this weekend with The Times UK, a media organization owned by climate denier Rupert Murdoch, who is also the father of James Murdoch, a Tesla boardmember. In the interview, Balan describes working conditions under Musk, and that he was a mostly-absent CEO who only showed up to the office twice a month, would threaten or retaliate against those who tried to fix problems. She says that she wants to take her case to open court “to prove how vindictive this monster is. He’s pure evil… he’s enjoying hurting people… and you don’t know about them because he’s forcing everybody to give up their freedom of speech and their right to sue.” You can watch the whole interview below: We haven’t written about Balan’s case before because it’s been such a long time coming, and filled with various arcane legal wranglings. There will likely be more steps to come, many of which are boring legal maneuvers, but perhaps this case will now have a chance to go more public now that the arbitration decision has been thrown out. And, frankly, I think the initial complaint over floor mats was probably not all that significant of a blockbuster. At the time, floor mats were getting a lot of focus due to the high-profile nature of the Toyota case (which was also overstated), so I think Balan’s team was probably more wary than usual. And we didn’t go on to see a slate of floor mat problems with the Model S in the time since. However, Tesla’s response to bringing up the safety issue is still unacceptable (to say the least). Not only were all employees told to take steps like this to get problems solved by the CEO himself, but the strong-arm nature of a quick firing in response, and then threatening her team with deportation is beyond the pale. While we only have Balan’s words as evidence for the deportation threat, we have since seen Musk take vindictive actions against entire teams, and seen his anti-immigrant attitudes including the desire to deport people illegally. Recently Musk fired the entire supercharger team, in what was probably the dumbest business decision Tesla has ever made, reportedly because Rebecca Tinucci, a star of the auto industry and the head of the most successful team in Tesla, refused to fire more people. (Incidentally, another longtime Tesla exec who was fired at the same time as the whole Supercharger team, Daniel Ho, had previously praised Balan, saying “without creative engineers like you, this place would be just another car company”) And Musk is also the largest financial backer of an administration that is currently illegally deporting legal residents to a prison famous for beatings, overcrowding and food deprivation that some have called a place to “dispose of people without formally applying the death penalty” – and threatening to do the same to US citizens. \"Balan says that Tesla’s lawyer threatened to deport many members of her team, who were currently waiting on green card applications, if she didn’t sign the resignation, seemingly in response to her team backing her up in raising these concerns.\" There it is. Elon abusing workers with lawfare. This is why he so desperately wants H-1b visas....so he can have low cost labor trapped in their jobs. Musk has spent much of his public advocacy in recent years showing racist and anti-immigrant attitudes, including support for German neo-Nazis and agreeing with a defense of Hitler’s actions in the Holocaust. He’s focused more on pushing his white supremacist views than on anything to do with EVs and climate change (which he’s now pushing denial of), thus working against Tesla’s mission. So, making deportation threats against immigrants does not seem out of character, despite Musk being a formerly “illegal” immigrant himself. Either way, we look forward to hearing more about this case as it goes on, in the hopes that it can both elucidate more for the public what the real Elon Musk is like, and possibly do something to reduce, ever so slightly, the abuse of the arbitration system by companies.

    "content": "When Tesla CEO Elon Musk publicly denied a report that Tesla had canceled its work on the $25,000 “Model 2” despite the project ending weeks prior, Tesla executives were “alarmed” by Musk’s public lie, according to a new report by Reuters. In April 2024, Reuters reported that the long-awaited $25,000 Tesla, nicknamed “Model 2” by the public, had been canceled. Immediately after the report, Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded, stating “Reuters is lying (again).” However, when he made this statement, Musk knew that the report was correct, and that he had cancelled the project weeks earlier. This new information comes from a report by Reuters today, citing company documents and the standard “people familiar with the matter.” The public denial caused confusion among Tesla executives, some of whom wondered if the project was back on, or who were concerned that customers may delay purchases waiting for a product that they and Musk knew would never come. It also concerned executives due to an agreement Musk made with the SEC which required a lawyer to oversee his Tesla-related tweeting activities, after he had previously been caught misleading investors into thinking he had secured funding to take Tesla private. Musk’s lie about the $25k Model 2 project stopped a decline in TSLA stock, which had slid by 6% so far that day, and the stock recovered partially by the end of the day. Given the market-moving nature of the statement, and the subject matter of being about Tesla’s future plans, it was thought that this would be another clear violation of Musk’s settlement with the SEC. Musk has a long history of taking umbrage with the press and government regulators, and getting in public fights with people for the smallest of slights. These attacks are often immature, as in the examples of his lewd statements about the SEC, or an unnecessary attack on a diver during a rescue operation. Reuters has been one of his main targets, but he has generally shown disdain for the media, and this attitude isn’t new. In 2018, he floated the idea of creating a website to rank “truth” in media, proposing the name “Pravduh.” The idea came after a series of negative reports about Tesla, making it clear that the effort was less about truth, and more about Musk feeling slighted about recent coverage. In a similar vein to his attacks on Reuters, he and the Tesla board recently denied a WSJ report that they were seeking a replacement for Musk as CEO. Musk responded personally, stating that it was an “EXTREMELY BAD BREACH OF ETHICS” for WSJ to publish a “DELIBERATELY FALSE ARTICLE and fail to include an unequivocal denial,” even though WSJ reached out to Tesla and was given no comment beforehand. One of the reasons WSJ couldn’t get comment beforehand is because Tesla dissolved its PR department years ago. Companies keep PR departments so that press can have a clear a consistent idea of a company’s position on the matter, and so that journalists can reach out to the company for comment beforehand. Musk’s anger at WSJ for not including a denial from a department that he himself dissolved suggests that perhaps he relishes the opportunity to strike out against the media, as his own actions have been responsible for the lack of communication between Tesla and the media. At this point everyone knows his reputation except for people that choose to believe what he says. The sales numbers have been dismal in Europe, China, and here in the US but he speaks as though everything is okay and everyone is having issues. The numbers tell a different story but at the rate things are going we will have to see how long the truth evades him. He even targeted us here at Electrek after we published a true and fair article critiquing Tesla’s plan to charge owners $1,500 for hardware they already bought. After our report, many other media reported the same story, and a few days later Tesla lowered the price to $1,000 (when it still should be zero, and at least one owner has prevailed in small claims due to our report). Immediately after Tesla lowered the price of the upgrade, we found that Elon Musk had blocked our site’s account on Twitter, and also blocked my colleague Fred Lambert, who was not involved in reporting the story. We were also banned from future Tesla events due to our true and fair report. If you’re considering going solar, it’s always a good idea to get quotes from a few installers.

    "content": "Tesla just dropped its Q1 2025 earnings and the news isn’t great, as sales and profits have fallen significantly and missed already-low expectations. And in the earnings report, the company has issued what seems to be an admission that its own CEO’s actions are to blame. It’s been a rough time for Tesla employees lately. The company’s mission is an admirable one: to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable transportation. Many employees joined the company with that mission in mind, wanting to do something positive for the world. But in recent times, the highest-profile employee of the company, its CEO and largest individual shareholder Elon Musk, has moved away from that mission. He spent huge sums from his personal wealth to campaign for an anti-EV political candidate, and is now actively participating in politics as an ally to those anti-EV forces and spreading climate misinformation along the way. He’s also famously vindictive and Tesla’s board refuses to rein him in as he works to destroy the company. So what is a Tesla employee to do, in this case? On the one hand, they want to do what’s right for the company. On the other hand, they don’t want to attract the ire of their boss who wants to do what’s wrong for the company. When your livelihood is at stake, sometimes you’ll choose to just keep your head down, keep working the best you can, and hope in vain that at some point the CEO might change his mind and stop acting like an idiot, or the board might finally step in for the good of the company. (Or, alternately, if you have other options, you might quit to make a statement, like many executives have) However, we’ve seen some instances of some Tesla employees trying to do something, anything, to cry out to the world that all of this isn’t normal. And one example of that comes from Tesla’s earnings report today. It’s right there in the third paragraph of the summary at the beginning of the document: Uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers. This sort of statement is not a surprise to see in a quarterly report in the environment we’re currently in. The US stock market and economy as a whole are showing increasingly worrying signs, almost entirely due to the flailing actions of the ignoramuses who somehow find themselves in the Oval Office (despite that there exists a clear legal remedy stopping insurrectionists from holding office in the US). These actions have included the announcement of several tariffs (even though that is the purview of Congress), seemingly determined randomly through a dumb formula that didn’t even use the right numbers, and which seem to change every day (as one would expect when the person implementing them is senile and was profoundly stupid even before he went senile). This idiotic flailing has produced the expected response: retaliatory tariffs, distrust from the international community, less availability of goods domestically, chaos among the business community, and pushing nations we consider as our rivals closer to the rest of the world. Businesses, on the whole, have tried to stick to factual statements in their earnings reports and business forecasts. But despite that these statements are generally dry, the message remains clear: tariffs will increase costs for everyone and make business more difficult. And Tesla’s statement is similarly dry, pointing to the uncertainty of ever-changing tariff decisions and how they will affect supply chains and cost. This is especially true for Tesla Energy, which will be affected much more than its car business, as Tesla also acknowledged today, stating “the current tariff landscape will have a relatively larger impact on our Energy business compared to automotive.” But for Tesla, this is still exceptional given that the company’s moonlighting CEO, who spends little time working on Tesla business and is otherwise occupied with his twitter addiction, stealing Tesla resources for his private AI company, and trying to shut down the Environmental Protection Agency. Along with all this, Musk is also an advisor in the very administration that is making Tesla’s business difficult. Musk has stated his opposition to tariffs, but he himself has to walk a thin line and occasionally downplay his language, given his self-professed “love” for Mr. Trump. And, despite this supposed opposition, he still remains one of the largest financial backers of the tariff advocate in question. But tariffs aren’t the only thing that will make Tesla’s business difficult, as Tesla acknowledged today in its letter. It continued to say: This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term. Again, a rather dry statement elucidating a very significant problem with the company at the moment. It’s not so much that political sentiment about EVs is changing, as EV sales continue to grow globally, despite headlines falsely suggesting otherwise. It’s sentiment against Tesla that is changing, largely due to Musk’s involvement in politics. The main driver of Tesla’s recent sales decline has been Musk’s high-profile political advocacy, which has included support for German neo-Nazis and agreeing with a defense of Hitler’s actions in the Holocaust, among many other white supremacist statements. This has driven protests against the company, embarrassed owners and pushed many customers away. It shouldn’t have to be said that allying a company’s brand with neo-Nazis is a bad political decision, especially so if you, as an individual, are so tied to the brand. In fact, this is something that Tesla acknowledged very early in its existence, as the company used to make a very intentional effort not to make EVs political, hoping to be able to sell to as broad of an audience as possible. Musk seems to have forgotten that directive sometime during his ongoing twitter addiction (an addiction so bad that he has now overpaid for the company not once, but twice). But this isn’t the first time Tesla has had to call out its own CEO’s actions. As the Musk problem has continued to get worse, Tesla has said similar things multiple times in recent months. In March, Tesla’s policy team sent a letter to the US Trade Representative urging the USTR to “consider the downstream impacts” of proposed actions. One of those downstream impacts includes retaliatory tariffs, and given the high profile nature of the attachment between Tesla’s CEO and another social media addicted clown who’s implementing said tariffs, there was a lot of talk about Tesla becoming target of those tariffs. He can try to blame things like the tariffs - but fundamentally - Musk made bad business decisions from the Cybertruck design to the Robotaxi instead of a low cost EV. He has consistently gone against staff recommendations that were based upon a business case analysis. It's time for him to go. And sure enough, Tesla has seen other governments retaliate against it. Canada has removed Tesla from some incentive programs and is investigating Tesla’s sudden incentive cash grab. The UK, one of the few territories where Tesla sales are not down, has also considered removing the company from incentive programs. Tesla has also had to walk a thin line on EV incentives, stating that it supports killing EV incentives in the US because Musk said so (even though that would harm the company), while still lobbying for EV incentives overseas where the Musk/Trump stink isn’t overpowering the conversation. So, in the end, it seems like a really tough time to be a Tesla employee. The company knows that its CEO is harming it, but the board won’t do anything about it, and speaking up too forcefully can get you fired. Pour one out for the employees, we hope you’re holding it down well enough. Charge your electric vehicle at home using rooftop solar panels.

    "content": "Thousands of Britons have voiced opposition to a request by Tesla to supply electricity to British homes. And what’s the sole reason for this opposition? It’s because of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Last month, Tesla applied for a license to supply electricity to British homes. The application was sent to Ofgem, UK’s government energy regulator. In addition to Tesla’s business selling EVs, and its CEO’s business making promises about autonomy and robots that never materialize, Tesla is also in the business of selling energy products. The energy products include solar panels, after Tesla’s controversial acquisition of SolarCity, a company run by Musk’s cousin Lyndon Rive, in 2016. They also include Powerwalls, Tesla’s home battery backup system which can store energy from a home’s solar panels or from the grid, and then use it or sell it back to the grid later during peak hours when electricity is most expensive. But even more interestingly, Powerwalls can be hooked into a network, called a Virtual Power Plant or VPP, which allows thousands of batteries to simultaneously push energy to the grid when the grid needs it. This can help to end power outages and can also make a significant amount of money for homeowners who participate. A VPP can also help with overall grid stability. While a single battery doesn’t do much to help the entire grid, thousands of batteries all together can help to shave peaks and shift loads grid-wide, helping to enable the transition to renewable forms of energy generation like wind and solar, which can be intermittent due to weather, clouds, gusts of wind and so on. And the UK is doing quite well at renewable adoption – the island which started the industrial revolution because it’s literally built on a bed of coal just shut down its last coal plant last year. Clean electricity growth is strong, with over half of its electricity coming from renewables sources last year. And it has set even more ambitious goals going forward, targeting an 81% emissions cut by 2035. So, a VPP might be useful in a country with so much wind and solar. While Tesla’s application does not specify details of its plans (In accordance with UK law), it seems likely that the purpose behind the application would be to set up a VPP system in the UK. Tesla already runs VPPs in Texas and California. So, all sounds good, right? This is a useful product, and it can help the UK confront a challenge it will need to face as it transitions to a cleaner grid. And, at a time when electricity prices are going up worldwide, more competition and flexibility in energy markets can only be a good thing. The only problem? Everyone hates Elon Musk. A lot. As it turns out, Ofgem has been swamped with thousands of comments opposing Tesla’s plan, as a result of a campaign that says Musk shouldn’t be allowed to get anywhere near UK’s electricity supply. The campaign was launched by the group Best for Britain, which bills itself as “the researchers, data scientists, strategists, and activists, fixing the problems Britain faces after Brexit.” It set up an action campaign allowing Brits to send a letter to Ofgem stating their opposition to Tesla’s plan. The letter argues that Musk has proven, through his recent political activity, that he is not interested in the general wellbeing of the populace, but rather in “pushing his own agenda.” It accuses him of “dangerous incompetence or wilful neglect,” and says that these should be “disqualifying qualities for entrance into our energy markets.” For background, while Musk claimed to be working to reduce US government waste (when he actually increased the deficit), he in fact spent that time advising the US to defund entities investigating his unlawful actions. The letter also mentions the “rapid spread of misinformation, hatred and conspiracy theories in the UK and across the wider world” on twitter since Musk spent $44 billion to buy the company (that later dropped to a value closer to $15 billion – his recent purchase of it from himself notwithstanding). After Musk purchased the platform, hate speech has flourished there. None of the points made by the letter focus on Tesla’s business as a whole, but rather solely on its CEO’s harmful actions. As of yesterday, Best for Britain says 8,462 people had used it to contact Ofgem to voice their opposition to the plan. Public comment remains open until Friday, August 22. This is not the first time Tesla has received local opposition for business deals due to Musk’s poor public persona. In May, Australians voiced opposition to a plan to build a battery factory and Tesla showroom, where ~95% of comments opposed the plan (with some choice Australian language appearing in them). And just yesterday, the Austin American-Statesman reported opposition to Tesla’s tax breaks from residents of the county where its Texas Gigafactory is located. Separately, Musk has received pushback in the UK and elsewhere for his support for extreme rightwing and racist political figures, both in the US where he gave hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to a treasonous felon who tried to overthrow the US government, and in the UK where he has given both rhetorical and monetary support to a violent racist fraudster who has been imprisoned multiple times. His unambiguous Nazi salutes, agreeing with a defense of Hitler’s actions in the Holocaust, support for German neo-Nazis, and many other white supremacist statements didn’t help, either. Beyond his association with racist politics, he has also directly spread misinformation about climate change himself, despite this being a contradiction of Tesla’s mission. Musk has even said that his own recent actions are “not good for America or the world.” The result of these actions has been to drive protests against the company, embarrass owners and destroy Tesla’s brand reputation. Lol... what kind of corporate board rewards a CEO that COMPLETELY ALIENATED THE CORE CUSTOMER BASE with a $29 billion stock grant? 😂 In the UK specifically, Tesla sales have fallen by 60% year-over-year, according to the most recent July numbers. Tesla sales show similar trends in most territories in which the company sells, with Tesla sales down globally despite a rising global EV market. Nevertheless, despite Elon Musk demonstrably being the problem with Tesla right now, his friends and family on Tesla’s board recently gave him a ~$29 billion payout, claiming that it would “energize and focus” the company’s bad CEO. The 30% federal solar tax credit is ending this year. If you’ve ever considered going solar, now’s the time to act.

    "content": "Elon Musk implies that he’ll quit his part-time job as CEO of Tesla (TSLA) if he doesn’t get his $1 trillion pay package. On today’s episode of Quick Charge, I suggest GM’s Mary Barra should replace him, and explore some of the compelling EV deals out there looking to take a bite out of Elon’s market share. In addition to my take on what the TSLA board should or shouldn’t decide, we’ve got a pile of EV lease deals, some hot, upcoming new electric Jeep models, and a look at some of the ways the end of the Federal EV tax credit isn’t the end at all.

NVIDIA, a $4.5 trillion dollar company and the most valuable in the world, pays it's CEO Jensen Huang $50 million a year. Apple pays CEO Tim Cook $75 million a year. Like Elon could go anywhere else and even make a fraction of what he makes at Tesla. His other own companies don't have the market cap to offer him comparable stock options, nor would the private investors allow that kind of stock dilution to their investments. He literally can't go to any another company in the world and make more money even if Tesla only pays him 1/10th of what he wants.. He can rage quit out of spite but he can't make the obscene money he makes anywhere but at Tesla so he isn't going anywhere else unless he is forced out.

    "content": "In the past week, TSLA stock has increased by about one-third of its previous value. But this increase has had nothing to do with company performance, or even due to external factors like consumer tastes or beneficial changes in EV policy. Rather, the week’s speculation has come out of a simple desire to see Tesla become the benefit of government corruption. Government corruption is a problem in much of the world. Where there is power, there will be some who seek to abuse it. To be clear, while the word corruption gets tossed around a lot, it does still mean something. It happens when a person in some position of authority uses that authority to channel wealth not towards the general public good, but to either themselves or to friends of theirs. Advanced democracies like those in Europe and the US portray themselves as being beyond corruption, and in many ways the most obvious, base levels of corruption – like direct bribery of officers of the law – are not a common a occurrence in the cultures of these advanced democracies. But this does not mean there is no corruption in these societies, it’s just revealed in different ways, or hidden behind certain levels of gentility and tradition. Nations that score high on absence of corruption indices may have rid themselves of certain forms of direct bribery, but when Toyota speaks, Japan listens; or when new US exhaust rules are up for debate and polluters like Big Oil and Auto ask for more pollution, those exhaust rules get softened despite opposition from doctors, nurses, scientists, public interest groups, many businesses, and the general public. And then, of course, there are the various court-blessed forms of bribery and election tampering which, well, we’re going to see a couple examples of in a few moments. Though perhaps those customs of gentility are showing some cracks these days, as the US stock market has openly been rewarding Tesla’s stock price all week (until today, its first down day in a week), not due to any changes in company performance or even any beneficial changes in policy (in fact, prospective policy changes are likely damaging to Tesla’s mission and product categories, not helpful), but rather due to the stock market’s seemingly open desire to see Tesla benefit from direct government corruption. The market does have reason to think this, too. Convicted felon Donald Trump, the next man who will squat in the White House after finally winning more votes than his opponent on his third try (and after committing treason in 2021, for which there is a clear legal remedy), has displayed open corruption at many points in the past. This legacy of corruption is well-chronicled and easily seen by anyone who has paid any attention. That said, the scope of it, with over 3,700 conflicts of interest displayed during his first stint as pretender to the throne, might still surprise even those who have closely followed the ridiculousness of the man’s existence. Nevertheless, the CEO of the nation’s largest EV maker has attempted to pair up with the felon in question, pledging hundreds of millions of dollars he got from selling EVs to fund a candidate who promised to tank EVs if oil companies gave him a billion-dollar bribe. Musk, despite previously correctly acknowledging that “Climate change is real. Leaving [the Paris Agreement] is not good for America or the world,” has forgotten anything he might have known about climate change, and has buddied up to someone whose last occupation of the White House, and whose party’s recent actions, have been marked by several moves aimed towards poisoning Americans with more air and water pollution and saddling everyone with higher health and fuel costs. In addition Mr. Trump has shown total ignorance (well there’s a phrase you surely haven’t heard in the last microsecond) of everything related to EVs and EV-related policy, and his running-mate even wrote a bill to increase EV prices by $15,000 compared to polluting gas vehicles. Further, those in his orbit have indicated they want other changes that likely conflict with Tesla’s business model – for example, the first car dealer elected to the Senate wants to change car dealership rules, probably not in the benefit of Tesla, which has aligned itself directly against the car dealership model. This, at first glance, seems incongruous (also at the second glance. and several more after.) It’s strange that the stock market would react to a vote of confidence in a confidence-man who clearly intends to be bad for EVs… by rewarding a company whose stated mission is to accelerate the adoption of EVs. But wait! There is perhaps an explanation for this, and if you’ve been paying any amount of attention to the words above, I bet you know what it is. Indeed, the stock market has decided that the recent situationship between these two individuals – who both have such a void in their hearts that they’ve wasted billions of dollars of their (and other people’s) money on social media companies in order to feel loved – is somehow real and is going to flourish into a beautiful, corruption-laden baby in the form of Tesla somehow being uniquely advantaged by a close relationship with the federal government. What we’re talking about here is a public consensus that Tesla, the company whose market cap has spiked more than any other over the course of the past week, is going to uniquely benefit from corruption. That it will gain due to the personal relationship described above. That’s why TSLA went up so much in the past week. It’s not because the Cybercab is driving on well-mapped private roads like we already knew it can. It’s not because they’re having trouble selling Cybertrucks. It’s not because Tesla’s Mexican factory plans have been thrown into question. And it’s not because they’ll get 50 cents or whatever every time a Volvo charges at a Supercharger. It’s because TSLA buyers, in a country that has publicly prided itself on being a bastion of economic freedom, and from a party and campaign that has claimed for so long to support these ideals, think Mr. Trump and the republicans will do some good ol’ big-government corruption and they want to benefit from it. Some analysts have attempted to come up with any number of other urbane explanations to hide their cheerleading for this corruption, but Occam’s razor leads us to the obvious answer as to what’s happening here. We don’t actually know what sort of corruption could occur here to benefit Tesla, or what the market is anticipating. As mentioned above, the likely policy changes would all be bad for EVs and solar/energy, which are the two businesses Tesla makes its money in. Already today, a new EPA pick has been announced who has already signaled an intent to destroy the environmental and economic progress made under the current EPA. He has repeatedly attacked clean air over his legislative history. Some have theorized that a new government would end various legal actions against Tesla, and that this would benefit the company. However, the most significant legal actions against Tesla are not on the federal level, and are state-level actions or class actions, not ones led by the government. The federal government is currently undergoing no significant legal actions against Tesla, except typical safety-related NHTSA investigations which every automaker sees, and aren’t likely to result in sweeping changes for Tesla. And even if the White House did try to illegally intervene in non-federal actions (and, when you vote for a criminal, you can indeed expect him to do crime) – like the case over Musk’s illegal pay package – this specific one would help Tesla by saving the company from wasting $55 billion on a bad CEO. Even proposed tariff changes (especially when implemented by an ignoramus who clearly does not understand how they work, or more accurately, don’t work) are unlikely to benefit Tesla. There are already US tariffs on Chinese EVs, and domestic manufacturing provisions which we will cover below. Tesla has actually been negatively affected by these tariffs, as its cheapest Model 3 uses a Chinese-sourced battery. Musk has previously correctly noted that tariffs on Chinese EVs are likely unhelpful, though his position does seem to change day-by-day – which is surely the sign of someone with a good grasp on the issues. Some automakers oppose tariffs because of the fear of retaliatory counter-tariffs, as we recently saw from Germany. Even TSLA cheerleader Adam Jonas noted the “difficulty” in understanding how this potential closeness would benefit Tesla, in a note sent out yesterday. So, again, it is not clear what sort of corruption TSLA gamblers think the company would benefit from. But the message from the stock market is clear: that’s what it wants. All of this comes against a backdrop of the last 4 years of government policy that has benefitted Tesla greatly. Tesla originally started business in a heavily Democratic state, with support from that state’s regulations aimed towards putting zero emission vehicles on the road. The company applied for and earned early loans from President Obama’s Democratic federal government which helped it get started, and benefitted from Obama’s EPA finally harmonizing regulations with California, a smoother regulatory environment which Mr. Trump later torpedoed. It also received more benefit from the first round of federal tax credits than any other company. And the Biden-Harris administration has again greatly benefitted Tesla, by improving the federal tax credit which Tesla has again used more than any other automaker. It also benefits from the domestic sourcing provisions in this bill, as a US automaker. In addition, the EPA has made a number of positive actions in the last four years, which Tesla has lobbied for, and which Tesla will benefit from (in contrast to Mr. Trump’s actions, which Tesla lobbied against, and which harmed Tesla). Even the NACS transition was sparked by the Biden administration’s actions, because federal rules requiring intercompatibility as a qualification for receiving charging grants is what led Tesla to introduce the standard to begin with. The company will likely benefit from this, though recent chaos caused by the mercurial actions of its bad CEO have put a damper on that. Unlike investors’ apparent desires from the incoming regime, these actions were not corruptly targeted towards an individual company on the basis of personal gain or perceived friendship, but towards the public good. Tesla just happened to be the biggest company building a product that helps make transportation cleaner, and thus benefitted the most. So again, the whiplash here of a positive stock response to negative news is confusing, unless we explain it as corruption. Now, there are still reasons to think that this might not turn out as well as this week’s gamblers might think. After all, both individuals are known for their capriciousness, for turnover increasing the closer you get to them in their respective organizations, for those they’ve worked closely with speaking out against them, and for their habit of firing high-performers who deign to present ideas – no matter how reasonable – if those ideas happen to be in opposition to whatever each respective egomaniac’s current fixation is. Always a sign of a great leader if their closest team members keep quitting – and surely two “leaders” of that sort are even more likely to work well together… right? Tesla stock is a meme stock (mostly). DJT stock is completely a meme stock (almost no profit for a several billion dollar valuation). When are people going to learn that the corporations and individual billionaires are the ones winning and not the people? Mass deportation is coming in the US and groceries will get more expensive. So will menial labor. Tariffs are coming, and so the prices of goods are going to go up as well. This is not the solution for the American people who are hurting financially. It is the solution for the rich who can afford to invest extra money and ride the corporate success wagon. But whether it works out or not, let us call all of this exactly what it is: the stock market is actively, openly, betting on corruption (and not just with Tesla – this week, crypto markets have been going crazy, expecting that a scammer in the White House will benefit an asset class that exists solely to facilitate scams). It hopes for a handout, hopes for exemptions and carveouts, and hopes for “government to pick the winners and losers” (remember when the republican candidate made that statement, about Tesla specifically?). This is not a group of people that support properly working markets, competition, or any of the ideals they often profess. They certainly aren’t looking forward to better policy for the public good. They are instead expecting and advocating for corruption. It’s the kind of thing that’s more appropriate for a Banana Republic(an), not one of those aforementioned advanced democracies which we used to be able to consider ourselves one of.

    "content": "The McDermitt Caldera is an extinct supervolcano on the Oregon-Nevada border that, depending on who you believe, is loaded with enough lithium to power 600 million electric cars. It begs the question: who will control the $1.5 trillion dollar mineral deposit? Located at the southern end of the McDermitt Caldera, in Humboldt County, Nevada, the lithium (Li) deposit at Thacker Pass is believed to have estimated reserves of approximately 1.3 million tons of Li carbonate equivalent. That’s enough of the treasured material, on its own, to redraw world’s energy map. Recent calculations by Castor and Henry estimate an in situ tonnage of ~20 to 40 MT of Li (maximum 120 MT of Li) to be contained within sediments of the whole McDermitt caldera … even if this estimation is high due to variations in sediment thickness and/or Li grade, the Li inventory contained in McDermitt caldera sediments would still be on par with, if not considerably larger than, the 10.2 MT of Li inventory estimated to be contained in brines beneath the Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia, previously considered the largest Li deposit on Earth. Spanish-language site Motorpasión reports that the McDermitt Caldera deposit packs enough lithium to produce a staggering 600 million electric cars, and could make the US (with the right policies in place) a global leader in the li-ion battery supply chain. So, of course, America’s biggest EV oligarchs are going to fight over it. Pickup trucks are big business in the US and, frankly, everywhere else — and both Musk and Bezos are hoping to get into that business in a big way, through the Tesla CEO’s Cybertruck, its (supposedly) less polarizing successor, and the upcoming low-cost Slate backed by the Amazon founder. And that doesn’t include GM (who have been arguing over the rights to the caldera for years already), Ford, Rivian (where Bezos, through Amazon, holds more than 13% of the shareholders’ vote), and others. For both of them, controlling the caldera means more than money. It means securing control of one of the most strategic mineral sectors of this century. And, in late 2024 with the Trump-Musk bromance in full bloom, Musk publicly pushed mining operations to produce more nickel for EVs, invested in a massive lithium refinery in Texas, and promised even more EV production, making it look like Musk, through his political influence, might soon be granted control of the world’s largest lithium deposit. “Elon’s always been there, now the megaphone is bigger,” one lithium producer, who was granted anonymity to speak freely, told Politico. “This is a pretty small space, so he’s always had a lot of truck.” Then in June, the Trump-Musk bromance collapsed in dramatic fashion, with Musk launching a now-deleted tweet on X accusing the President of being “in the Epstein files,” launching a political controversy that is still gnawing at Trump. With Musk’s political influence largely spent as he starts his own America Party to “primary” sitting republicans who voted against his interests, that opens the door for others to start looking into American mineral rights — and Bezos, through his AI‑driven exploration startup KoBold Metals (which recently spent $1 billion to expand its footprint into the Democratic Republic of the Congo after inking a framework deal to buy AVZ Mineral’s stake in the Manono hard rock lithium deposit there), is perfectly placed to capitalize on that opportunity. And, if there’s one thing guys like Jeff Bezos do well, it’s capitalize on an opportunity … and I wouldn’t expect him to happily send all that lithium he’s mining to Elon’s refinery, either. This is how it's done, gang: a reader spotted some factual errors and reached out via email. Getting corrections shortly with an update to follow. 👍 What do you guys think?

    "content": "A new campaign is adding to the growing chorus of pushback against Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s absurdly large proposed $1 trillion pay package, this time led by unions and public interest groups. The campaign encourages individuals to get in contact with their pension or retirement funds and ask them to vote against Musk’s payday. In September, Tesla’s board proposed a stock award worth up to $1 trillion for CEO Elon Musk. It includes several milestones regarding Tesla stock and product performance, each of which unlocks tens of billions of dollars for Musk. It’s the largest award proposed for any CEO of any company by multiple orders of magnitude – with previous proposed Musk awards holding the second and third place positions as well. In addition to that much-reported proposal, another proposal is up for a vote which would create a special share reserve of 208 million shares (current value $92 billion) which the Tesla board can give to Elon Musk with no strings attached. Both proposals will be voted on by TSLA shareholders at Tesla’s shareholder meeting on November 6. Many groups have chimed in to raise the alarm about these proposals and how they’re bad for Tesla shareholders. Most recently, the two largest advisory groups, ISS and Glass Lewis, recommended that shareholders vote against. Earlier, a group of public pension funds including the comptrollers of several US states, the American Federation of Teachers, and a Swedish insurance group. Tesla has lashed out with attacks on each of these groups after their dispassionate analysis of the proposals’ flaws. We at Electrek also did a deep dive into the proposals, with background and details on the proposals and how they’re bad for employees and shareholders, which you can read here: Elon Musk’s $1 trillion stock award gets more ridiculous the more you look into it Now a new group has joined the chorus, calling itself “Take Back Tesla.” It’s led by unions, encouraging individuals with pension or retirement funds to get in touch with the controllers of those funds and ask them to vote no on Musk’s pay package. Take Back Tesla consists of the American Federation of Teachers (who signed the previous pension fund letter) and the Communication Workers of America, who represent around 2.5 million workers combined. Several public interest groups have joined on, including Public Citizen, Stop the Money Pipeline, Americans for Financial Reform, Ekō, and People’s Action Institute. These groups are generally focused on reducing the power of corporations in politics, reducing wealth concentration, and opposing the corrupting and polluting power of the fossil fuel industry. The groups bring up some of the same points that have been brought up before, but are more focused on public advocacy and Musk’s recent political actions, in addition to protecting value for the common shareholder. Rather than talking about dilution (which the proposals will increase, removing rights and value from shareholders), Take Back Tesla focuses more on the inequity involved in the plan. It points out that the proposed pay package for Musk tops out at a Tesla market cap of $8.5 trillion, about 2x the current market cap of the most valuable company on Earth, NVIDIA. However, Musk would be paid 2,000x as much as NVIDIA’s CEO Jensen Huang, who made $50 million last year. It also asserts that a Tesla employee making the median Tesla salary would need to work 1.7 million years to match a single year of Musk’s yearly compensation under the plan (we checked the salary numbers, and it seems Take Back Tesla might be using a low estimate or not counting stock-based compensation – but that doesn’t change the point too much, especially since Tesla just drained its employee stock reserve to give it all to Elon Musk). The groups are also particularly interested in the effects that Musk himself has had on employees around the country. AFT president Randi Weingarten said: The Tesla board, instead of upholding basic governance standards, wants to green light an outrageous $1 trillion pay package for a CEO who has spent most of the year engaged in childish political brawls, rather than working to create shareholder value. To reward this destructive behavior with an obscene salary is a slap in the face—not only to the federal workers he’s fired, but to the retirees whose pensions are invested in Tesla stock. We urge shareholders to join with us and demand their state pension officials reject Musk’s money grab and confiscate the Tesla board’s rubber stamp. The reason Take Back Tesla is interested in pension funds is because, beyond individual Tesla shareholders, many people in the US are invested in TSLA via their 401(k) or IRA. Since TSLA is one of the largest companies on the market, almost every fund will hold some exposure to it. Which means that this issue isn’t just of interest to those who directly hold TSLA shares, but to almost everyone with any exposure to the stock market – all of whom would be better off with more stable leadership at the top of one of the largest companies in America. It could seem strange that groups looking to stop the fossil fuel industry would target Elon Musk, CEO of the largest American electric car company. But Musk has recently proven himself to be one of the fossil fuel industry’s greatest political allies. Musk gave $288M, more money than any individual, to a political effort which strives to harm EVs, and the group he donated that money to has put significant effort into increasing oil use, subsidizing gas cars and destroying the climate, not just in the US but abroad. This has caused great harm to the US EV industry, but Musk has continued to offer rhetorical and monetary support regardless. In addition, during his time cosplaying as an unofficial government advisor, Musk recommended the firing of hundreds of thousands of government employees, working to balloon the government deficit by making it less able to do its job. This is particularly of interest to the unions involved in this effort, who protect the interests of the very same public employees Musk targeted. Take Back Tesla urges institutional shareholders to “oppose excessive CEO compensation and demand that any proposed pay package for Musk be reasonable and rationally benchmarked to the compensation of CEOs at other similarly sized companies.” The groups also oppose “the election of any Tesla Board of Directors members who do not demonstrate appropriate independence from the CEO and adherence to corporate governance best practices.” For more information and to sign a petition which will be delivered to fund managers, visit takebacktesla.com.

    "content": "The two largest independent advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, have both recommended a “no” vote on the proposed pay package for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, citing many concerns about shareholder dilution and other terms of the plan. In September, Tesla’s board proposed a stock award worth up to $1 trillion for CEO Elon Musk. It includes several milestones regarding Tesla stock and product performance, each of which unlocks tens of billions of dollars for Musk. It’s the largest award proposed for any CEO of any company by multiple orders of magnitude – with previous proposed Musk awards holding the second and third place positions as well. In addition to that much-reported proposal, another proposal is up for a vote which would create a special share reserve of 208 million shares (current value $92 billion) which the Tesla board can give to Elon Musk with no strings attached. Both proposals will be voted on by TSLA shareholders at Tesla’s shareholder meeting on November 6. There are a lot of details and history behind this proposal which we at Electrek have covered extensively. Most recently, I went over most of the details of the stock award in this article: Elon Musk’s $1 trillion stock award gets more ridiculous the more you look into it. But now, both of the largest independent advisory companies have chimed in to point out concerns about the proposals in front of shareholders. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis are “proxy advisory” companies, both of which who do research and analysis of company proposals and then make recommendations to shareholders about how to vote for them. Company boards often have their own recommendation on an issue, which may or may not be the best for shareholders – especially if those boards are lacking in independence, and may make recommendations that favor management personally over shareholders as a whole. So, it’s important for independent outside advisors to have a look at proposals and give their take. Proxy advisory firms are generally less interested in the specifics of what industry a company is in, and just want to ensure good corporate governance – independent and diverse boards, appropriate executive compensation, and so on. These recommendations are often followed by institutional investors – banks and other large companies that hold large chunks of shares in many companies, many of which they won’t track deeply. So they hire advisory firms to help them make decisions on votes. ISS and Glass Lewis combined make up the vast majority of the proxy advisory market, so when they make recommendations, it can sway a lot of votes. And, in looking at the proposals in front of Tesla investors for this year’s shareholder meeting, both of them have stated significant concerns. On Friday, ISS stated that while it recognizes Musk’s “track record and vision” and the board’s intent to retain him for those reasons, the pay package “locks in extraordinarily high pay opportunities over the next ten years” and “reduces the board’s ability to meaningfully adjust future pay levels.” It also pointed out that the proposal is designed in such a way as to allow extremely high pay for Musk even if most milestones aren’t achieved, and stated that its “astronomical” size would dilute shareholder value and voting rights. Today, Glass Lewis echoed ISS’ statement, saying that dilution to shareholders “warrants significant concern.” It recommended shareholders to vote against all three pay-related proposals (2, 3 and 4), and to vote against re-election of board members Ira Ehrenpreis and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, though it did recommend voting for the re-election of Joseph Gebbia. Electrek obtained a full copy of Glass Lewis’ report, but not of ISS’. Glass Lewis calls proposal 3 “particularly concerning,” as it ties a 208 million share award for Musk to the creation of a pool of 60 million shares for all other Tesla employees combined, and notes that the employee pool is only necessitated by the board’s previous action draining the pool of shares for employees and giving them all to Musk. It suggests that shareholders vote down this proposal, and that the company put up a separate, clean proposal to refill the employee pool. And proposal 4, the $1 trillion award, is noted as being excessively dilutive for current shareholders and allowing too much concentration of ownership into Musk’s hands, along with producing more “key man risk” for Tesla. Glass Lewis states that attaching Tesla’s future so inextricably with Musk’s is risky, given his “vast and varied interests,” and suggests it would be reasonable to “sets parameters that limit the key man risk to which shareholders are exposed,” which the company has chosen not to do. It also notes concern over promising billions of dollars of awards to Musk for doing some of the most basic things that a CEO is meant to do, such as developing a succession plan. Shareholders should “reasonably be concerned that the committee feels the need to compel Mr. Musk to perform such duties, particularly at such cost to shareholders.” The milestones involved in the award are noted as potentially being easy to achieve, particularly given that the board can decide on a whim to grant a tranche of stock even if a product milestone isn’t reached, if market realities have changed between now and then (a “covered event”) resulting in those product milestones becoming unrealistic. The board is given significant discretion in this matter. Finally, Glass Lewis points out the danger of allowing Musk to vote his entire ownership stake in favor of his own pay, which was not the case in the last shareholder vote over Musk’s pay. This means essentially a free 15% head-start on the vote, due purely to Musk’s own shares. Glass Lewis cites surveys of its clients and others, stating that a majority of both shareholders and non-investors think that executives should not be able to vote on their own pay packages in stating that Musk’s ability to vote on this proposal does not align with market expectations. Glass Lewis also stated its concerns with a proposal for Tesla to invest in xAI. xAI is a private company which Musk started started to compete with Tesla (and is currently subject to a lawsuit for that reason). Glass Lewis said that this matter should be decided by the board, not shareholders. In sum, Glass Lewis’ recommendations ran counter to the Tesla’s board recommendation in almost every case. The only proposals they agreed on are the election of Gebbia, ratification of Tesla’s auditor, and proposals 8 and 9, two shareholder proposals recommending Tesla adopt standards on sustainability and child labor. Tesla has, expectedly, responded with attacks against both firms. Both ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended “no” votes on Musk’s pay packages in the past, citing similar concerns over their size and the amount of dilution which they would cause to shareholders. And Tesla has spoken out against the two firms in those instances. In this instance, Tesla attacked ISS, suggesting that its status as a disinterested advisor (which does not hold shares in the company) somehow makes it less capable of seeing the reality of the situation. It also notes past shareholder votes on other proposals, which were different from the proposals on the table today. Musk also repeatedly called ISS “terrorists” for their objective analysis of his pay package. And after Glass Lewis’ recommendation today, Tesla levied another attack, making similar points about votes on past proposals, rather than the proposals in front of shareholders today. Separately, Tesla also attacked a group of pension funds which are invested in TSLA, mocking them for having returns of 7-13% (which, collectively, is above average for large stable funds). Tesla even hired an outside PR company to publicize this attack. We’ve been clear here, over and over, about how ridiculous this stock plan is. However, despite it seeming ridiculous at first glance, it only gets more ridiculous the deeper you look into it. I went over it all this weekend in the article mentioned above, Elon Musk’s $1 trillion stock award gets more ridiculous the more you look into it. It’s long, but if you want more detail, that’s the place to go. In short, the analyses presented by these outside firms looking at Tesla’s shareholder proposals, and the environment around them, are clear-headed and made in the interest of Tesla shareholders. If shareholders actually read the letters or analyses involved with their own interests in mind, they will likely be persuaded. Meanwhile, Tesla’s responses have been filled with the sort of language that someone would expect out of an entity that is trying to deceive – the sort of language we’ve gotten used to in our politics. They read as campaign messages or advertising efforts, not as the result of deep analysis. And Musk also threatened his own company just yesterday, once again, in the hope that shareholders will feel trapped enough that they vote to retain him. If the only place people read about this is on twitter, which Elon Musk bought for the purpose of spreading his own propaganda and shutting down dissent (including using bots to do so), they might get one sense of what the proposals mean. In that upside-down world, TSLA investors can only benefit as the stock goes up, and Musk only benefits if the stock goes up. I am a Tesla owner. Due to Musk's political contributions to push our democracy towards fascism, of which a portion of my purchase funded, I will not be buying another Tesla. If Musk divests from Tesla because he didn't get his Trillion $$$, then I will continue being a loyal Tesla customer. Tesla investors need to determine what percentage of Tesla owners out there feel the same way. Declining global sales certainly provides a clue. But looking into the actual details of the proposals, it becomes apparent that Musk can get awarded with a larger payday than any CEO ever for doing nothing at all, that that award comes at the cost of every other Tesla employee and the voting rights of every Tesla shareholder, and that better options are available which would maintain the rights of Tesla investors while also compensating its CEO (whose performance has been exceptionally bad recently). But those options have not been provided to shareholders to vote on, as Tesla’s board is working more in the benefit of their friend Elon, rather than the benefit of TSLA shareholders as a whole.

    "content": "Tesla sales in Europe are continuing to decline rapidly, and it appears the pain is just beginning for the automaker. The numbers for July are coming in from Europe and Tesla registrations are down 41.6% despite EV sales surging across the old continent. It shows that the free-fall decline in sales that we saw in the first half of 2025 is still continuing into the second half, despite Tesla falsely claiming that the issue in the first quarter was the Model Y changeover limiting supply. In fact, the decline appears to be accelerating in most European markets. Year-to-date (Jan-July), Tesla’s sales are down 34.3% throughout Europe: Tesla’s sales in Europe had already declined by about 10% or 40,000 units between 2023 and 2024. However, the decline is clearly accelerating in 2025. While the American automaker is down 34% in the entire European market, there are large specific European markets, like Germany and France, where the decline is even steeper. Just a few years ago, Tesla was selling more than 60,000 vehicles per year in Germany. Now, it appears that Tesla may face challenges in selling 20,000 units in the market this year. The UK was the most significant European market where Tesla’s decline was not too steep in the first half of the year, but it has now clearly accelerated. Tesla’s UK sales were down 60% in July 2025 compared to July 2024. The genuine concern for Tesla is that this is happening amid EV sales still surging in Europe. A few years ago, Tesla was the market leader and even had a majority of EV shares in Europe. The EV market is now doing better than ever in Europe, and the biggest electric automaker is seeing a sharp decline. This should tell you that something is really wrong at Tesla. CEO Elon Musk seems completely unbothered as he claims to believe that Tesla’s sales will surge back up in Europe once supervised self-driving is allowed. One request for Electrek. The percent change charts are all well and good, but could you put a chart on these articles with absolute numbers as well? If I'm following the arithmetic in the article correctly, Tesla's Europe sales are trending from ~400k in 2024 to ~265k in 2025. That's MASSIVE if I'm doing the arithmetic correctly. They'll have to start writing down the value of the Berlin factory pretty soon if this trend continues. Although that assumes adherence to accounting standards that Tesla seems to sometimes treat as optional. I believe Tesla’s primary challenge in Europe is competition. The only market Tesla is doing OK in right now is the US, and that’s because it’s the least competitive market for electric vehicles. In Europe, there are more EVs available from legacy automakers, and Chinese EVs are also starting to trickle in with lower tariffs than in the US. Tesla is having difficulties competing with those, especially since more than half the population dislikes the brand due to its CEO. It appears that there’s nothing currently stopping Tesla’s decline in Europe. It could get a lot worse before it gets better. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

    "content": "Little is known about super-secretive EV startup Slate, but the fledgling brand is rumored to be backed by Jeff Bezos and determined to shake up the existing electric order with an affordable lineup of compact SUVs and pickups with that golden $25,000 price tag. Now, at least, we know what it’s gonna look like. The battle of the billionaires is on! Redditor jonjopop over at the spotted subreddit spotted what looks like an early prototype of an unbranded SUV with bizarre “CryShare” wrap. CryShare, as a concept, seems to combine the functionality of a ride sharing app like Uber or Lyft with the familiar (to parent, anyway) idea that small babies will often sleep better in a moving car than in their own cribs … but that’s not what’s important here. Instead, focus on the vehicle itself – parked on Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Los Angeles without explanation or fanfare, this is our best look yet at the kind of vehicle(s) Slate is likely to reveal in the coming days. Other local automotive journalists caught wind of the public unveiling, too – and our friends at The Autopian (Hi, Matt!) sent their own David Tracy out on the streets of LA to check it out. Tracy took the following video and posted it to Instagram. A post shared by The Autopian (@theautopian) The Slate breaking cover and causing buzz just ahead of what’s sure to be a painful Q1 earnings call for Tesla is a masterstroke of marketing – especially as doubts surrounding the viability of a “less expensive” Tesla Model Y or Model 3 continue to mount amid the uncertainty of Trump’s tariffs and declining sales of the brand’s more profitable models both at home and abroad. How does it feel dancing like a puppet to the whims and moods of these laughably wealthy, wildly undertaxed oligarchs? These robber barons might be in a good mood one day and give you an affordable EV. But, the mood will turn and they'll end up laughing on stage swinging a chainsaw while cutting tens of thousands of worker's jobs. Good times! As with so much involving Slate, however, there is nothing here written in stone – or even cast in cheese. Nothing has been announced, nothing is promised, and for all we know this might have more to do with the affordable Rivian brand launch, a new BYD, or be a viral marketing bit from some local Art Center design student in (relatively) nearby Pasadena. In fact, about the only thing I think we can say about Bezos (?) new Slate project with confidence today is this: Elon could probably use that drink. SOURCES | IMAGES: Reddit, The Autopian.

    "content": "Republicans announced a new tax plan today and it’s just about as bad for America as expected, taking money for healthcare, clean air and energy efficiency from American families and sending it to the ultra-wealthy instead. You might think that this helps one of those ultra-wealthy, Elon Musk, who gave hundreds of millions of dollars to ani-EV candidates to help make this happen. But the main source of his wealth, Tesla, will be specifically harmed by rescission of EV credits – and its competitors largely won’t be. Now that the republican party has unveiled its job-killing tax proposal, we know a little more about what’s in it. Originally, it was thought by many that the proposal would completely kill all federal EV credits, with some estimating that the $7,500 credit would go away immediately (personally, I never thought it would be that stupid, but you never know with the republicans). But it’s clear they want to destroy the credit and make cars more expensive for Americans. After all, Donald Trump, while running for an office he remains Constitutionally barred from holding, asked oil companies for a billion-dollar bribe in exchange for ending the EV credit, a promise he has continued to say he will uphold as he squats in the aforementioned office. And last week, House Speaker Mike Johnson said that the House is likely to end the credit. It turns out the details are a little more nuanced than that, and that while the credit is ending, it will sunset a little later than many feared. It’s likely that the credit will last through the end of this year – which makes sense, since that’s how tax changes often work. Then, at the end of the year, Inflation Reduction Act credits will largely disappear. However, in the current draft of the bill, some automakers will retain access to some EV credits, for a time. This is due to an exception given for manufacturers who have not sold 200,000 vehicles between 2009 and 2025, a similar cap to the old EV tax credit that was first implemented in 2008, before Congress improved it and removed the cap in the Inflation Reduction Act. So, smaller manufacturers will continue to have some support, while large manufacturers who have already sold plenty of cars will lose all of their credits. A number of manufacturers have already reached the 200k EV cap, including Nissan, Ford, Toyota, Hyundai/Kia, GM, and of course, Tesla. Those manufacturers will lose access to credits. But others who started late or have more niche offerings continue to be under the 200k cap. These include companies like Mercedes, Honda, Lucid, Mazda and Subaru. Specifically, Rivian has been identified as one of the possible winners here, as the company has not yet sold 200,000 vehicles, though should be crossing that line sometime in the next couple years. And finally, the real competition for Tesla, gas cars, will not lose anything from the rescission of EV credits. Those cars will continue selling, they’ll just have a $7,500 advantage relative to today – on top of their advantage of each gas car being allowed to choke the world with $20,000+ in unpaid pollution costs, which show up on everyone’s hospital bills and health insurance premiums. So that brings up an interesting point: when Tesla and its bad CEO Elon Musk threw their support behind all of this, what did they think they would get out of it? After all, Tesla wrongly said, at the behest of Musk and his tortured logic, that ending EV credits would somehow help it. We called out that obvious incorrect statement at the time, saying that No, for crying out loud, killing EV subsidies will not help an EV company. But now it turns out that the situation is even worse for Tesla, because not only does Tesla’s gas competition get to keep the credits, but many electric competitors will get to keep them for some time as well. And don’t forget that this last quarter, government incentives were the only thing keeping Tesla from losing money. A regulatory environment that is more hostile to Tesla could turn black to red on the balance sheet, along with dropping sales and negative brand perception. Thank the bad CEO you voted to give $55B to for that loss, shareholders. But the oil companies, another competitor for Tesla, will continue to benefit from roughly $760 billion in subsidy per year in the US alone, in terms of the health and environmental costs they impose on society and do not pay for. If that subsidy was ended alongside the $7,500 EV credit, then EVs would indeed come out on top. But instead of ending those massive subsidies to fossil fuels, republicans have proposed to increase them, by cutting down enforcement and loosening pollution limits, both through this tax bill and through other agency actions and proposals. Further, the tax proposal unveiled today sunsets credits for many other products that Tesla sells. There are solar and home energy efficiency credits which Tesla takes advantage of through its Energy division, which sells solar and home battery systems to homeowners. These can be worth tens of thousands of dollars per installation, and those will go away if this proposal goes through. So in the end, Tesla loses access to credits both on its cars and its Energy division, while its competitors get an even more beneficial regulatory environment to continue polluting. And even its electric competitors get a temporary leg up for the time being. Meanwhile, Elon Musk gets his part of the $4.5 trillion in tax cuts that go directly to wealthy elites. So at least his pocketbook will look slightly better for a time, even though the company that has been responsible for filling it it will fall further due to less attractive product pricing and through his own association, which has driven protests against the company, embarrassed owners and pushed many customers away. He made is money off the carbon credits and now is moved on to other ways to make money and probably wants to close that door for others. So, to those of you who wanted us to “trust the plan” – how, exactly, is this beneficial to Tesla, again? Among the proposed cuts is the rooftop solar credit. That means you could have only until the end of this year to install rooftop solar on your home, before republicans raise the cost of doing so by an average of ~$10,000. So if you want to go solar, get started now, because these things take time and the system needs to be active before you file for the credit.

    "content": "An investor group representing several large public pension funds has sent a letter urging Tesla shareholders to vote down Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s trillion-dollar pay package, and to replace all of the board members up for re-election, detailing its concerns about Tesla’s corporate governance and risk to long-term shareholder value. Tesla’s board recently announced a proposal for an eye-wateringly large pay package for its part-time CEO, Elon Musk. The package would be worth up to $1 trillion in stock, assuming various performance metrics are met, which are attached to the company’s stock rising significantly in value. It would be the largest pay package ever given to any CEO in history, by multiple orders of magnitude. The new proposal comes after a previous proposal to give Musk a $55 billion pay package, which was ruled illegal after the board misled shareholders and was ruled to be too closely tied to Musk. Tesla then put that same pay package up to another vote, using the same dishonest tactics, where it passed (by a relatively narrow margin, as far as board-recommended shareholder proposals go). Unsurprisingly, given that the same Elon-tied board engaged in the same misleading behavior as it had before, the pay package was again voided, saving Tesla shareholders $55 billion. But the story has continued. Tesla’s board moved in August to give Musk $26 billion, which would still be the largest pay package for any CEO in history. It’s also not far off from the total amount of profits Tesla has ever made over its entire lifetime (Tesla’s quarterly profits have been dropping for the last couple years, under Musk’s leadership). All Musk has to do to get the money is remain CEO for two years – with no requirement not to remain distracted with his other private companies which he has shown favoritism to or been distracted by. Musk says he wants the shares so he can have greater control over the company (after selling off much of that control to buy twitter) and defend himself from investors who would seek to replace him with a good CEO, but wants “not so much control that he can’t be thrown out if he goes crazy” (which he already has). The $26 billion award is different than the previous shareholder proposal, as the move won’t allow a shareholder vote, and can only be opposed by an investor holding a minimum of 3% of Tesla’s stock (or more than $4 billion dollars worth). This minimum is due to an undemocratic law passed by Texas, the state where Tesla moved its corporate headquarters to after famously pro-corporation Delaware applied the law to its previous illegal pay proposal. But the largest pay package ever in history does not seem to be enough for Musk and his captured board, and they’re now seeking $1 trillion. However, a large investor group, several members of which opposed the previous pay package, has come out against this one as well – and has asked investors to replace the Tesla board while they’re at it. A group representing several large pension funds sent a letter to Tesla investors today, detailing the problems it has with Tesla’s corporate governance. It recommends that shareholders vote against the reelection of Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia, and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, and vote against Proposals 3 and 4, which are both related to the $1 trillion award for Musk. The letter is signed by SOC Investment Group, Friends Fiduciary Corporation, SHARE, several state treasurers (CO, CT, MA, MD, NM, NV, VT), the New York City Comptroller, the American Federation of Teachers, and Afa Försäkring, a Swedish insurance group. These entities for the most part hold long-term funds (for retirement and the like) which are interested in stable corporate performance, rather than volatility. It points out Tesla’s declining performance over the last few years, with dropping sales and profits and high stock volatility. It says that the company is losing ground on EVs compared to competitors which have rapidly brought new models to market, while Tesla has not. It points out that even in the areas where Musk claims Tesla will be a leader, robotics and driverless taxis, it has not shown that it has a lead over competitors. The group blames this poor performance on a captured board. It points out that companies with independent boards perform better, and that Tesla’s board has deep personal ties to Musk, and thus cannot challenge him when he takes detrimental actions for the company. Two board members are current or former Tesla executives, four are friends or family of the CEO, and four have been tenured on the board for 10 years or more. And the board as a whole is highly paid, which threatens impartiality (and was subject to a lawsuit). Tesla’s board chair Robyn Denholm has been paid nearly 200 times as much as the average S&P 500 director. Further, the board has allowed Musk to be distracted with other companies and government misadventures, while overpaying him despite his lack of focus on the company. While these pay packages have been marketed in a way to claim that they will “energize and focus” Musk, there is a history of Musk channeling resources from Tesla, a public company where he should be beholden to the board and shareholders, to his own private companies, which the board has done nothing to stop. While only three directors are up for reelection, the investment group urges shareholders to vote down each of them. It notes that Ehrenpreis is a close friend of Musk, Wilson-Thompson has hundreds of millions of dollars in shares (and has been selling them rapidly while telling employees not to) and was the sole decider in the original proposal of Musk’s illegal $55b pay package, and Gebbia has noted personal conflicts of interest before. But beyond personal difficulties with each of these three directors, the group says that it is crucial to Tesla’s governance to replace as much of the board as possible, so that the process of overhauling Tesla’s poor governance can start. In discussing other specific proposals, the letter says that Proposal 3, which creates a pool of shares to be given to Musk and other employees, was only made necessary by the board’s improper award of stock to Musk in the $26 billion pay package. Further, combining proposals to create a pool of shares for Musk and for employees disallows shareholders from voting for the employee pool independent of the Musk pool. It takes issue with the way these shares are offered to Musk, which could have tax costs for Tesla shareholders, and suggests that if Musk wants more control, he could just buy shares (which he recently did). And on Proposal 4, the $1 trillion stock incentive, the letter states that the unprecedented nature of this payday is not matched by similarly unprecedented targets. It states that the performance targets are “vague” and “undemanding,” and “subject to significant discretion by what we believe is a non-independent Board.” It goes over each of the widely-reported performance targets, relating to vehicle sales, FSD subscriptions, delivery of “bots,” and operation of robotaxis, and describes how each of those targets could be weaseled out of in the way they are worded, and says that it lacks confidence that the board will demand real achievement of those targets. Even if other targets related to Tesla’s market capitalization are met, the letter points out that granting so much stock to Musk would dilute other shareholders, and that TSLA’s high volatility means that large price swings might result in equity awards for Musk which do not result from stable increases in shareholder value. Along with this dilution comes an “erosion of rights” for shareholders at Tesla. The move from Delaware to Texas removed some voting rights from shareholders, and the board has historically required supermajority shareholder votes for changes in corporate governance. While a proposal exists to remove supermajority requirements this year, the board has not recommended a vote on it. The letter concludes by stating that voting against these proposals is incredibly important, and could be the last time Tesla shareholders have meaningful say over the company. As Musk’s ownership percentage has fallen while he’s sold off stock for his various misadventures, this has opened up the possibility of shareholders voting in their own interests for once, rather than in Musk’s. The company itself has stated that the goal of these proposals is to ensure Musk has more control over the company, and then asks shareholders to give up their own control for a CEO who has proven to make poor decisions. We covered the last time an investment group with many of the same members called for a vote against Musk’s $55 billion pay package, and we agreed with that letter then, as we agree with this letter now. Unfortunately, shareholders made the wrong decision last time, but there’s still a chance to wake up now, despite that Musk has decided to temporarily focus all of his media efforts shilling for his trillion dollars. Putting aside the many ancillary issues of how Musk has behaved publicly in ways that oppose Tesla’s mission for the last few years (which has been bad for Tesla, both reputationally and politically), on a strictly corporate level, Musk has been a bad CEO. The company has falling sales in most markets, even as EV sales rise rapidly. Tesla might have been able to keep up if it had new models, but its only new model in 5 years is a flop. Musk cancelled the all-important $25k Tesla project, only to focus on robotaxis that don’t work after more than a decade of promises. He’s spent his time at other companies, and even channeled resources from public shareholders at Tesla to his own private hands. And he fired many of Tesla’s best-performers on an ego trip, causing chaos for the industry. We could (and do) go on and on about his poor leadership and how Tesla would do better with another CEO who doesn’t threaten the company and spew lies, and we hope that the ridiculous numbers attached to this stock award might make shareholders realize what a goofy idea it is to give a bad CEO so much money. We’ve also seen the ridiculous ads that Tesla keeps putting out, on a daily basis, shilling for shareholders to vote against their own interests. Yesterday, the company suggested that if Musk doesn’t get his trillion dollars in stock, Tesla employees won’t be able to afford houses. The whole thing is just stupid. But why are we at Electrek interested in this shareholder vote? Because we, as a publication that advocates for EVs and wants all the clean air and efficiency benefits that come along with them, want a strong EV industry (and, as lung-havers who live on this planet, you should too). And Tesla, which has for some time been at the forefront at that industry, needs to be strong in order to keep the industry strong. I completely agree with the investor's goals; the board does need to be independent and no CEO is worth $1T, especially not Musk with the way he's been not doing his job. [I'd go so as to say that the BoD should have a requirement that if a person is the CEO of Tesla that person can not be the CEO of any other company, public or private.] The letter is a good idea. However, a better idea is for the investors to recognize that Tesla is not a normal company nor is the stock normal, and to recognize that as long as Musk is in control of of the company with its puppeteer board that it's not going to be stable and based on solid financial principles like they want. Their better option would be start selling their stock and buy something else that better fits with their goals and leave the Tesla mess behind. If they want a car company in their portfolio, perhaps use the money to go buy BYD stock. Tesla drove innovation in EVs early on, but is no longer at the forefront. It could be again, if it had better leadership. And the first step at solving that problem is reining in the excesses of the leader who is currently running the company into the ground and harming the industry as he does so. Voting against this pay package, and against the captured board that has enabled this sort of behavior, is a concrete step that any Tesla shareholder can take to improve not just Tesla’s corporate governance, but the EV industry and, indeed, the future of the world’s transition towards sustainable transport.

    "content": "Elon Musk needs Tesla investors to vote for his $1 trillion payday so that he can control a robot army. Yes, really, that’s what he said. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is no stranger to unrealistic proclamations, but today’s is a doozie. In the midst of an upcoming shareholder vote to give Musk a $1 trillion payday despite his recent poor performance as a CEO (with operating income down 40% during what should have been a record quarter), Tesla has been undergoing a media blitz trying to get shareholders to vote in favor of a plan to dilute their value and voting rights and saddle the company with the same CEO for the next decade. For his part, Musk has stated repeatedly that he wants this award not for money, but for more control over the company, because he “doesn’t feel comfortable” building AI unless he has more control over it (in keeping with this mentality, Musk started his own private AI company, xAI, to compete with Tesla, which is likely illegal). Nevermind that there are better options available which would increase his voting control without diluting all other shareholders, and nevermind that the reason he has less control of Tesla than he used to is because he sold TSLA shares to overpay billions of dollars for a social media platform he’s hopelessly addicted to, and then turned into a white supremacist haven. But this has at least been Musk’s story: he wants more control over AI development, and he needs more shares to do that. He thinks that his current ownership percentage of ~13% isn’t enough, and that ~25% is more comfortable. He hasn’t, however, mentioned the reason he wants that control. Today he did, and it’s because he wants to control a “robot army.” On Tesla’s Q3 conference call, Musk went on a tangent with his real thoughts on Optimus, Tesla’s (oft-remote-controlled) humanoid robot, in response to a shareholder question about the challenges of bringing Optimus to market. Here’s the way he ended that answer: My fundamental concern with regard to how much money and control I have at Tesla is if I go ahead and build this enormous robot army, can I just be ousted at some point in the future? Um, that’s my biggest concern, that is really the only thing Im trying to address with this… what’s called compensation but it’s not like I’m gonna go spend the money, it’s just if we build this robot army do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army? Not control but a strong influence. -Elon Musk, Tesla Q3 shareholder conference call, October 22, 2025 It’s apparent that he was trying to step back his comments mid-thought there, changing out the word “control” for “strong influence,” and the phrase “I go ahead and build” to “we build.” (I would suggest that perhaps the initial wordings used are more indicative of his true feelings on the matter than the ones he later changed to as his PR brain kicked in through the ketamine fog.) This is significantly different than past statements on this issue. Musk has often publicly stated his concern with AI, calling it a “risk” and “threat” to humanity, and said that he wants to be involved in its development to ensure safety. However, this statement had no mention of that. The discussion wasn’t about the safety of AI, but rather about wanting to control a robot army. And much of the statement was in the first person: he, alone, wants to “control” that robot army that he “builds.” Notably, also, it is very important that any controller of any army be able to be ousted. This is fundamental to the entire concept of modern governance and democracy, and when it doesn’t happen like that, countries tend to have problems. And, generally, the threshold for whether to remove someone from control of an army is not that you allow them to have 25% of the vote – usually, they get the same vote as everyone else (about 0.0000006%, in an American election these days). Let us put aside for the moment that, so far, Tesla’s Optimus robots have not yet shown the capabilities that would strike fear in the hearts of a fighting force. At one of Tesla’s big unveil events, it’s clear that the robots were teleoperated. Since then, we’ve seen robots fail to deliver popcorn. However, a recent video did show Optimus doing some pretty impressive kung-fu moves… but a later video of the robot doing the same routine at the opening of the new Tron movie suggests that much of the choreography was scripted. Regardless of that, and assuming the robots do improve rapidly enough to be a real threat to humanity, it is questionable that Musk’s fantasy involves him controlling a robot army that he in the past has said would number in the billions. The prospect of Elon Musk controlling a robot army might be of some concern considering Musk’s recent political advocacy, which has centered largely on advocating for racists wherever possible. This has included performing back-to-back unambiguous Nazi salutes in front of a large crowd, agreeing with a defense of Hitler’s actions in the Holocaust, and many other white supremacist statements. His advocacy hasn’t been limited just to the United States, he’s also meddled in other countries’ politics, including support for German neo-Nazis and rhetorical and monetary support in the UK for a violent racist fraudster who has been imprisoned multiple times. All of this has driven protests against the company, embarrassed owners and destroyed Tesla’s brand reputation, leading to falling sales in most territories. The behavior has limited Tesla’s business opportunities overseas, in the UK, Australia, Germany, Denmark, and so on. Musk also stated that he wants “more voting control, but not so much that I can’t be fired if I go insane,” claiming that that number is around 25% (but as the situation around this trillion-dollar award indicates, and the rest of Musk’s public behavior as listed above, that time has already passed). By the end of the call, Musk doubled-down on his “robot army”, stating further: I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here, and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis, who have no f**king clue. I mean those guys are corporate terrorists. Lemme explain the core problem here, so many of the passive funds vote along the lines of what ISS and Glass Lewis recommend. Now, they have made many terrible recommendations in the past that if those recommendations had been followed would have been extremely destructive to the future of the company. Now, If you’ve got passive funds that essentially defer responsibility for the vote to Glass Lewis and ISS, then you can have extremely disastrous consequences for a publicly traded company if too much of the publicly traded company is controlled by index funds. It’s de facto controlled by Glass Lewis and ISS. This is a fundamental problem for corporate governance, because they’re not voting along the lines that are actually good for shareholders. That’s the big issue, I mean, that’s what it comes down to. ISS Glass Lewis corporate terrorism. While Musk does not specify any of these supposed “terrible recommendations,” likely one of the ones he’s referring to was when ISS/Glass Lewis recommended a “no” vote on Musk’s illegal $55 billion pay package, which would pay a CEO who has overseen a significant drop in Tesla earnings more than double the total amount of money that Tesla has made in profits over its entire lifetime. And while Musk claims that having a disinterested entity interested in shareholder value is bad for shareholders, Musk apparently does not mind if he is that entity, and if his interests are opposed to shareholder interests, as in the case of the situation surrounding the current shareholder vote. In contrast to Musk’s statement, the actual analyses of ISS and Glass Lewis are highly analytical, lay out their case dispassionately, argue in favor of maintaining shareholder rights, and even take some positions in agreement with Tesla’s board where they think those would be beneficial for shareholders, showing their lack of “partisanship,” so to speak, on the matter. ISS and Glass Lewis’ arguments are certainly more detailed, more accurate to reality, less reeking of political language, and delivered with more lucidity than whatever the heck that robot army rant from Musk was all about. Robot armies are absolutely not the theme of many dystopian sci-fi movies. Not at all. We’ve stated before that Elon Musk’s $1 trillion stock award gets more ridiculous the more you look into it, but we didn’t quite expect something as ridiculous as today’s proclamation. But hey, if this dude from that weird rant above seems like the kind of “leader” you want to control a robot army, by all means, give up your voting rights for him.

    "content": "The legend of the ‘Tesla killer’ is not a myth anymore. It came true, and it’s not an electric vehicle from a legacy automaker or a new EV startup; it’s Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO. In the early days of Tesla, the media loved to use the term ‘Tesla killer’ every time a legacy automaker launched a new EV. At the time, we scolded them for using it, as they would apply it to electric vehicles that didn’t match Tesla’s performance, production volumes, or profitability. Sure enough, none of them came even close to negatively affecting Tesla, let alone “killing” the company. But things are changing now. Tesla is not growing at an insane pace like it was for a decade. In fact, it’s not growing at all anymore. Tesla’s global sales declined annually for the first time in 2024, and it is starting even worse in 2025. It is undisputable that the increased EV competition is having an impact, but there isn’t a single EV model that can be deemed a “Tesla killer”—even though we do see a couple of Chinese EVs as having quite an impact on Tesla. Most Tesla fans, myself included, thought that while Tesla’s market shares would go down amid more EV competition, its sales would continue to grow as EV adoption takes over the industry. That’s exactly what happened for a few years, but the trend reversed in 2024, and it’s not because of EV adoption. Global EV sales surged by 25% in 2024, while the sales of the biggest EV automaker, Tesla, declined by 1%. There are many reasons to explain this situation, but there’s one main culprit: Elon Musk. Musk has been completely delusional about Tesla achieving self-driving capability for years, which led him to neglect the rest of Tesla’s automotive business as he thought that by the end of every year for the last 6 years, Tesla would be able to flip a switch and make all its vehicles self-driving – automatically increasing their value and making them infinitely more competitive than other vehicles. How did Musk neglect Tesla’s automotive business? The clearest example is the fact that Tesla launched a single new vehicle in the last 5 years: the Cybertruck, which proved to be a total flop. The Cybertruck launched in 2023 at a much higher price and significantly shorter range than what was promised when unveiled in 2019. With a reservation backlog at over 1 million units, Musk said that he could see Tesla eventually selling 500,000 units a year and Tesla planned for an initial production capacity of 250,000 units a year. Now, a year and a half into production, Tesla is having issues selling the Cybertruck at 10% of its planned production capacity installed at Gigafactory Texas. Musk also canceled Tesla’s plan to build a “~$25,000 electric car”, which would have greatly fueled demand and allowed Tesla to grow its delivery volumes. The CEO didn’t believe that the vehicle program would make sense if Tesla solved autonomy. He said in October 2024: “I think having a regular $25,000 model is pointless. It would be silly. It would be completely at odds with what we believe.” What Musk, and by extension Tesla, believes is that the automaker is on the verge of solving self-driving, but he has thought that to be the case every year for the last 6 years. There’s no evidence that it is now on the verge of happening, or at least, not on the hardware that Tesla has delivered so far. It’s clear that this crucial mistake about the timeline of self-driving has led Musk to make many mistakes about how to manage Tesla in the last few years. For example, Tesla’s decision to remove turn signals and gear shift stalks from vehicles started with Model S and Model X in 2021. The CEO saw them as superfluous in a self-driving world, which he thought was imminent. Now, Model S and Model X sales have crashed. Tesla brought the same design to the Model 3 with the refresh last year. Seeing the mistake years later, Tesla decided to keep the turn signal stalk with the Model Y refresh this year, and the stalk is rumored to make a comeback on the Model 3. Perhaps the biggest mistake Musk has made about self-driving is promising that “all Tesla vehicles built since 2016 have the hardware capable of self-driving” to a level that would enable a robotaxi service, which in SAE self-driving terms would mean level 4-5. Musk himself has already admitted that Tesla has been wrong about that twice: the automaker had to upgrade Tesla owners having the “2.5 Autopilot computer” to the “3.0 self-driving computer”, which Musk recently admitted will also not be able to get Tesla to self-driving capabilities. He said that Tesla would “painfully” replace the computers in all vehicles of owners who purchased the “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) software package. However, we noted that Tesla is likely in more trouble than that since it promised that “all Tesla vehicles built since 2016 have the hardware capable of self-driving” – not just those whose owners bought the FDS package. Considering this greatly affects the resale value of those vehicles, you can make the argument that there are millions of Tesla owners out there who are owed a retrofit or compensation for Tesla’s mistake. This is a current liability at Tesla worth billions of dollars, and there are already examples of lawsuits about this issue. These are all management mistakes that ultimately fall on Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO. Then, there are plenty of mistakes that Musk has made outside of Tesla that is affecting the company. The hard turn to the right, buying Twitter, boosting misinformation and Russian propaganda on the platform, financially backing Donald Trump, joining the administration and slashing critical government program indiscriminately. Regardless of if you agree or not with Musk’s politics, these are things that you simply shouldn’t do as the face of a major consumer product company as you will undoubtedly anger a large part of your consumer base. That’s exactly what’s happening. There are now weekly demonstrations at Tesla stores around the world, and sales are crashing in many markets, especially in those where Musk got politically involved, like Germany, where Tesla sales are down 70% so far this year. Musk is virtually erasing two decades of hard work to build Tesla’s brand into the world’s leading when it comes to electrification and renewable energy. Now, for a large part of the population, Tesla is just seen as the piggybank of an out-of-touch oligarch. Tesla is not dead yet, but if Musk continues to be the face of the company, it looks like it’s certainly going in that direction as this brand issue and declining demand is not going away. Some of his fans cling to the idea that the automaker is about to solve self-driving, but this belief is largely based on Musk’s claims, which have been consistently wrong. Now, it’s not to say that Tesla hasn’t made great progress on that front, but if we are to listen to the company’s own goal to be safer than humans, it means achieving “miles between critical disengagement” equivalent to human miles between collisions, which is 700,000 miles, according to NHTSA. The latest available crowdsource data, a dataset that Musk has positively referred to twice lately, shows that Tesla is currently at about 500 miles between critical disengagement. While Tesla might not die under Musk, I sincerely think that, at best, it will be a fraction of what it was at its peak, which means no bigger than it is now or in 2023. Musk’s brand is toxic and doesn’t look to be improving significantly now that he has attached himself to identity politics, culture wars, and Trump. Looking at Tesla fans and shareholders who still support him, their main hope appears to be self-driving and robots. On the self-driving front, I think it’s delusional to believe that Tesla will solve self-driving on its current hardware. I think it has made some great progress, which may result in Tesla achieving valuable levels of self-driving on next-generation hardware in the next few years. However, others are on the same path, and you have to balance Tesla’s effort against the giant liability it created for itself by promising it on millions of other vehicles. As for the robots, I’m actually somewhat bullish on humanoid robots, and I do believe that Tesla has some competitive advantage on that front. However, it’s foolish to think they will simply leapfrog the competition, which is significant in the sector. The concept that building a $25,000 car doesn't make sense if you can \"solve autonomy\" is bizarre. Even if the TAAS pipedream turns out to come true (not particularly likely), there would still be a potentially vast market for the vehicle in the meantime over a period exceeding 15 years. Notably, the Toyota Corolla was the No. 2 vehicle in the world in 2024 and it starts at $22,000 in the US. Tesla’s core business remains selling cars and batteries. There’s no doubt that the business of selling cars is not going well for Tesla right now, and under Musk, there’s no clear path to improvement. The energy business is booming, but margins are falling, and competition is increasing—especially from companies like CATL and BYD, which supply the cells that Tesla uses for its stationary batteries. On the car side, Tesla is indeed planning to launch cheaper cars this year, but that plan was a pivot after Musk canceled the “$25,000 Tesla.” These new vehicles are expected to be built on the same platform as Model 3 and Model Y, so they will be closer to these models and cannibalize them. I’d be surprised if they are enough to avoid Telsa from having its annual deliveries decline again this year. I have been saying this for a while, but it’s time for Elon to go.

    "content": "Elon Musk announced that he is pushing Tesla to increase its electric vehicle production due to what he anticipates will soon be increased demand for autonomous driving. Tesla’s production plans have undergone significant changes over the last five years. The automaker started the decade growing at a roughly 50% annual rate and aimed to produce 20 million cars annually by 2030. Now, Tesla has a production capacity of less than 3 million vehicles, and it is using roughly only 60% of this capacity due to low demand. This situation has led Tesla to reconsider its plans for new factories, including its previously announced gigafactory in Mexico. Today, Tesla released its Q3 financial results, and CEO Elon Musk took the opportunity to announce that the automaker will now increase production: I feel confident in expanding Tesla’s production. So that is our intent, to expand as quickly as we can our future production. I was reticent to do that until we had clarity on achieving unsupervised full self-driving, but at this point, I feel like we’ve got clarity and it makes sense to expand production as fast as we reasonably can. The CEO stated that he is “100% confident” that Tesla will solve unsupervised self-driving – a claim he has made every year for the last six years. Musk said that once people can text inside their cars, demand won’t be an issue: Here’s the killer app: really, what it comes down to is, “Can you text while you’re in the car?” And if you tell someone, “Yes, the car is now so good you can be on your phone and text the entire time while you’re in the car,” anyone who can buy the car will buy the car. End of story. He added that the most significant increase in production will come from Cybercab, which he expects will enter production in Q2 2026. The vehicle lacks a steering wheel and pedals. Therefore, if Tesla doesn’t solve unsupervised self-driving by then, it will be useless. The CEO reiterated that he expects Tesla to remove the safety monitor from its Robotaxi in Austin, Texas, by the end of the year and release unsupervised FSD in consumer vehicles on the same timeline. Increasing production based on presumed demand coming from a feature, unsupervised self-driving, that isn’t finished, and that you have been consistently wrong in predicting. Elon always says that “people don’t understand how impactful self-driving will be.” I think they do. He is confusing people not believing his self-driving timelines with people not believing in self-driving. If Tesla does deliver unsupervised self-driving in HW4 vehicles, I do believe that it will result in a significant increase in demand. My prediction: Tesla launches Cybercab with a steering wheel and normal Tesla driving controls, with a promise that it will be fully self driving \"in about a year\". It will be the cheaper car (but not remotely near $25k cheap), and most importantly, every sale will count towards his compensation package. However, I don’t think Tesla is as close as Elon is leading shareholders to believe. Tesla may or may not remove the safety drivers from its Robotaxis in Austin, but that’s a geo-fenced areas with a bunch of limitations. Turning on unsupervised self-driving in consumer vehicles and Tesla taking responsibility for the system is an entirely different thing, and the automaker is not ready for it. But there’s some good that could come out of this. If Tesla increases Model 3 and Model Y production in anticipation of full self-driving, it could result in lower prices.

    "content": "The 2025 version of the Axios Harris poll of brand reputation is out, and it shows a sharp decline in the reputation of Tesla and other Elon Musk-related brands, putting them among the lowest-ranked brands in America, largely due to the toxicity of Musk himself. The Axios Harris Poll 100 ranks brand reputation of America’s 100 most visible companies, and asks a sample of thousands of Americans how they feel about each brand. The survey is a collaboration between Axios and Harris that has been going on since 2019, though is based on 20 years of similar Harris Poll research before then, starting in 1999. It has developed its own reputation as a reliable way to take temperature of the American public’s opinion on various high profile brands. It’s conducted through multiple samples of thousands of Americans, asking them what the most high-profile brands are, how familiar they are with those brands, and their opinions of those brands. Tesla has been ranked in the survey many times over the years, with varying results. In the first poll in 2019, it ranked 42nd, with a brand score of 75.4 out of 100. But Tesla rose from there, ranking 18th in 2020 and reaching a high-water mark as the 8th most trusted brand in America in 2021, with a reputation score of 80.2 out of 100. Since then, the company’s shine has started to tarnish, and it has been dropping in the rankings. 2022 saw a slight dip to #12 and a score of 79.5, but in 2023 Tesla took a huge hit, dropping a whopping 50 places in the rankings. Axios titled the poll the “year of the tarnished titans” partially due to Tesla’s huge drop. But the drop didn’t stop there, as Tesla dropped another position in 2024, down to #63, but with a brand score that would still at least be a barely-passing grade (for a lenient teacher), at 72.5 out of 100. But this year’s poll shows that things just continue to get worse, and in fact, the reputation damage is accelerating. In 2025, Tesla dropped another 32 places into 95th place, and down to a brand score of 61.3, a huge numerical drop in both position and brand score. The only companies ranked worse are: SpaceX, the third company run by Musk on the list, also earned a low reputation score, ranking 86th with a score of 66.4. Notably, there are several companies with bad reputations ranked above Tesla, many of which have had high-profile scandals either recently or that still loom large in the public consciousness. For example, those in the title of this article: BP, which presided over the Deepwater Horizon oil spill; UnitedHealth, which is currently imploding and whose former CEO was recently murdered in broad daylight and lots of people kind of didn’t seem to mind it; and Temu, which has faced data privacy lawsuits and is the butt of many jokes for selling low quality products, on top of general anti-China sentiment. For a few other names, another Chinese app, TikTok, is also ranked above Tesla. As is Fox Corporation, one of the largest purveyors of misinformation and causes of the political division we see in America today. And finally, Boeing, which spent last year wracked by scandals, yet is 7 places above Tesla on this year’s list. Meanwhile, every other automaker on the list ranked higher than Tesla by at least 35 places (Ford, #60). So, the news is quite bad for Tesla. But why is Tesla ranked so low? Well, as you may have divined from our repeated mention of a certain name, the primary reason is Tesla CEO Elon Musk. As we’ve been warning people about for quite some time now, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is doing his best to completely destroy Tesla’s brand. Musk has presided over an incredible amount of brand damage to Tesla, with the company ranking the lowest of any US EV brand in a recent survey. This negative perception seems to apply to pretty much any question asked about the brand, including its standout Supercharger network, which suggests that the reason isn’t anything to do with Tesla’s products. As an EV publication, we have the same mission as Tesla – to advance sustainable transport. In order for that to happen, we obviously want the (formerly) largest EV company in the world to do its job the best it can. The problem is, Musk doesn’t have that mission, and has been doing his best over the last year(s) to ruin Tesla’s brand perception with increasingly idiotic decisions, both in terms of his public advocacy and his work within Tesla. Musk’s high-profile political advocacy, which has included support for German neo-Nazis and agreeing with a defense of Hitler’s actions in the Holocaust, among many other white supremacist statements, has driven protests against the company, embarrassed owners and pushed many customers away. The first round of the poll started on Jan 22, which means it captured the period after Musk did two back-to-back Nazi salutes in public. Beyond politics, Musk’s leadership (or lack thereof) has also resulted in Tesla putting all of its effort into products that either don’t work or don’t sell, instead of focusing on Tesla’s strengths like its cost advantages and Supercharger network. So, once again, this report shows the effect of the constant drumbeat of bad Tesla business moves and horrendous public behavior by the company’s CEO. Indeed, it seems like the legend of the “Tesla killer” finally came true – and it’s Elon Musk. The company’s employees, for the most part, are still working to succesfully to make good electric vehicles. But Musk is spending the money he made from selling EVs to try to ruin EVs – something that the company itself had to call him out on in its quarterly report (and which the formerly-more-lucid Musk would have opposed just a few years ago before he forgot how climate change works). The hilarious thing is Leon endlessly denies it's happening. He's adopted the Trump strategy. But that doesn't work in this situation where he sells a product that MAGAts largely hate...and he helped passed a bill that will harm sales of Tesla products ! 😂 Unfortunately, Tesla’s board seems content to destroy the company, and its shareholders do too, as they voted again last year to give Musk $55 billion in exchange for his bad leadership, an award that is greater than the total amount of profits Tesla has made over its entire lifetime. That pay package was stopped by a court for violating corporate law, but Musk has spent his political influence getting Texas to rewrite its business laws to disadvantage shareholders and benefit Musk personally – even as Texas continues to block Tesla from selling cars in the state Musk unwisely moved its headquarters to. We’re not sure what’s going to make Tesla’s board (which have been dumping TSLA stock like mad) or shareholders wake up to Musk’s destruction of the company, but this report is just one more data point showing how severe the situation has gotten.
