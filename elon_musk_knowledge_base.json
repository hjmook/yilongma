    "content": "Hundreds of Tesla Cybertrucks have been spotted being delivered Elon Musk’s private companies, SpaceX and xAI, as Tesla is having issues selling the electric pickup truck. Cybertruck turned out to be Tesla’s first real commercial flop. After planning for a production capacity of over 250,000 units per year, Tesla is currently selling the pickup truck at a rate of ~20,000 units annually. A ~10% utiliation rate of a production line is a terrible situation for an automaker as much of the capital invested in the vehicle program becomes sunk cost. But things are even more difficult with Tesla, as even with much lower production, the automaker often ends up having inventory build-ups for the Cybertruck. Elon Musk has a solution: he had his private companies buy hundreds if not thousands of Cybertrucks. Several truckloads of Cybertruck were spotted being delivered to xAI’s offices this weekend. Furthermore, SpaceX has taken delivery of hundreds of Cybertrucks at Starbase of the last week and it is expected to take delivery of hundres, if not thousands more in the coming weeks. Wes Morrill, the Cybertruck lead engineer, commented on the delivery and said that SpaceX, along with Tesla, is replacing its support fleet with the Cybertruck: Love to see the ICE support fleets from Tesla and SpaceX get replaced with Cybertruck. When we were engineering it, this was always part of the dream. Never imagined how hard the fleet photos at starbase would go. Looking forward to more of this. He didn’t elaborate on how many vehicles SpaceX is expected to buy. As soon as it became clear that there was clear demand issues with the Cybertruck, I always wondered Tesla is not using them for its service fleet. It looks like SpaceX is doing it before Tesla, or at least on a larger scale, though Morrill is also saying that Tesla is transitioning its own support fleet to the Cybertruck. He also bought $1bn Tesla shares a month ago (and the share price went up 10-15%, adding $100bn value (city people cited his purchase as confidence in the company) - making him on paper $15bn richer - make that make sense).. But like all CEO's they don't take a salary - that's taxable. They buy houses, yachts using loans against the shares they own for collateral - then it's not taxable income. So presumably he bought shares in Tesla somehow using the shares he already owned. Here’s what I bet happened. Elon knew Q4 is going to be rough due to the demand being pulled forward because of the tax credit. However, there was a provision that if you lock in orders with unrefundable deposits before the end of September, you could still deliver vehicles in Q4 with the tax credit. I bet Elon had SpaceX and xAI order thousands of Cybertrucks before the end of Q3 to get these deliveries in for Tesla in Q4.

    "content": "Heybike has just unveiled its latest two-wheeled creation: the Helio F, a sleek new folding e-bike designed to bring a little vintage flair to your high-tech urban commute. Weighing in at just 18 kg (40 lb), the Helio F is one of the lightest folding electric bikes we’ve seen lately – and it’s clearly built with style-conscious city riders in mind. The move is all the more interesting considering most folder e-bikes today, including all of Heybike’s other folders, seem to opt for fat tires, big motors, high-capacity batteries, and other performance components that add to the poundage. But the Helio F goes the other direction with an eye on self-restraint and design to create a modestly powered but convenient folding e-bike platform. Underneath its retro-inspired looks lies a surprisingly capable commuter machine. The Helio F packs a 250W rear hub motor, paired with a torque sensor and a Shimano Altus 8-speed drivetrain, offering a natural-feeling ride with enough zip to get you through stop-and-go traffic. The 360Wh battery is tucked neatly into the downtube and promises up to 120 km (75 mi) of range in the most efficient pedal-assist mode. US riders will appreciate the available throttle mode and a top speed of 40 km/h (25 mph), while the EU version tops out at the standard 25 km/h (15.5 mph). Just keep in mind that the throttle will severely cut into the max claimed range. Braking is handled by Tektro hydraulic disc brakes, and the Schwalbe Billy Bonkers 20×2.0″ tires are tucked into a frame sporting a rigid thru-axle fork, keeping things light but rugged for daily use. Add in LED lights, a clean LCD display, and a recharge time of just 4–6 hours, and you’ve got a commuter bike that ticks a lot of boxes for riders in search of a simple, elegant folding e-bike. But perhaps the most eye-catching part of the Helio F is found just skin deep, or paint deep. Heybike teamed up with three international artists to create limited-edition models that double as rolling artwork. The designs are as eye-catching as they are innovative. Each version tells a different story, from surreal nature scenes to vibrant cityscapes, making the Helio F as much a conversation piece as a commuter tool. But getting the unique look will cost you a bit more. The fancy paint job models are priced at $1,399, while the ‘normal’ red or green models are priced at $1,299.

    "content": "A new whitepaper by heavy truck makers PACCAR and Dragonfly Energy that incorporates real-world fleet trial data and Environmental Chamber Testing conducted at the PACCAR Technical Center seems to indicate that over-the-road truck drivers are ready to embrace battery power and reduce emissions – just not while they’re driving. The whitepaper, titled Reducing Idle Time & Fuel Costs: Lithium Powered Solutions for Commercial Fleets, looked at different ways to reduce harmful diesel emissions across the duty cycles of a number of different fleet operations, and what they found was that powering a truck’s auxiliary and cabin systems with a high-voltage lithium-ion battery dramatically reduced engine idle time even under worst-case operating scenarios. Another report by a group called the Clean Air Task Force showed that idling heavy-duty diesel engines while drivers are “hoteling” in their trucks (they’re parked, but running the engine to power the sleeper cab’s climate controls, kitchens, or electronics) exacts a heavy toll on both drivers and shipping fleets. Idling not only burns fuel and increases operating costs at 0 MPG, it also emits a dangerous cocktail of harmul pollutants that pose direct health risks to drivers, rest stop employees, and nearby communities. Diesel exhaust contains fine particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), and numerous airborne toxins that are known carcinogens, making them a serious problem even to those who think climate change is a global conspiracy from “Big Science” to keep those plucky young oil billionaires in the place. From a mechanical standpoint, extended idling also accelerates engine wear, degrades emission-control systems, increases maintenance, and shortens engine life. By adding a relatively high capacity hybrid battery (like Dragonfly Energy’s Battle Born brand batteries) to the something like a PACCAR Kenworth T680 (at top), drivers can stay parked for several hours, operating their sleepers’ refrigerators, ACs, or heaters without the noise and emissions and costs of diesel – and they probably sleep better too, without the drone of neighboring diesels cranking on around them all night. “We believe idle reduction remains one of the most immediate and cost-effective ways fleets can reduce fuel consumption and emissions while improving driver comfort. But just as important, the industry is increasingly focused on operational efficiency and maximizing asset utilization,” explains Wade Seaburg, chief commercial officer at Dragonfly Energy. “We believe our collaboration with PACCAR not only validates the performance of our LiFePO₄-powered solutions, but also highlights how they help fleets maximize uptime, extend equipment life and get more out of their assets.” The electrification of the auxiliary systems also reduces engine hours, stretching out the time between scheduled maintenance and reducing operational downtime. In other words, the hybridization of OTR trucks is a win-win-win. The full whitepaper is available for download at BattleBornBatteries.com/Lithium-Powered-Idle-Reduction. Take a look at it yourself, then let us know what you think of the idea in the comments. SOURCE | IMAGES: PACCAR, Dragonfly Energy; via AP Newswire.

    "content": "French car brand Renault believes they’ve got the key to more affordable EV batteries, and their new LFP tech promises to slash the costs of production by 40%. The result? New, desirable EVs with a sub-20K price tag that aren’t made in China. Spanish news site Motorpasión is reporting that Renault, like Ford, is embracing a more affordable lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) battery chemistries that are safer, cheaper, and less dependent on rare mineral mining than conventional li-ion batteries. That’s a big change from the recent past. Because they’re less energy dense and weigh a bit more than comparably-sized lithium-ion NMC (nickel-manganese-cobalt) batteries, European automakers looked down on LFPs. But with Chinese automakers like BYD, MG, and Leapmotor flooding Europe with affordable LFP-powered EVs, that stigma is fading fast. The stability, battery life, and cost advantages of LFP have become too compelling to ignore — especially as global lithium and nickel prices continue to fluctuate, making long-term business projections difficult. Renault’s decision to embrace LFPs then, is less about catching up on the Chinese’ technology than it is about catching up catching up on the Chinese’ economics, and acknowledging that affordability is the real barrier to mass adoption. That was the thinking behind Renault’s relaunch of the R5 E-TECH (sold as the Le Car in the US) and the announcement that a new Twingo would be coming soon. It was also the thinking behind the French carmaker’s decision to launch the new Ampere vehicle software development sub-brand back in 2023. At the time, the stated goals were to improve (what are now called) Renault’s software-defined vehicles and, separately, to reduce manufacturing costs of new EVs by 40% – which, if you’ll notice, is just about what the switch to LFP chemistries will enable them to do. “Creating a new model of company specializing in electric vehicles and software running as of today: How better to illustrate our revolution and the boldness of our teams?” asked Luca de Meo, Renault Group CEO, at Ampere’s launch. He answered his own question, saying, “Instill a sustainable corporate vision and ensure it is reflected in each and every process and product. Build on the Group’s strengths and review the way we do everything. Form a tight-knit team and work for the collective. Harness our French roots and become the leader in Europe. Assert our commitment to our customers, our planet and those living on it.” This is great news. The French have a long history of producing fantastic little cars. If they can deliver at these price points they could do very well. I think a lot of people, like me, would be prepare to pay 10-15% more for Gallic flair (and to be honest there is probably some fond nostalgia in this preference). We desperately need alternatives to the Chinese manufacturers especially this size of vehicle. I see the Geely Xingyuan is $9k, but I am sure that will translate into all most double that internationally, and it does not look as good. Renault is set to launch an all-new, all-electric version of its iconic Twingo minicar from the 1990s in the next few months (at top). The car is targeted straight at the BYD Dolphin and is expected to have a starting price of about €17,000 (just under $20,000 US). SOURCE: Motorpasión; images via Renault.

    "content": "An investor group representing several large public pension funds has sent a letter urging Tesla shareholders to vote down Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s trillion-dollar pay package, and to replace all of the board members up for re-election, detailing its concerns about Tesla’s corporate governance and risk to long-term shareholder value. Tesla’s board recently announced a proposal for an eye-wateringly large pay package for its part-time CEO, Elon Musk. The package would be worth up to $1 trillion in stock, assuming various performance metrics are met, which are attached to the company’s stock rising significantly in value. It would be the largest pay package ever given to any CEO in history, by multiple orders of magnitude. The new proposal comes after a previous proposal to give Musk a $55 billion pay package, which was ruled illegal after the board misled shareholders and was ruled to be too closely tied to Musk. Tesla then put that same pay package up to another vote, using the same dishonest tactics, where it passed (by a relatively narrow margin, as far as board-recommended shareholder proposals go). Unsurprisingly, given that the same Elon-tied board engaged in the same misleading behavior as it had before, the pay package was again voided, saving Tesla shareholders $55 billion. But the story has continued. Tesla’s board moved in August to give Musk $26 billion, which would still be the largest pay package for any CEO in history. It’s also not far off from the total amount of profits Tesla has ever made over its entire lifetime (Tesla’s quarterly profits have been dropping for the last couple years, under Musk’s leadership). All Musk has to do to get the money is remain CEO for two years – with no requirement not to remain distracted with his other private companies which he has shown favoritism to or been distracted by. Musk says he wants the shares so he can have greater control over the company (after selling off much of that control to buy twitter) and defend himself from investors who would seek to replace him with a good CEO, but wants “not so much control that he can’t be thrown out if he goes crazy” (which he already has). The $26 billion award is different than the previous shareholder proposal, as the move won’t allow a shareholder vote, and can only be opposed by an investor holding a minimum of 3% of Tesla’s stock (or more than $4 billion dollars worth). This minimum is due to an undemocratic law passed by Texas, the state where Tesla moved its corporate headquarters to after famously pro-corporation Delaware applied the law to its previous illegal pay proposal. But the largest pay package ever in history does not seem to be enough for Musk and his captured board, and they’re now seeking $1 trillion. However, a large investor group, several members of which opposed the previous pay package, has come out against this one as well – and has asked investors to replace the Tesla board while they’re at it. A group representing several large pension funds sent a letter to Tesla investors today, detailing the problems it has with Tesla’s corporate governance. It recommends that shareholders vote against the reelection of Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia, and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, and vote against Proposals 3 and 4, which are both related to the $1 trillion award for Musk. The letter is signed by SOC Investment Group, Friends Fiduciary Corporation, SHARE, several state treasurers (CO, CT, MA, MD, NM, NV, VT), the New York City Comptroller, the American Federation of Teachers, and Afa Försäkring, a Swedish insurance group. These entities for the most part hold long-term funds (for retirement and the like) which are interested in stable corporate performance, rather than volatility. It points out Tesla’s declining performance over the last few years, with dropping sales and profits and high stock volatility. It says that the company is losing ground on EVs compared to competitors which have rapidly brought new models to market, while Tesla has not. It points out that even in the areas where Musk claims Tesla will be a leader, robotics and driverless taxis, it has not shown that it has a lead over competitors. The group blames this poor performance on a captured board. It points out that companies with independent boards perform better, and that Tesla’s board has deep personal ties to Musk, and thus cannot challenge him when he takes detrimental actions for the company. Two board members are current or former Tesla executives, four are friends or family of the CEO, and four have been tenured on the board for 10 years or more. And the board as a whole is highly paid, which threatens impartiality (and was subject to a lawsuit). Tesla’s board chair Robyn Denholm has been paid nearly 200 times as much as the average S&P 500 director. Further, the board has allowed Musk to be distracted with other companies and government misadventures, while overpaying him despite his lack of focus on the company. While these pay packages have been marketed in a way to claim that they will “energize and focus” Musk, there is a history of Musk channeling resources from Tesla, a public company where he should be beholden to the board and shareholders, to his own private companies, which the board has done nothing to stop. While only three directors are up for reelection, the investment group urges shareholders to vote down each of them. It notes that Ehrenpreis is a close friend of Musk, Wilson-Thompson has hundreds of millions of dollars in shares (and has been selling them rapidly while telling employees not to) and was the sole decider in the original proposal of Musk’s illegal $55b pay package, and Gebbia has noted personal conflicts of interest before. But beyond personal difficulties with each of these three directors, the group says that it is crucial to Tesla’s governance to replace as much of the board as possible, so that the process of overhauling Tesla’s poor governance can start. In discussing other specific proposals, the letter says that Proposal 3, which creates a pool of shares to be given to Musk and other employees, was only made necessary by the board’s improper award of stock to Musk in the $26 billion pay package. Further, combining proposals to create a pool of shares for Musk and for employees disallows shareholders from voting for the employee pool independent of the Musk pool. It takes issue with the way these shares are offered to Musk, which could have tax costs for Tesla shareholders, and suggests that if Musk wants more control, he could just buy shares (which he recently did). And on Proposal 4, the $1 trillion stock incentive, the letter states that the unprecedented nature of this payday is not matched by similarly unprecedented targets. It states that the performance targets are “vague” and “undemanding,” and “subject to significant discretion by what we believe is a non-independent Board.” It goes over each of the widely-reported performance targets, relating to vehicle sales, FSD subscriptions, delivery of “bots,” and operation of robotaxis, and describes how each of those targets could be weaseled out of in the way they are worded, and says that it lacks confidence that the board will demand real achievement of those targets. Even if other targets related to Tesla’s market capitalization are met, the letter points out that granting so much stock to Musk would dilute other shareholders, and that TSLA’s high volatility means that large price swings might result in equity awards for Musk which do not result from stable increases in shareholder value. Along with this dilution comes an “erosion of rights” for shareholders at Tesla. The move from Delaware to Texas removed some voting rights from shareholders, and the board has historically required supermajority shareholder votes for changes in corporate governance. While a proposal exists to remove supermajority requirements this year, the board has not recommended a vote on it. The letter concludes by stating that voting against these proposals is incredibly important, and could be the last time Tesla shareholders have meaningful say over the company. As Musk’s ownership percentage has fallen while he’s sold off stock for his various misadventures, this has opened up the possibility of shareholders voting in their own interests for once, rather than in Musk’s. The company itself has stated that the goal of these proposals is to ensure Musk has more control over the company, and then asks shareholders to give up their own control for a CEO who has proven to make poor decisions. We covered the last time an investment group with many of the same members called for a vote against Musk’s $55 billion pay package, and we agreed with that letter then, as we agree with this letter now. Unfortunately, shareholders made the wrong decision last time, but there’s still a chance to wake up now, despite that Musk has decided to temporarily focus all of his media efforts shilling for his trillion dollars. Putting aside the many ancillary issues of how Musk has behaved publicly in ways that oppose Tesla’s mission for the last few years (which has been bad for Tesla, both reputationally and politically), on a strictly corporate level, Musk has been a bad CEO. The company has falling sales in most markets, even as EV sales rise rapidly. Tesla might have been able to keep up if it had new models, but its only new model in 5 years is a flop. Musk cancelled the all-important $25k Tesla project, only to focus on robotaxis that don’t work after more than a decade of promises. He’s spent his time at other companies, and even channeled resources from public shareholders at Tesla to his own private hands. And he fired many of Tesla’s best-performers on an ego trip, causing chaos for the industry. We could (and do) go on and on about his poor leadership and how Tesla would do better with another CEO who doesn’t threaten the company and spew lies, and we hope that the ridiculous numbers attached to this stock award might make shareholders realize what a goofy idea it is to give a bad CEO so much money. We’ve also seen the ridiculous ads that Tesla keeps putting out, on a daily basis, shilling for shareholders to vote against their own interests. Yesterday, the company suggested that if Musk doesn’t get his trillion dollars in stock, Tesla employees won’t be able to afford houses. The whole thing is just stupid. But why are we at Electrek interested in this shareholder vote? Because we, as a publication that advocates for EVs and wants all the clean air and efficiency benefits that come along with them, want a strong EV industry (and, as lung-havers who live on this planet, you should too). And Tesla, which has for some time been at the forefront at that industry, needs to be strong in order to keep the industry strong. I completely agree with the investor's goals; the board does need to be independent and no CEO is worth $1T, especially not Musk with the way he's been not doing his job. [I'd go so as to say that the BoD should have a requirement that if a person is the CEO of Tesla that person can not be the CEO of any other company, public or private.] The letter is a good idea. However, a better idea is for the investors to recognize that Tesla is not a normal company nor is the stock normal, and to recognize that as long as Musk is in control of of the company with its puppeteer board that it's not going to be stable and based on solid financial principles like they want. Their better option would be start selling their stock and buy something else that better fits with their goals and leave the Tesla mess behind. If they want a car company in their portfolio, perhaps use the money to go buy BYD stock. Tesla drove innovation in EVs early on, but is no longer at the forefront. It could be again, if it had better leadership. And the first step at solving that problem is reining in the excesses of the leader who is currently running the company into the ground and harming the industry as he does so. Voting against this pay package, and against the captured board that has enabled this sort of behavior, is a concrete step that any Tesla shareholder can take to improve not just Tesla’s corporate governance, but the EV industry and, indeed, the future of the world’s transition towards sustainable transport.

We could (and do) go on and on about his poor leadership and how Tesla would do better with another CEO who doesn’t threaten the company and spew lies, and we hope that the ridiculous numbers attached to this stock award might make shareholders realize what a goofy idea it is to give a bad CEO so much money. We’ve also seen the ridiculous ads that Tesla keeps putting out, on a daily basis, shilling for shareholders to vote against their own interests. Yesterday, the company suggested that if Musk doesn’t get his trillion dollars in stock, Tesla employees won’t be able to afford houses. The whole thing is just stupid. But why are we at Electrek interested in this shareholder vote? Because we, as a publication that advocates for EVs and wants all the clean air and efficiency benefits that come along with them, want a strong EV industry (and, as lung-havers who live on this planet, you should too). And Tesla, which has for some time been at the forefront at that industry, needs to be strong in order to keep the industry strong. I completely agree with the investor's goals; the board does need to be independent and no CEO is worth $1T, especially not Musk with the way he's been not doing his job. [I'd go so as to say that the BoD should have a requirement that if a person is the CEO of Tesla that person can not be the CEO of any other company, public or private.] The letter is a good idea. However, a better idea is for the investors to recognize that Tesla is not a normal company nor is the stock normal, and to recognize that as long as Musk is in control of of the company with its puppeteer board that it's not going to be stable and based on solid financial principles like they want. Their better option would be start selling their stock and buy something else that better fits with their goals and leave the Tesla mess behind. If they want a car company in their portfolio, perhaps use the money to go buy BYD stock. Tesla drove innovation in EVs early on, but is no longer at the forefront. It could be again, if it had better leadership. And the first step at solving that problem is reining in the excesses of the leader who is currently running the company into the ground and harming the industry as he does so. Voting against this pay package, and against the captured board that has enabled this sort of behavior, is a concrete step that any Tesla shareholder can take to improve not just Tesla’s corporate governance, but the EV industry and, indeed, the future of the world’s transition towards sustainable transport.

    "content": "An investor group representing several large public pension funds has sent a letter urging Tesla shareholders to vote down Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s trillion-dollar pay package, and to replace all of the board members up for re-election, detailing its concerns about Tesla’s corporate governance and risk to long-term shareholder value. Tesla’s board recently announced a proposal for an eye-wateringly large pay package for its part-time CEO, Elon Musk. The package would be worth up to $1 trillion in stock, assuming various performance metrics are met, which are attached to the company’s stock rising significantly in value. It would be the largest pay package ever given to any CEO in history, by multiple orders of magnitude. The new proposal comes after a previous proposal to give Musk a $55 billion pay package, which was ruled illegal after the board misled shareholders and was ruled to be too closely tied to Musk. Tesla then put that same pay package up to another vote, using the same dishonest tactics, where it passed (by a relatively narrow margin, as far as board-recommended shareholder proposals go). Unsurprisingly, given that the same Elon-tied board engaged in the same misleading behavior as it had before, the pay package was again voided, saving Tesla shareholders $55 billion. But the story has continued. Tesla’s board moved in August to give Musk $26 billion, which would still be the largest pay package for any CEO in history. It’s also not far off from the total amount of profits Tesla has ever made over its entire lifetime (Tesla’s quarterly profits have been dropping for the last couple years, under Musk’s leadership). All Musk has to do to get the money is remain CEO for two years – with no requirement not to remain distracted with his other private companies which he has shown favoritism to or been distracted by. Musk says he wants the shares so he can have greater control over the company (after selling off much of that control to buy twitter) and defend himself from investors who would seek to replace him with a good CEO, but wants “not so much control that he can’t be thrown out if he goes crazy” (which he already has). The $26 billion award is different than the previous shareholder proposal, as the move won’t allow a shareholder vote, and can only be opposed by an investor holding a minimum of 3% of Tesla’s stock (or more than $4 billion dollars worth). This minimum is due to an undemocratic law passed by Texas, the state where Tesla moved its corporate headquarters to after famously pro-corporation Delaware applied the law to its previous illegal pay proposal. But the largest pay package ever in history does not seem to be enough for Musk and his captured board, and they’re now seeking $1 trillion. However, a large investor group, several members of which opposed the previous pay package, has come out against this one as well – and has asked investors to replace the Tesla board while they’re at it. A group representing several large pension funds sent a letter to Tesla investors today, detailing the problems it has with Tesla’s corporate governance. It recommends that shareholders vote against the reelection of Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia, and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, and vote against Proposals 3 and 4, which are both related to the $1 trillion award for Musk. The letter is signed by SOC Investment Group, Friends Fiduciary Corporation, SHARE, several state treasurers (CO, CT, MA, MD, NM, NV, VT), the New York City Comptroller, the American Federation of Teachers, and Afa Försäkring, a Swedish insurance group. These entities for the most part hold long-term funds (for retirement and the like) which are interested in stable corporate performance, rather than volatility. It points out Tesla’s declining performance over the last few years, with dropping sales and profits and high stock volatility. It says that the company is losing ground on EVs compared to competitors which have rapidly brought new models to market, while Tesla has not. It points out that even in the areas where Musk claims Tesla will be a leader, robotics and driverless taxis, it has not shown that it has a lead over competitors. The group blames this poor performance on a captured board. It points out that companies with independent boards perform better, and that Tesla’s board has deep personal ties to Musk, and thus cannot challenge him when he takes detrimental actions for the company. Two board members are current or former Tesla executives, four are friends or family of the CEO, and four have been tenured on the board for 10 years or more. And the board as a whole is highly paid, which threatens impartiality (and was subject to a lawsuit). Tesla’s board chair Robyn Denholm has been paid nearly 200 times as much as the average S&P 500 director. Further, the board has allowed Musk to be distracted with other companies and government misadventures, while overpaying him despite his lack of focus on the company. While these pay packages have been marketed in a way to claim that they will “energize and focus” Musk, there is a history of Musk channeling resources from Tesla, a public company where he should be beholden to the board and shareholders, to his own private companies, which the board has done nothing to stop. While only three directors are up for reelection, the investment group urges shareholders to vote down each of them. It notes that Ehrenpreis is a close friend of Musk, Wilson-Thompson has hundreds of millions of dollars in shares (and has been selling them rapidly while telling employees not to) and was the sole decider in the original proposal of Musk’s illegal $55b pay package, and Gebbia has noted personal conflicts of interest before. But beyond personal difficulties with each of these three directors, the group says that it is crucial to Tesla’s governance to replace as much of the board as possible, so that the process of overhauling Tesla’s poor governance can start. In discussing other specific proposals, the letter says that Proposal 3, which creates a pool of shares to be given to Musk and other employees, was only made necessary by the board’s improper award of stock to Musk in the $26 billion pay package. Further, combining proposals to create a pool of shares for Musk and for employees disallows shareholders from voting for the employee pool independent of the Musk pool. It takes issue with the way these shares are offered to Musk, which could have tax costs for Tesla shareholders, and suggests that if Musk wants more control, he could just buy shares (which he recently did). And on Proposal 4, the $1 trillion stock incentive, the letter states that the unprecedented nature of this payday is not matched by similarly unprecedented targets. It states that the performance targets are “vague” and “undemanding,” and “subject to significant discretion by what we believe is a non-independent Board.” It goes over each of the widely-reported performance targets, relating to vehicle sales, FSD subscriptions, delivery of “bots,” and operation of robotaxis, and describes how each of those targets could be weaseled out of in the way they are worded, and says that it lacks confidence that the board will demand real achievement of those targets. Even if other targets related to Tesla’s market capitalization are met, the letter points out that granting so much stock to Musk would dilute other shareholders, and that TSLA’s high volatility means that large price swings might result in equity awards for Musk which do not result from stable increases in shareholder value. Along with this dilution comes an “erosion of rights” for shareholders at Tesla. The move from Delaware to Texas removed some voting rights from shareholders, and the board has historically required supermajority shareholder votes for changes in corporate governance. While a proposal exists to remove supermajority requirements this year, the board has not recommended a vote on it. The letter concludes by stating that voting against these proposals is incredibly important, and could be the last time Tesla shareholders have meaningful say over the company. As Musk’s ownership percentage has fallen while he’s sold off stock for his various misadventures, this has opened up the possibility of shareholders voting in their own interests for once, rather than in Musk’s. The company itself has stated that the goal of these proposals is to ensure Musk has more control over the company, and then asks shareholders to give up their own control for a CEO who has proven to make poor decisions. We covered the last time an investment group with many of the same members called for a vote against Musk’s $55 billion pay package, and we agreed with that letter then, as we agree with this letter now. Unfortunately, shareholders made the wrong decision last time, but there’s still a chance to wake up now, despite that Musk has decided to temporarily focus all of his media efforts shilling for his trillion dollars. Putting aside the many ancillary issues of how Musk has behaved publicly in ways that oppose Tesla’s mission for the last few years (which has been bad for Tesla, both reputationally and politically), on a strictly corporate level, Musk has been a bad CEO. The company has falling sales in most markets, even as EV sales rise rapidly. Tesla might have been able to keep up if it had new models, but its only new model in 5 years is a flop. Musk cancelled the all-important $25k Tesla project, only to focus on robotaxis that don’t work after more than a decade of promises. He’s spent his time at other companies, and even channeled resources from public shareholders at Tesla to his own private hands. And he fired many of Tesla’s best-performers on an ego trip, causing chaos for the industry. We could (and do) go on and on about his poor leadership and how Tesla would do better with another CEO who doesn’t threaten the company and spew lies, and we hope that the ridiculous numbers attached to this stock award might make shareholders realize what a goofy idea it is to give a bad CEO so much money.

    "content": "Thousands of Britons have voiced opposition to a request by Tesla to supply electricity to British homes. And what’s the sole reason for this opposition? It’s because of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Last month, Tesla applied for a license to supply electricity to British homes. The application was sent to Ofgem, UK’s government energy regulator. In addition to Tesla’s business selling EVs, and its CEO’s business making promises about autonomy and robots that never materialize, Tesla is also in the business of selling energy products. The energy products include solar panels, after Tesla’s controversial acquisition of SolarCity, a company run by Musk’s cousin Lyndon Rive, in 2016. They also include Powerwalls, Tesla’s home battery backup system which can store energy from a home’s solar panels or from the grid, and then use it or sell it back to the grid later during peak hours when electricity is most expensive. But even more interestingly, Powerwalls can be hooked into a network, called a Virtual Power Plant or VPP, which allows thousands of batteries to simultaneously push energy to the grid when the grid needs it. This can help to end power outages and can also make a significant amount of money for homeowners who participate. A VPP can also help with overall grid stability. While a single battery doesn’t do much to help the entire grid, thousands of batteries all together can help to shave peaks and shift loads grid-wide, helping to enable the transition to renewable forms of energy generation like wind and solar, which can be intermittent due to weather, clouds, gusts of wind and so on. And the UK is doing quite well at renewable adoption – the island which started the industrial revolution because it’s literally built on a bed of coal just shut down its last coal plant last year. Clean electricity growth is strong, with over half of its electricity coming from renewables sources last year. And it has set even more ambitious goals going forward, targeting an 81% emissions cut by 2035. So, a VPP might be useful in a country with so much wind and solar. While Tesla’s application does not specify details of its plans (In accordance with UK law), it seems likely that the purpose behind the application would be to set up a VPP system in the UK. Tesla already runs VPPs in Texas and California. So, all sounds good, right? This is a useful product, and it can help the UK confront a challenge it will need to face as it transitions to a cleaner grid. And, at a time when electricity prices are going up worldwide, more competition and flexibility in energy markets can only be a good thing. The only problem? Everyone hates Elon Musk. A lot. As it turns out, Ofgem has been swamped with thousands of comments opposing Tesla’s plan, as a result of a campaign that says Musk shouldn’t be allowed to get anywhere near UK’s electricity supply. The campaign was launched by the group Best for Britain, which bills itself as “the researchers, data scientists, strategists, and activists, fixing the problems Britain faces after Brexit.” It set up an action campaign allowing Brits to send a letter to Ofgem stating their opposition to Tesla’s plan. The letter argues that Musk has proven, through his recent political activity, that he is not interested in the general wellbeing of the populace, but rather in “pushing his own agenda.” It accuses him of “dangerous incompetence or wilful neglect,” and says that these should be “disqualifying qualities for entrance into our energy markets.” For background, while Musk claimed to be working to reduce US government waste (when he actually increased the deficit), he in fact spent that time advising the US to defund entities investigating his unlawful actions. The letter also mentions the “rapid spread of misinformation, hatred and conspiracy theories in the UK and across the wider world” on twitter since Musk spent $44 billion to buy the company (that later dropped to a value closer to $15 billion – his recent purchase of it from himself notwithstanding). After Musk purchased the platform, hate speech has flourished there. None of the points made by the letter focus on Tesla’s business as a whole, but rather solely on its CEO’s harmful actions. As of yesterday, Best for Britain says 8,462 people had used it to contact Ofgem to voice their opposition to the plan. Public comment remains open until Friday, August 22. This is not the first time Tesla has received local opposition for business deals due to Musk’s poor public persona. In May, Australians voiced opposition to a plan to build a battery factory and Tesla showroom, where ~95% of comments opposed the plan (with some choice Australian language appearing in them). And just yesterday, the Austin American-Statesman reported opposition to Tesla’s tax breaks from residents of the county where its Texas Gigafactory is located. Separately, Musk has received pushback in the UK and elsewhere for his support for extreme rightwing and racist political figures, both in the US where he gave hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to a treasonous felon who tried to overthrow the US government, and in the UK where he has given both rhetorical and monetary support to a violent racist fraudster who has been imprisoned multiple times. His unambiguous Nazi salutes, agreeing with a defense of Hitler’s actions in the Holocaust, support for German neo-Nazis, and many other white supremacist statements didn’t help, either. Beyond his association with racist politics, he has also directly spread misinformation about climate change himself, despite this being a contradiction of Tesla’s mission. Musk has even said that his own recent actions are “not good for America or the world.” The result of these actions has been to drive protests against the company, embarrass owners and destroy Tesla’s brand reputation. Lol... what kind of corporate board rewards a CEO that COMPLETELY ALIENATED THE CORE CUSTOMER BASE with a $29 billion stock grant? 😂 In the UK specifically, Tesla sales have fallen by 60% year-over-year, according to the most recent July numbers. Tesla sales show similar trends in most territories in which the company sells, with Tesla sales down globally despite a rising global EV market. Nevertheless, despite Elon Musk demonstrably being the problem with Tesla right now, his friends and family on Tesla’s board recently gave him a ~$29 billion payout, claiming that it would “energize and focus” the company’s bad CEO.

The energy products include solar panels, after Tesla’s controversial acquisition of SolarCity, a company run by Musk’s cousin Lyndon Rive, in 2016. They also include Powerwalls, Tesla’s home battery backup system which can store energy from a home’s solar panels or from the grid, and then use it or sell it back to the grid later during peak hours when electricity is most expensive. But even more interestingly, Powerwalls can be hooked into a network, called a Virtual Power Plant or VPP, which allows thousands of batteries to simultaneously push energy to the grid when the grid needs it. This can help to end power outages and can also make a significant amount of money for homeowners who participate. A VPP can also help with overall grid stability. While a single battery doesn’t do much to help the entire grid, thousands of batteries all together can help to shave peaks and shift loads grid-wide, helping to enable the transition to renewable forms of energy generation like wind and solar, which can be intermittent due to weather, clouds, gusts of wind and so on. And the UK is doing quite well at renewable adoption – the island which started the industrial revolution because it’s literally built on a bed of coal just shut down its last coal plant last year. Clean electricity growth is strong, with over half of its electricity coming from renewables sources last year. And it has set even more ambitious goals going forward, targeting an 81% emissions cut by 2035. So, a VPP might be useful in a country with so much wind and solar. While Tesla’s application does not specify details of its plans (In accordance with UK law), it seems likely that the purpose behind the application would be to set up a VPP system in the UK. Tesla already runs VPPs in Texas and California. So, all sounds good, right? This is a useful product, and it can help the UK confront a challenge it will need to face as it transitions to a cleaner grid. And, at a time when electricity prices are going up worldwide, more competition and flexibility in energy markets can only be a good thing. The only problem? Everyone hates Elon Musk. A lot. As it turns out, Ofgem has been swamped with thousands of comments opposing Tesla’s plan, as a result of a campaign that says Musk shouldn’t be allowed to get anywhere near UK’s electricity supply. The campaign was launched by the group Best for Britain, which bills itself as “the researchers, data scientists, strategists, and activists, fixing the problems Britain faces after Brexit.” It set up an action campaign allowing Brits to send a letter to Ofgem stating their opposition to Tesla’s plan. The letter argues that Musk has proven, through his recent political activity, that he is not interested in the general wellbeing of the populace, but rather in “pushing his own agenda.” It accuses him of “dangerous incompetence or wilful neglect,” and says that these should be “disqualifying qualities for entrance into our energy markets.” For background, while Musk claimed to be working to reduce US government waste (when he actually increased the deficit), he in fact spent that time advising the US to defund entities investigating his unlawful actions. The letter also mentions the “rapid spread of misinformation, hatred and conspiracy theories in the UK and across the wider world” on twitter since Musk spent $44 billion to buy the company (that later dropped to a value closer to $15 billion – his recent purchase of it from himself notwithstanding). After Musk purchased the platform, hate speech has flourished there. None of the points made by the letter focus on Tesla’s business as a whole, but rather solely on its CEO’s harmful actions. As of yesterday, Best for Britain says 8,462 people had used it to contact Ofgem to voice their opposition to the plan. Public comment remains open until Friday, August 22. This is not the first time Tesla has received local opposition for business deals due to Musk’s poor public persona. In May, Australians voiced opposition to a plan to build a battery factory and Tesla showroom, where ~95% of comments opposed the plan (with some choice Australian language appearing in them). And just yesterday, the Austin American-Statesman reported opposition to Tesla’s tax breaks from residents of the county where its Texas Gigafactory is located. Separately, Musk has received pushback in the UK and elsewhere for his support for extreme rightwing and racist political figures, both in the US where he gave hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to a treasonous felon who tried to overthrow the US government, and in the UK where he has given both rhetorical and monetary support to a violent racist fraudster who has been imprisoned multiple times. His unambiguous Nazi salutes, agreeing with a defense of Hitler’s actions in the Holocaust, support for German neo-Nazis, and many other white supremacist statements didn’t help, either. Beyond his association with racist politics, he has also directly spread misinformation about climate change himself, despite this being a contradiction of Tesla’s mission. Musk has even said that his own recent actions are “not good for America or the world.” The result of these actions has been to drive protests against the company, embarrass owners and destroy Tesla’s brand reputation. Lol... what kind of corporate board rewards a CEO that COMPLETELY ALIENATED THE CORE CUSTOMER BASE with a $29 billion stock grant? 😂 In the UK specifically, Tesla sales have fallen by 60% year-over-year, according to the most recent July numbers. Tesla sales show similar trends in most territories in which the company sells, with Tesla sales down globally despite a rising global EV market. Nevertheless, despite Elon Musk demonstrably being the problem with Tesla right now, his friends and family on Tesla’s board recently gave him a ~$29 billion payout, claiming that it would “energize and focus” the company’s bad CEO.

    "content": "Republicans announced a new tax plan today and it’s just about as bad for America as expected, taking money for healthcare, clean air and energy efficiency from American families and sending it to the ultra-wealthy instead. You might think that this helps one of those ultra-wealthy, Elon Musk, who gave hundreds of millions of dollars to ani-EV candidates to help make this happen. But the main source of his wealth, Tesla, will be specifically harmed by rescission of EV credits – and its competitors largely won’t be. Now that the republican party has unveiled its job-killing tax proposal, we know a little more about what’s in it. Originally, it was thought by many that the proposal would completely kill all federal EV credits, with some estimating that the $7,500 credit would go away immediately (personally, I never thought it would be that stupid, but you never know with the republicans). But it’s clear they want to destroy the credit and make cars more expensive for Americans. After all, Donald Trump, while running for an office he remains Constitutionally barred from holding, asked oil companies for a billion-dollar bribe in exchange for ending the EV credit, a promise he has continued to say he will uphold as he squats in the aforementioned office. And last week, House Speaker Mike Johnson said that the House is likely to end the credit. It turns out the details are a little more nuanced than that, and that while the credit is ending, it will sunset a little later than many feared. It’s likely that the credit will last through the end of this year – which makes sense, since that’s how tax changes often work. Then, at the end of the year, Inflation Reduction Act credits will largely disappear. However, in the current draft of the bill, some automakers will retain access to some EV credits, for a time. This is due to an exception given for manufacturers who have not sold 200,000 vehicles between 2009 and 2025, a similar cap to the old EV tax credit that was first implemented in 2008, before Congress improved it and removed the cap in the Inflation Reduction Act. So, smaller manufacturers will continue to have some support, while large manufacturers who have already sold plenty of cars will lose all of their credits. A number of manufacturers have already reached the 200k EV cap, including Nissan, Ford, Toyota, Hyundai/Kia, GM, and of course, Tesla. Those manufacturers will lose access to credits. But others who started late or have more niche offerings continue to be under the 200k cap. These include companies like Mercedes, Honda, Lucid, Mazda and Subaru. Specifically, Rivian has been identified as one of the possible winners here, as the company has not yet sold 200,000 vehicles, though should be crossing that line sometime in the next couple years. And finally, the real competition for Tesla, gas cars, will not lose anything from the rescission of EV credits. Those cars will continue selling, they’ll just have a $7,500 advantage relative to today – on top of their advantage of each gas car being allowed to choke the world with $20,000+ in unpaid pollution costs, which show up on everyone’s hospital bills and health insurance premiums. So that brings up an interesting point: when Tesla and its bad CEO Elon Musk threw their support behind all of this, what did they think they would get out of it? After all, Tesla wrongly said, at the behest of Musk and his tortured logic, that ending EV credits would somehow help it. We called out that obvious incorrect statement at the time, saying that No, for crying out loud, killing EV subsidies will not help an EV company. But now it turns out that the situation is even worse for Tesla, because not only does Tesla’s gas competition get to keep the credits, but many electric competitors will get to keep them for some time as well. And don’t forget that this last quarter, government incentives were the only thing keeping Tesla from losing money. A regulatory environment that is more hostile to Tesla could turn black to red on the balance sheet, along with dropping sales and negative brand perception. Thank the bad CEO you voted to give $55B to for that loss, shareholders. But the oil companies, another competitor for Tesla, will continue to benefit from roughly $760 billion in subsidy per year in the US alone, in terms of the health and environmental costs they impose on society and do not pay for. If that subsidy was ended alongside the $7,500 EV credit, then EVs would indeed come out on top. But instead of ending those massive subsidies to fossil fuels, republicans have proposed to increase them, by cutting down enforcement and loosening pollution limits, both through this tax bill and through other agency actions and proposals. Further, the tax proposal unveiled today sunsets credits for many other products that Tesla sells. There are solar and home energy efficiency credits which Tesla takes advantage of through its Energy division, which sells solar and home battery systems to homeowners. These can be worth tens of thousands of dollars per installation, and those will go away if this proposal goes through. So in the end, Tesla loses access to credits both on its cars and its Energy division, while its competitors get an even more beneficial regulatory environment to continue polluting. And even its electric competitors get a temporary leg up for the time being. Meanwhile, Elon Musk gets his part of the $4.5 trillion in tax cuts that go directly to wealthy elites. So at least his pocketbook will look slightly better for a time, even though the company that has been responsible for filling it it will fall further due to less attractive product pricing and through his own association, which has driven protests against the company, embarrassed owners and pushed many customers away. He made is money off the carbon credits and now is moved on to other ways to make money and probably wants to close that door for others. So, to those of you who wanted us to “trust the plan” – how, exactly, is this beneficial to Tesla, again? Among the proposed cuts is the rooftop solar credit. That means you could have only until the end of this year to install rooftop solar on your home, before republicans raise the cost of doing so by an average of ~$10,000. So if you want to go solar, get started now, because these things take time and the system needs to be active before you file for the credit.

    "content": "Former Tesla engineer Cristina Balan, who was fired in 2014, said in an interview that her entire team was threatened with deportation for taking her side when she brought up a brake safety issue directly to Elon Musk. She’s now succeeded in throwing out Tesla’s arbitration case against her, and hopes to meet Tesla directly in open court in a case that could influence corporate policy nationwide. Cristina Balan is a Romanian-born engineer who formerly worked for Tesla on the Model S. Her contributions were significant enough that her initials appeared on the Model S’ battery pack. But in 2014, she brought up what she considered a safety issue directly with Elon Musk. She thought that the Model S’ floor mats could cause a brake safety issue, similar to a situation that Toyota had recently gone through (though that also led to a media firestorm that blew the issue out of proportion). She said that Tesla had chosen suppliers based on friendships, not quality. And she brought it up directly to Musk because… he told her to. Famously, in 2013, Musk sent out an email to the entire company stating: Anyone at Tesla can and should email/talk to anyone else according to what they think is the fastest way to solve a problem for the benefit of the whole company. You can talk to your manager’s manager without his permission, you can talk directly to a VP in another dept, you can talk to me, you can talk to anyone without anyone else’s permission. Moreover, you should consider yourself obligated to do so until the right thing happens. -Elon Musk, email to all Tesla employees, March 21, 2013 A few days after sending that email, Balan said she was offered a meeting with Musk, but that when she showed up to the meeting, it was instead attended by a lawyer and some large men in uniforms, and with Tesla forcing her to resign her position. During that meeting, Balan says that Tesla’s lawyer threatened to deport many members of her team, who were currently waiting on green card applications, if she didn’t sign the resignation, seemingly in response to her team backing her up in raising these concerns. She ended up signing the resignation in protest, writing on it that “I’m resigning for the position that I was put in a month ago bc I dare to speak up to the Sr management, also bc people that had the chance to speak up were threatened…” When Balan’s case got coverage in Huffington Post in 2017, Tesla sent a statement that Balan had stolen company resources to work on a “secret” personal project (Tesla emails show that Balan was told to work on this project by leadership). After this, Balan says she faced difficulty in finding work as companies feared ending up on Musk’s blacklist. Balan filed a defamation suit over the press statement, but Tesla forced her case into arbitration and got the defamation suit thrown out. Forced arbitration is widely used by companies in America to find faster and more corporate-friendly rulings, an approach that has only become more common after endorsement by the “Supreme” Court. Balan then appealed that decision, and after many delays (some related to her fight against breast cancer, which is now in remission), she finally succeeded in getting the arbitration thrown out on Monday – even though she represented herself, pro se, for most of the proceedings. Her win could be significant for corporate policy nationwide, as it could serve to chill the overuse of arbitration which is seen by most observers as giving disproportionate power to companies in labor disputes. However, given the nature of the court’s recent finding, which was found to be a jurisdictional issue, this decision may not be directly applicable to many other arbitration cases. Now, Balan wants to face Tesla in open court with her case, and hopes to bring more of her story to the public – which she says Musk has tried to stop her from doing, despite his claims of being a “free speech absolutist.” She said so in an interview this weekend with The Times UK, a media organization owned by climate denier Rupert Murdoch, who is also the father of James Murdoch, a Tesla boardmember. In the interview, Balan describes working conditions under Musk, and that he was a mostly-absent CEO who only showed up to the office twice a month, would threaten or retaliate against those who tried to fix problems. She says that she wants to take her case to open court “to prove how vindictive this monster is. He’s pure evil… he’s enjoying hurting people… and you don’t know about them because he’s forcing everybody to give up their freedom of speech and their right to sue.” You can watch the whole interview below: We haven’t written about Balan’s case before because it’s been such a long time coming, and filled with various arcane legal wranglings. There will likely be more steps to come, many of which are boring legal maneuvers, but perhaps this case will now have a chance to go more public now that the arbitration decision has been thrown out. And, frankly, I think the initial complaint over floor mats was probably not all that significant of a blockbuster. At the time, floor mats were getting a lot of focus due to the high-profile nature of the Toyota case (which was also overstated), so I think Balan’s team was probably more wary than usual. And we didn’t go on to see a slate of floor mat problems with the Model S in the time since. However, Tesla’s response to bringing up the safety issue is still unacceptable (to say the least). Not only were all employees told to take steps like this to get problems solved by the CEO himself, but the strong-arm nature of a quick firing in response, and then threatening her team with deportation is beyond the pale. While we only have Balan’s words as evidence for the deportation threat, we have since seen Musk take vindictive actions against entire teams, and seen his anti-immigrant attitudes including the desire to deport people illegally. Recently Musk fired the entire supercharger team, in what was probably the dumbest business decision Tesla has ever made, reportedly because Rebecca Tinucci, a star of the auto industry and the head of the most successful team in Tesla, refused to fire more people. (Incidentally, another longtime Tesla exec who was fired at the same time as the whole Supercharger team, Daniel Ho, had previously praised Balan, saying “without creative engineers like you, this place would be just another car company”) And Musk is also the largest financial backer of an administration that is currently illegally deporting legal residents to a prison famous for beatings, overcrowding and food deprivation that some have called a place to “dispose of people without formally applying the death penalty” – and threatening to do the same to US citizens. \"Balan says that Tesla’s lawyer threatened to deport many members of her team, who were currently waiting on green card applications, if she didn’t sign the resignation, seemingly in response to her team backing her up in raising these concerns.\" There it is. Elon abusing workers with lawfare. This is why he so desperately wants H-1b visas....so he can have low cost labor trapped in their jobs. Musk has spent much of his public advocacy in recent years showing racist and anti-immigrant attitudes, including support for German neo-Nazis and agreeing with a defense of Hitler’s actions in the Holocaust. He’s focused more on pushing his white supremacist views than on anything to do with EVs and climate change (which he’s now pushing denial of), thus working against Tesla’s mission. So, making deportation threats against immigrants does not seem out of character, despite Musk being a formerly “illegal” immigrant himself. Either way, we look forward to hearing more about this case as it goes on, in the hopes that it can both elucidate more for the public what the real Elon Musk is like, and possibly do something to reduce, ever so slightly, the abuse of the arbitration system by companies.

    "content": "Tesla is trying to use a piece of property in Australia, near Adelaide, in order to build a battery factory and Tesla showroom. But it’s facing steep opposition from locals, most of whom cite dissatisfaction with Tesla CEO Elon Musk as their reason to oppose the project. The plans center on Marion, a small city of population 4,101, a suburb of Adelaide, the capital of South Australia. Last month, a developer submitted plans to use a piece of land referred to as Chestnut Court Reserve, which has been inaccessible to the public since 2016 due to contamination concerns. Plans to develop the location would involve a requirement to clean up the contamination on the site. They would also involve the cutting of several trees on the site, some of which have been deemed as “dead or ill health,” with a plan to plant trees at another site to make up for any removals. The developer said it would use this land to build a new fit-for-purpose factory facility that would be used by Tesla both as a showroom and service center for Tesla vehicles, and also a facility that could be used for “repurposing of Tesla batteries.” The plan doesn’t go too deep into the specifics of how said repurposing would happen, but it could involve using Tesla vehicle batteries in Powerwalls, or in Tesla’s Powerpack grid storage projects, which are quite popular in South Australia, where they have helped to solve some of the region’s significant power stability problems. The developer makes the case that Tesla already has a presence in the area in neighboring Tonsley, that Tesla’s mission (and the specific mission of a battery recycling center) supports the environmental goals of the community, and that the facility would create around 100 full-time jobs in the local community, including highly skilled jobs like battery researchers. All in all, the developer thinks it would inject $56 million into the local community, quite a nice chunk of change for the small town. And the city council also supports the plan, thinking that the job and economic benefits are worth it, particularly given that the land is not being used for anything else. The plans were submitted, the residents were consulted, and now that all the chips are on the table… the residents aren’t having it. The local community gave significant pushback to this idea, with some ~95% of residents disapproving the plan. The city received 948 comments on the plan, which sounds like quite a lot for a city of 4,101 people. However, half of those comments came from outside the city’s area. But among those comments from the immediate area of the development, only 11 comments favored the plans, with 121 opposing them (that’s 92% opposition). Among the comments (quoted by The Guardian) come these gems, which wonderfully showcase the stereotypical Australian predilection for colorful language: We’ll let you try to fill in some of those words, though we’re pretty sure what some of them are (and, honestly, while I somewhat understand the point of redacting profanity in public records, I’d say it is a little absurd to redact “nazi”). The plans haven’t received their final vote yet, and the council still seems like it wants to convince the local community to go forward with them. But some residents suggest that the site could be better used by other companies, and that alternate uses could help to preserve that land and also avoid potential image concerns for the area as protests against Tesla continue globally. Some other comments, perhaps wrongly, called the possible building “a noisy, ugly, planet-destroying temple to billionaires.” While it’s disappointing to see a proposed recycling facility referred to thusly (although Tesla does have a questionable history when it comes to following local environmental rules), it’s just another sign of how Tesla CEO Elon Musk is drastically affecting the brand, and holding it back from its stated mission to advance sustainable transport. The responses show just how damaging Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been to the company with his recent public advocacy, which has included performing back-to-back unambiguous Nazi salutes in front of a large crowd, agreeing with a defense of Hitler’s actions in the Holocaust, and many other white supremacist statements. His advocacy hasn’t been limited just to the United States, where he is currently working to balloon the US deficit and is the largest funder of the republican party who are trying to tax EVs and send US jobs to China, which will harm the US auto industry long term. He’s also meddled in other countries’ politics, including support for German neo-Nazis. A few years ago South Australia welcomed Elon Musk with open arms as he built a first of a kind giant battery in the state. That's how far Elon Musk has fallen. The backlash, like Musk’s advocacy, has been global. Tesla sales are dropping in most regions, even as EV sales rise as a whole. Specifically in Australia, Tesla sales saw a big drop year-over-year. And this has applied to corporate customers too, with Tesla losing corporate sales as multiple companies have cited their distaste with the CEO. These actions have driven protests against the company, embarrassed owners and pushed many customers away, and even resulted in a hack that doxxed many Tesla owners. While Musk has tried to brush these falling sales numbers off, it’s clear that he personally is doing incredible brand damage to the company.

    "content": "Tesla (TSLA) released its financial results and shareholders’ letter for the first quarter (Q1) and full-year 2025 after market close today. We are updating this post with all the details from the financial results, shareholders’ letter, and the conference call later tonight. Refresh for the latest information. As we reported in our Tesla Q1 2025 earnings preview yesterday, the Wall Street consensus for this quarter was $21.345 billion in revenue and earnings of $0.41 per share. The expectations had been significantly downgraded over the last month, as analysts were surprised by Tesla’s announcement of much lower deliveries than expected in the first quarter. After the market closed today, Tesla released its financial results for the first quarter and confirmed that it missed expectations with earnings of $0.27 per share (non-GAAP), and it also missed revenue expectations with $19.335 billion during the last quarter. This is a big miss for Tesla despite the company admitting to selling a lot more regulatory credits this quarter. At $595 million in credit sales, Tesla would have lost money without it in Q1 2025: I think Q2 will be worse. Cybertruck recall cost will be impacted in Q2. Tariff cost are mostly in Q2. Combined with more sales drop and potential economic down turns, the Q2 drop may be even greater. In short, Tesla is on the verge of being a money-losing company. We will be posting our follow-up posts here about the earnings and conference call to expand on the most important points (refresh the page to see the most recent posts): Here’s Tesla’s Q1 2025 shareholder presentation in full: Here’s Tesla’s conference call for the Q1 2025 results: FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

    "content": "The 2025 version of the Axios Harris poll of brand reputation is out, and it shows a sharp decline in the reputation of Tesla and other Elon Musk-related brands, putting them among the lowest-ranked brands in America, largely due to the toxicity of Musk himself. The Axios Harris Poll 100 ranks brand reputation of America’s 100 most visible companies, and asks a sample of thousands of Americans how they feel about each brand. The survey is a collaboration between Axios and Harris that has been going on since 2019, though is based on 20 years of similar Harris Poll research before then, starting in 1999. It has developed its own reputation as a reliable way to take temperature of the American public’s opinion on various high profile brands. It’s conducted through multiple samples of thousands of Americans, asking them what the most high-profile brands are, how familiar they are with those brands, and their opinions of those brands. Tesla has been ranked in the survey many times over the years, with varying results. In the first poll in 2019, it ranked 42nd, with a brand score of 75.4 out of 100. But Tesla rose from there, ranking 18th in 2020 and reaching a high-water mark as the 8th most trusted brand in America in 2021, with a reputation score of 80.2 out of 100. Since then, the company’s shine has started to tarnish, and it has been dropping in the rankings. 2022 saw a slight dip to #12 and a score of 79.5, but in 2023 Tesla took a huge hit, dropping a whopping 50 places in the rankings. Axios titled the poll the “year of the tarnished titans” partially due to Tesla’s huge drop. But the drop didn’t stop there, as Tesla dropped another position in 2024, down to #63, but with a brand score that would still at least be a barely-passing grade (for a lenient teacher), at 72.5 out of 100. But this year’s poll shows that things just continue to get worse, and in fact, the reputation damage is accelerating. In 2025, Tesla dropped another 32 places into 95th place, and down to a brand score of 61.3, a huge numerical drop in both position and brand score. The only companies ranked worse are: SpaceX, the third company run by Musk on the list, also earned a low reputation score, ranking 86th with a score of 66.4. Notably, there are several companies with bad reputations ranked above Tesla, many of which have had high-profile scandals either recently or that still loom large in the public consciousness. For example, those in the title of this article: BP, which presided over the Deepwater Horizon oil spill; UnitedHealth, which is currently imploding and whose former CEO was recently murdered in broad daylight and lots of people kind of didn’t seem to mind it; and Temu, which has faced data privacy lawsuits and is the butt of many jokes for selling low quality products, on top of general anti-China sentiment. For a few other names, another Chinese app, TikTok, is also ranked above Tesla. As is Fox Corporation, one of the largest purveyors of misinformation and causes of the political division we see in America today. And finally, Boeing, which spent last year wracked by scandals, yet is 7 places above Tesla on this year’s list. Meanwhile, every other automaker on the list ranked higher than Tesla by at least 35 places (Ford, #60). So, the news is quite bad for Tesla. But why is Tesla ranked so low? Well, as you may have divined from our repeated mention of a certain name, the primary reason is Tesla CEO Elon Musk. As we’ve been warning people about for quite some time now, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is doing his best to completely destroy Tesla’s brand. Musk has presided over an incredible amount of brand damage to Tesla, with the company ranking the lowest of any US EV brand in a recent survey. This negative perception seems to apply to pretty much any question asked about the brand, including its standout Supercharger network, which suggests that the reason isn’t anything to do with Tesla’s products. As an EV publication, we have the same mission as Tesla – to advance sustainable transport. In order for that to happen, we obviously want the (formerly) largest EV company in the world to do its job the best it can. The problem is, Musk doesn’t have that mission, and has been doing his best over the last year(s) to ruin Tesla’s brand perception with increasingly idiotic decisions, both in terms of his public advocacy and his work within Tesla. Musk’s high-profile political advocacy, which has included support for German neo-Nazis and agreeing with a defense of Hitler’s actions in the Holocaust, among many other white supremacist statements, has driven protests against the company, embarrassed owners and pushed many customers away. The first round of the poll started on Jan 22, which means it captured the period after Musk did two back-to-back Nazi salutes in public. Beyond politics, Musk’s leadership (or lack thereof) has also resulted in Tesla putting all of its effort into products that either don’t work or don’t sell, instead of focusing on Tesla’s strengths like its cost advantages and Supercharger network. So, once again, this report shows the effect of the constant drumbeat of bad Tesla business moves and horrendous public behavior by the company’s CEO. Indeed, it seems like the legend of the “Tesla killer” finally came true – and it’s Elon Musk. The company’s employees, for the most part, are still working to succesfully to make good electric vehicles. But Musk is spending the money he made from selling EVs to try to ruin EVs – something that the company itself had to call him out on in its quarterly report (and which the formerly-more-lucid Musk would have opposed just a few years ago before he forgot how climate change works). The hilarious thing is Leon endlessly denies it's happening. He's adopted the Trump strategy. But that doesn't work in this situation where he sells a product that MAGAts largely hate...and he helped passed a bill that will harm sales of Tesla products ! 😂 Unfortunately, Tesla’s board seems content to destroy the company, and its shareholders do too, as they voted again last year to give Musk $55 billion in exchange for his bad leadership, an award that is greater than the total amount of profits Tesla has made over its entire lifetime. That pay package was stopped by a court for violating corporate law, but Musk has spent his political influence getting Texas to rewrite its business laws to disadvantage shareholders and benefit Musk personally – even as Texas continues to block Tesla from selling cars in the state Musk unwisely moved its headquarters to. We’re not sure what’s going to make Tesla’s board (which have been dumping TSLA stock like mad) or shareholders wake up to Musk’s destruction of the company, but this report is just one more data point showing how severe the situation has gotten.

    "content": "As Elon Musk moves to dismiss a lawsuit from Tesla shareholders claiming he failed his fiduciary duties, OpenAI is now suing Musk and exposing lies, which could help Tesla shareholders. It looks like cracks are forming in Elon Musk’s armor of lies. Last year, Tesla investors sued Musk for breach of fiduciary duty and resource tunneling over the founding of xAI, a private AI company under his control. Musk had previously stated that Tesla would be a major player in AI and that AI products would be critical to Tesla’s future, but in early 2024, the CEO threatened not to build AI products at Tesla if he didn’t get more control over the company by getting more shares. He also redirected NVIDIA AI hardware acquired by Tesla to xAI and hired Tesla employees to work at xAI. In short, Tesla shareholders argue that Musk is in breach of his fiduciary duties to shareholders by creating a private company that competes directly with Tesla. The lawsuit also cites similar issues with Musk’s acquisition of Twitter. This week, Musk and Tesla board members, who are also defendants in the lawsuit for not stopping Musk, have filed to try to dismiss the lawsuit (via Bloomberg): The shareholder suit by a group of pension funds and other investors “is long on hyperbole but woefully short on well-pled facts,” the board members said in a court filing Monday. “Yet they cannot escape the undeniable reality: Tesla has thrived under this board and CEO, delivering astronomical returns to stockholders while advancing its mission to create sustainable abundance for all.” It will likely take a while before the lawsuit moves through the court, but in the meantime, Tesla shareholders have found a strong ally: OpenAI. Musk has long been tormenting OpenAI with lawsuits. Tesla’s CEO co-founded OpenAI as a non-profit in 2015 to develop an artificial general intelligence that positively contributes to humanity. In early 2018, Musk resigned from OpenAI, citing “conflicts of interest with Tesla.” At that time, Tesla’s CEO started pushing the automaker increasingly toward self-driving, which he often described as “real-world AI,” and the automaker began to compete for AI talent with OpenAI. While he was seemingly on good terms with OpenAI after his departure, a few years later, he started publicly criticizing the organization for moving to a limited for-profit model, which they argued was necessary due to the billions of dollars required to build the compute training hardware to have an impact in the AI sector. Musk even sued the company over the move and repeatedly publicly mocked them. It hasn’t been clear how serious the legal actions have been since Musk even claimed that he would drop the lawsuit if OpenAI changed its name: OpenAI has been defending itself with the release of some emails that show Musk actually agreed for years that the organization needed to move to a for-profit model. Now, OpenAI has countersued Musk and released more details that show Musk has been misleading the public for years. It also explains his latest moves at Tesla and xAI. All the documents released by OpenAI as part of the countersuit paint a much clearer picture of Musk’s involvement with AI and how it evolved over the years. I’ll start with a clear timeline to make it easier to understand. OpenAI has all the receipts to prove this. I recommend reading all the emails because they give great insights into Musk’s persona and how he presents himself publicly versus what he says privately. Here are some of the highlights to prove the timeline above: Early on in the founding of OpenAI in 2015, it was proposed to be a non-profit linked to Y Combinator, Sam Altman’s company at the time, and Musk was already suggesting to make it a regular C corp: OpenAI shared many internal emails and text messages between the teams, Musk, and Musk’s executive assistant/future baby mama, Shivon Zilis, discussing the need for much more capital, which will require a move to for-profit. In 2017, as OpenAI was first configuring a potential for-profit arm, Musk tried to take control by asking for preferred shares and a supermajority: Musk even filed for a new benefit corporation, a for-profit legal structure that aims to generate profits while positively impacting society and/or the environment. Musk’s full-time money manager, Jared Birchall, is listed as the sole director of the new corporation. OpenAI rejected Musk’s proposal as it would have given him complete control, but they insisted they still wanted to work with him. In early 2018, Musk switched up his proposal to try to get OpenAI attached to Tesla: This proposal also failed, as OpenAI felt this was also an attempt from Musk to gain complete control. Musk then left OpenAI and focused his AI efforts on Tesla until he significantly reduced his stake in the company to buy Twitter on a whim. Then, he founded xAI to become his main AI effort as a private company under his control while telling Tesla shareholders that the company was an “AI and robotics play.” xAI recently absorbed X (Twitter), resulting in a $125 billion company based on Musk’s made-up valuation. This is extremely revealing. It clearly shows that Musk’s main goal is to have complete control over AI. He tried to get control of OpenAI, but couldn’t make it work. He then tried to make it work with Tesla, but he screwed up by giving up some control (I’d argue he still has a firm hold on the public company) through the acquisition of Twitter. He panicked after OpenAI launched ChatGPT and started xAI as a private company entirely under his control, devaluing Tesla in the process – hence the current shareholders’ lawsuit. For years, Musk attacked OpenAI and lied to the public about disagreeing with the for-profit transition, when he was actually pushing for it since the very beginning. The only difference is that OpenAI was now a competitor to Tesla, and then xAI. I want to be clear here. OpenAI is not completely clean, either. It obviously owes Musk something for the company’s original funding, but the emails also reveal that the organization tried to give him shares and pay him back, but Musk refused. About time. This is promising and has huge implications beyond Tesla but also to the power of oligarchs to benefit themselves at the expense of all others. Focusing on Tesla, I suspect that in the short term this may cause some harm to the firm but getting this resolved would free it from what seems to be it's biggest risk -- Elon. I know that many at Tesla are still committed to the original mission and having Tesla focused again on that mission would be good for all involved. His refusal is likely linked to his believing that he could do more damage by suing OpenAI. It looks like Musk believes that he is some sort of super genius who deserves to be the one in control of a potential future AGI, and he was willing to lie and cheat his way into making it happen. Even if his intentions are good, that’s a scary thought. If you are interested in going solar, now is the time, and we suggest using EnergySage.

    "content": "A rift appears to be forming between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Trump over a disagreement over tariffs. Musk’s brother and Tesla board member, Kimball Musk, is getting involved and has even insulted the President. A few years ago, Musk was telling Trump that he was “too old” and that he should “ride into the sunset,” while Trump said that Musk would be “worthless” without subsidies that he could have made him “drop to his knees and beg”: Three years and $250 million in political donations later, Trump is now calling Musk a “genius” and he loves his electric cars. On the other hand, Musk said that “Trump is the only one who can save the Western world” and that he loves him a lot: I love Donald Trump as much as a straight man can love another man. Many didn’t see this love story surviving a full term. I, myself, predicted it wouldn’t survive 2025, and it looks like it’s already starting. While Musk has given his full support to Trump, there’s one thing he has never commented on: tariffs. Trump has been obsessed with implementing tariffs, which were finally announced on all trade partners last week and were worse than many people believed. Even though Trump campaigned on it and already announced tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico in February, Musk only first commented on them late last month when he said that Tesla will see a “significant impact” from tariffs. But he didn’t talk against them. This week, he is pushing back for the first time. In a talk with Italy’s deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, Musk said he was “hoping” for no tariffs between Europe and North America: “I’m hopeful for example with the tariffs…that at the end of the day…it is agreed that Europe and the U.S. should move, ideally in my view, to a zero tariff situation—effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America.” Musk also clashed on X with Peter Navarro, a controversial economist, top trade advisor to the President, and the person believed to be behind Trump’s obsession with tariffs. Tesla’s CEO called him a “moron.” Now, the Washington Post is reporting that Musk had tried to intervene directly with Trump on tariffs, but his attempt has apparently failed. Kimball Musk, Elon’s brother and a Tesla board member, was fully on board with Trump after his brother announced his support, but he has now soured on the President. The Tesla board director went on a rant on X with several posts criticizing the tariffs and went as far as insulting the President: There’s clearly a rift building between the Musks and Trump over the tariffs. I said I’d be surprised if the Elon/Trump partnership survives 2025. I think the fallout is now ahead of schedule. Despite my issues with Musk, I hope he wins this argument since I think those tariffs are some of the worst economic policies ever implemented by a major country and will have dramatic negative impacts worldwide, but I have my doubts. Many believe that Trump has been attached to tariffs so much that it would be hard for him to drop them, but I’m not in that camp. Trump has pivoted so many times that I wouldn’t be shocked if he did it on tariffs. While I am formally trained as a a STEM professional, I find it interesting how similar Musk and Trump are: 1) Both claim having advanced skills /intelligence but REFUSE to share their educational transcripts as proof 2) Both take claim for the WINS in their careers yet rarely ACCEPT responsibility for the FAILS 3) Both stretch the truth to unbelievable levels despite when proven otherwise 4) Both are quick to name call/bully those who do not praise them/kiss the proverbial ring 5) Both seem to have few people around them that see them as long-term friends I can see how they may feel a sense of familiarity to one another. Kindred spirits indeed. I think it’s more about how useful he sees Musk right now compared to other people in his entourage. Musk’s money is useful, but he failed to win the Wisconsin election despite spending over $25 million. DOGE is also proving increasingly less popular, and Musk’s approval ratings are dropping quicker than Trump’s. On the other hand, I think Musk will walk on eggshells around Trump. He will not push too hard on this even if he knows that this is about to crash the economy because the President remains too useful for him. I am sure he aims for a pardon before everything is said and done. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

    "content": "When Tesla CEO Elon Musk publicly denied a report that Tesla had canceled its work on the $25,000 “Model 2” despite the project ending weeks prior, Tesla executives were “alarmed” by Musk’s public lie, according to a new report by Reuters. In April 2024, Reuters reported that the long-awaited $25,000 Tesla, nicknamed “Model 2” by the public, had been canceled. Immediately after the report, Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded, stating “Reuters is lying (again).” However, when he made this statement, Musk knew that the report was correct, and that he had cancelled the project weeks earlier. This new information comes from a report by Reuters today, citing company documents and the standard “people familiar with the matter.” The public denial caused confusion among Tesla executives, some of whom wondered if the project was back on, or who were concerned that customers may delay purchases waiting for a product that they and Musk knew would never come. It also concerned executives due to an agreement Musk made with the SEC which required a lawyer to oversee his Tesla-related tweeting activities, after he had previously been caught misleading investors into thinking he had secured funding to take Tesla private. Musk’s lie about the $25k Model 2 project stopped a decline in TSLA stock, which had slid by 6% so far that day, and the stock recovered partially by the end of the day. Given the market-moving nature of the statement, and the subject matter of being about Tesla’s future plans, it was thought that this would be another clear violation of Musk’s settlement with the SEC. Musk has a long history of taking umbrage with the press and government regulators, and getting in public fights with people for the smallest of slights. These attacks are often immature, as in the examples of his lewd statements about the SEC, or an unnecessary attack on a diver during a rescue operation. Reuters has been one of his main targets, but he has generally shown disdain for the media, and this attitude isn’t new. In 2018, he floated the idea of creating a website to rank “truth” in media, proposing the name “Pravduh.” The idea came after a series of negative reports about Tesla, making it clear that the effort was less about truth, and more about Musk feeling slighted about recent coverage. In a similar vein to his attacks on Reuters, he and the Tesla board recently denied a WSJ report that they were seeking a replacement for Musk as CEO. Musk responded personally, stating that it was an “EXTREMELY BAD BREACH OF ETHICS” for WSJ to publish a “DELIBERATELY FALSE ARTICLE and fail to include an unequivocal denial,” even though WSJ reached out to Tesla and was given no comment beforehand. One of the reasons WSJ couldn’t get comment beforehand is because Tesla dissolved its PR department years ago. Companies keep PR departments so that press can have a clear a consistent idea of a company’s position on the matter, and so that journalists can reach out to the company for comment beforehand. Musk’s anger at WSJ for not including a denial from a department that he himself dissolved suggests that perhaps he relishes the opportunity to strike out against the media, as his own actions have been responsible for the lack of communication between Tesla and the media. At this point everyone knows his reputation except for people that choose to believe what he says. The sales numbers have been dismal in Europe, China, and here in the US but he speaks as though everything is okay and everyone is having issues. The numbers tell a different story but at the rate things are going we will have to see how long the truth evades him. He even targeted us here at Electrek after we published a true and fair article critiquing Tesla’s plan to charge owners $1,500 for hardware they already bought. After our report, many other media reported the same story, and a few days later Tesla lowered the price to $1,000 (when it still should be zero, and at least one owner has prevailed in small claims due to our report). Immediately after Tesla lowered the price of the upgrade, we found that Elon Musk had blocked our site’s account on Twitter, and also blocked my colleague Fred Lambert, who was not involved in reporting the story. We were also banned from future Tesla events due to our true and fair report. If you’re considering going solar, it’s always a good idea to get quotes from a few installers.

    "content": "Transport Canada is looking into Tesla after it made a suspicious number of rebate requests on the last days of the Canadian EV incentive program. A single dealership in Quebec would have delivered about 4,000 vehicles in a single weekend, which is physically impossible. The Canadian government announced in January that it was running out of money for its up to $5,000 incentive program for the purchase of electric vehicles. It was supposed to end in March, but in mid-January, the government started to warn consumers and dealers that money was running faster than planned and that it would need to end it by the end of January. Unsurprisingly, it created a rush for people to take delivery by the end of the month. Tesla is the most popular electric vehicle brand in Canada, so it’s not surprising that it benefited most from the temporary surge in demand. However, now that the numbers are coming in, some are becoming suspicious of some of the numbers Tesla is claiming. According to a report from the Toronto Star, four Tesla locations claimed to have sold 8,653 electric vehicles in the last three days of the rebate. They filed for $43.1 million in rebates — more than half of the $71.8 million in remaining funds. Tesla’s location in Quebec City alone filed more than 2,500 rebates in a single day and 4,000 over the weekend. Considering the location can hold only a few hundred cars and that the company needs to have delivered the vehicle to file the rebate, people are suspicious that Tesla could have actually delivered the cars when it says it did. The suspicious surge in filings from Tesla has resulted in other dealers being stuck without rebates. The Canadian Automobile Dealers Association (CADA) surveyed its dealers, and it found that they are stuck with 2,295 unreimbursed rebates worth about $10 million. CADA spokesperson Huw Williams commented on the situation: “These dealers in good faith gave customers the money for a program that is always refunded. They shouldn’t be left making a payment on behalf of the Government of Canada.” CADA has been pleading its case with Ottawa for the last few weeks and it is now going public through the Toronto Star report to put pressure. Following the report, Transport Canada is reportedly looking into the situation. They wrote to CADA: “This report is unacceptable and I am asking the department that is responsible for administering this program to provide me with detailed and complete information.” Williams claimed that “Tesla gamed the system.” Terry Budd, who owns 8 dealerships in Ontario, also doesn’t believe Tesla could have delivered that many vehicles: “There’s no way they delivered or sold that many cars in a weekend. They cleared everyone else out.” The Canadian dealers are still waiting to see if they will be reimbursed on the roughly 2,000 EVs that they delivered. Anyone who thinks Musk wouldn't commit fraud against the Canadian government, or elsewhere, hasn't been paying attention. A person without ethics or morals who knows there will be no consequences for illegal or unethical actions has no qualms about committing them. It will be the Canadian Tesla employees who were forced to commit the fraud, if it can proven, who will unfortunately be the only ones to suffer consequences. Tesla was obviously going to be the one to deliver the most EVs amid the surge to take advantage of the incentive. There’s no doubt about that. The automaker is also used to delivery rushes, which generally happen at the end of quarters, but it can certainly muster up more capacity at the end of January also. However, I have to admit that I also found those numbers suspicious. 2,500 vehicles in a single day and 4,000 in a weekend at Tesla’s single location in Quebec City? It makes no sense. Maybe Tesla delivered more vehicles in the last few weeks and filed the rebates in big batches, but even then, it would raise eyebrows. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

    "content": "Not even three months ago, convicted felon Donald Trump and his largest funder, ketamine-fueled Tesla CEO Elon Musk, appeared together on the White House lawn, improperly using government resources to do a low-budget ad to help Tesla get out of the sales ditch that Musk has dug for it. Now, amidst an explosive feud between the two narcissists that came to a head yesterday, it’s being reported that Mr. Trump wants to sell the object of that ad: his red Tesla Model S. Tesla is going through a rough time in sales right now, and it’s largely related to CEO Elon Musk’s political activities. He gave hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to anti-EV candidate Donald Trump, becoming his top funder, and Mr. Trump and his republican party have gone on to make many anti-environment and anti-EV moves in the months since they’ve seized power. Musk himself spent the last few months working in an advisory position in the White House, which was dubbed the “Department of Government Efficiency,” despite it not being a real government department and having a supposed mission redundant with the already-existing Government Accountability Office. During his time, he adopted a slash-and-burn ethos of cutting small but effective government programs (and, mostly, lying about how much those programs cost). He also interfered in their normal activities, making government less efficient, not more. It’s expected that the cuts recommended by Musk’s advisory board could end up costing Americans billions of dollars in the long term. Musk’s political advocacy has also included support for German neo-Nazis, agreeing with a defense of Hitler’s actions in the Holocaust, and many other white supremacist statements. Unsurprisingly, this has driven protests against the company, embarrassed owners and pushed many customers away – and those protesters aren’t planning on stopping even now that Musk has left his advisory position. Amidst all this chaos Musk brought to his company through his ill-considered political activities, there was a thought to forestall the sales decline by doing a Tesla ad on the White House lawn, alongside Mr. Trump. Press was invited, and the two parked a few Teslas in the driveway while Mr. Trump hawked Musk’s products, reading from a script and his notes on unit pricing and the availability of features like full self-driving. The “ad” had several funny moments (including the most humorous line, “everything’s computer!”), as parodized by The Daily Show in this spot for the “White House Auto Mall” A post shared by The Daily Show (@thedailyshow) It was a strange moment for plenty of reasons, not least of which is because Tesla does not do traditional advertising placements, instead preferring to focus on other forms of marketing. It had considered starting to do ads, but Musk fired the nascent ad team last year. This, too, was not a traditional advertisement, but it did reek of desperation. It turns out the ad didn’t really work – soon afterwards, we checked Tesla’s inventory numbers and didn’t see a big spike in orders. And now, it’s being reported that the vehicle which Mr. Trump said he “loved” (er, excuse me, he said he loves “Tesler,” not “Tesla”) is for sale. Several outlets reported today that a White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Trump has decided to sell the car. And a White House official told USA Today that Mr. Trump has no plans to have further contact with Musk. Mr. Trump hadn’t actually used the car to drive, as he is disallowed from driving by the Secret Service, but staff could use the vehicle. And it’s supposedly not the first Tesla Mr. Trump has owned – he is rumored to have once owned an original Tesla Roadster, which he also didn’t drive (I’m a Roadster owner, and let’s just say I doubt Mr. Trump would fit in this car). I got this before Elon revealed I was on Epstein island The news of Mr. Trump’s buyer’s remorse comes not even 24 hours after a very public spat over the republicans’ wasteful budget bill, which saw Mr. Trump threatening to stop paying for SpaceX’s services and Musk accusing Mr. Trump of being on Jeffrey Epstein’s list. Musk had previously said he loved Mr. Trump “as much as a straight man can,” despite apparently knowing of his presence on said list. The spat resulted in a significant drop in TSLA’s stock price, which recovered partially today. But it could lead to a lot more trouble for Tesla, and we at Electrek went through the possible negative effects for Tesla here. As of now, the car remains parked at the White House.

    "content": "Tesla just dropped its Q1 2025 earnings and the news isn’t great, as sales and profits have fallen significantly and missed already-low expectations. And in the earnings report, the company has issued what seems to be an admission that its own CEO’s actions are to blame. It’s been a rough time for Tesla employees lately. The company’s mission is an admirable one: to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable transportation. Many employees joined the company with that mission in mind, wanting to do something positive for the world. But in recent times, the highest-profile employee of the company, its CEO and largest individual shareholder Elon Musk, has moved away from that mission. He spent huge sums from his personal wealth to campaign for an anti-EV political candidate, and is now actively participating in politics as an ally to those anti-EV forces and spreading climate misinformation along the way. He’s also famously vindictive and Tesla’s board refuses to rein him in as he works to destroy the company. So what is a Tesla employee to do, in this case? On the one hand, they want to do what’s right for the company. On the other hand, they don’t want to attract the ire of their boss who wants to do what’s wrong for the company. When your livelihood is at stake, sometimes you’ll choose to just keep your head down, keep working the best you can, and hope in vain that at some point the CEO might change his mind and stop acting like an idiot, or the board might finally step in for the good of the company. (Or, alternately, if you have other options, you might quit to make a statement, like many executives have) However, we’ve seen some instances of some Tesla employees trying to do something, anything, to cry out to the world that all of this isn’t normal. And one example of that comes from Tesla’s earnings report today. It’s right there in the third paragraph of the summary at the beginning of the document: Uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers. This sort of statement is not a surprise to see in a quarterly report in the environment we’re currently in. The US stock market and economy as a whole are showing increasingly worrying signs, almost entirely due to the flailing actions of the ignoramuses who somehow find themselves in the Oval Office (despite that there exists a clear legal remedy stopping insurrectionists from holding office in the US). These actions have included the announcement of several tariffs (even though that is the purview of Congress), seemingly determined randomly through a dumb formula that didn’t even use the right numbers, and which seem to change every day (as one would expect when the person implementing them is senile and was profoundly stupid even before he went senile). This idiotic flailing has produced the expected response: retaliatory tariffs, distrust from the international community, less availability of goods domestically, chaos among the business community, and pushing nations we consider as our rivals closer to the rest of the world. Businesses, on the whole, have tried to stick to factual statements in their earnings reports and business forecasts. But despite that these statements are generally dry, the message remains clear: tariffs will increase costs for everyone and make business more difficult. And Tesla’s statement is similarly dry, pointing to the uncertainty of ever-changing tariff decisions and how they will affect supply chains and cost. This is especially true for Tesla Energy, which will be affected much more than its car business, as Tesla also acknowledged today, stating “the current tariff landscape will have a relatively larger impact on our Energy business compared to automotive.” But for Tesla, this is still exceptional given that the company’s moonlighting CEO, who spends little time working on Tesla business and is otherwise occupied with his twitter addiction, stealing Tesla resources for his private AI company, and trying to shut down the Environmental Protection Agency. Along with all this, Musk is also an advisor in the very administration that is making Tesla’s business difficult. Musk has stated his opposition to tariffs, but he himself has to walk a thin line and occasionally downplay his language, given his self-professed “love” for Mr. Trump. And, despite this supposed opposition, he still remains one of the largest financial backers of the tariff advocate in question. But tariffs aren’t the only thing that will make Tesla’s business difficult, as Tesla acknowledged today in its letter. It continued to say: This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term. Again, a rather dry statement elucidating a very significant problem with the company at the moment. It’s not so much that political sentiment about EVs is changing, as EV sales continue to grow globally, despite headlines falsely suggesting otherwise. It’s sentiment against Tesla that is changing, largely due to Musk’s involvement in politics. The main driver of Tesla’s recent sales decline has been Musk’s high-profile political advocacy, which has included support for German neo-Nazis and agreeing with a defense of Hitler’s actions in the Holocaust, among many other white supremacist statements. This has driven protests against the company, embarrassed owners and pushed many customers away. It shouldn’t have to be said that allying a company’s brand with neo-Nazis is a bad political decision, especially so if you, as an individual, are so tied to the brand. In fact, this is something that Tesla acknowledged very early in its existence, as the company used to make a very intentional effort not to make EVs political, hoping to be able to sell to as broad of an audience as possible. Musk seems to have forgotten that directive sometime during his ongoing twitter addiction (an addiction so bad that he has now overpaid for the company not once, but twice). But this isn’t the first time Tesla has had to call out its own CEO’s actions. As the Musk problem has continued to get worse, Tesla has said similar things multiple times in recent months. In March, Tesla’s policy team sent a letter to the US Trade Representative urging the USTR to “consider the downstream impacts” of proposed actions. One of those downstream impacts includes retaliatory tariffs, and given the high profile nature of the attachment between Tesla’s CEO and another social media addicted clown who’s implementing said tariffs, there was a lot of talk about Tesla becoming target of those tariffs. He can try to blame things like the tariffs - but fundamentally - Musk made bad business decisions from the Cybertruck design to the Robotaxi instead of a low cost EV. He has consistently gone against staff recommendations that were based upon a business case analysis. It's time for him to go. And sure enough, Tesla has seen other governments retaliate against it. Canada has removed Tesla from some incentive programs and is investigating Tesla’s sudden incentive cash grab. The UK, one of the few territories where Tesla sales are not down, has also considered removing the company from incentive programs. Tesla has also had to walk a thin line on EV incentives, stating that it supports killing EV incentives in the US because Musk said so (even though that would harm the company), while still lobbying for EV incentives overseas where the Musk/Trump stink isn’t overpowering the conversation. So, in the end, it seems like a really tough time to be a Tesla employee. The company knows that its CEO is harming it, but the board won’t do anything about it, and speaking up too forcefully can get you fired.

    "content": "Tesla’s earnings report dropped today, and news isn’t great. But instead of recognizing his failures that have led to Tesla’s downturn, CEO Elon Musk lashed out with conspiracy theories while also hypocritically failing to acknowledge that his company was only profitable this quarter due to regulatory credits. The numbers are in on Tesla’s dismal quarter, with sales, profits and margins tanking significantly for the company despite a rising global EV market. You’d expect a drop in car sales to be top of mind for a car company, but instead of talking about this, CEO Elon Musk opened the call by talking about his ineffective advisory role to a former reality TV host. Musk is heading up the self-styled “Department of Government Efficiency,” an advisory group that is focused on reducing redundancy in government. The office is not an actual government department and has a redundant mission to the Government Accountability Office, which is an actual government department focused on reducing government waste. Musk originally claimed that the department would be able to save $2 trillion for the US government, which is actually impossible because federal discretionary spending is $1.7 trillion, which is a (gets out abacus) smaller number than $2 trillion. He has, of course, failed at this task that anyone with any level of competence would have known was impossible before setting it out for themselves, and now projects that the department will save $150 billion next year, less than a tenth of his original estimate. But even that projection is likely an overstatement, given that most of the supposed savings that DOGE has found are not actual savings at all. On top of this, the US government’s deficit has grown to the second-highest level on record – with the first happening in 2020, the last time Mr. Trump squatted in the White House. Which means the government isn’t saving money, it is in fact borrowing and spending more of it than ever before. So, Musk’s tenure in the advisory board has been an unmitigated failure by any realistic account. But if you listened to Tesla’s call, you wouldn’t have known this, as Musk was quite boastful of his efforts – starting a Tesla conference call with an irrelevant rant about his fake government department, instead of with Tesla business. He claimed that he has made “a lot of progress in addressing waste and fraud” and that the job is “mostly done,” which is not correct by his own metrics. Musk stated that his purpose is “trying to bring in the insane deficit that is leading our country, the United States, to destruction,” and as we covered above, that deficit has only increased. But he also went on to spew some rather insane conspiracy theories about the reasons behind his company’s recent failures, all of which of course put the blame on someone else, rather than himself. The buck stops anywhere but here, I guess. His primary assertion was that the “blowback from the time I’ve been spending in government” (which, again, is an advisory role, not an actual government position) has come mainly from protesters that were “receiving fraudulent money” and are now angry that the government money spigot has been turned off. Which, of course, he’s provided no evidence for… and he’s provided no evidence for it because it’s false. Besides, that’s not how protests work. But incorrect claims that protests do work that way are often used by opponents of free speech, with the motivation of putting a chilling effect public participation. Fitting behavior for an enemy of the First Amendment like Elon Musk. Meanwhile, this assertion also comes from a person who tried and failed to bribe voters to win an election. Perhaps his admiration of Tesla protesters is aspirational – he wishes his ideas were good enough to inspire that sort of grassroots political effort that money, demonstrably, cannot buy. But this hypocrisy extends beyond Musk’s hatred of free expression, and strikes at the heart of the business he is the titular leader of, Tesla, the organization that has made him into the richest man in the world. Because not only is it not true that Tesla protests are caused by people losing money from his ineffective government actions (they are, in fact, driven by him doing Nazi stuff all the time), it’s also objectively true that Musk’s companies are a large recipient of government money. And that’s particularly relevant today, to the very earnings call where Musk made his ridiculous assertion, because in Q1 2025, Tesla only turned a profit due to government credits. Without them, it would have lost money. Per today’s earnings report, Tesla earned $595 million in regulatory credits in Q1. But its total net income for the quarter was $409 million. This means that without those regulatory credits, Tesla would have posted a -$189 million loss in Q1. It was saved not just by credit sales, but credit sales which increased year over year – in the year-ago quarter, Tesla made $442 million in regulatory credits, despite having higher sales in Q1 2024 than in Q1 2025. So not only were credits higher, but credits per vehicle were higher. This is a common feature of Tesla earnings, and we even said in our earnings preview that we expected it. While Tesla had a bad quarter, nobody expected it to become actually unprofitable, because there was always the possibility of increasing regulatory credit sales to eke out a profitable quarter. And this has been the case many times in Tesla’s past, as well. In earlier times, Tesla’s first few profitable quarters were decried by the company’s opponents as an accounting trick, suggesting that regulatory credit sales weren’t “real” profits, and that the cars should have to stand on their own. This is a silly thing to say – businesses do business in the environment that exists, and every business has an incentive structure that includes subsidies and externalities. If we were to selectively write off certain profits for certain businesses, we could make a tortured case that any business isn’t profitable. Plus, these opponents didn’t extend the same treatment to the oil industry, which is subsidized to the tune of $760 billion per year in the US alone in unpriced externalities, yet that is somehow never mentioned during their earnings calls. Correct me if I am wrong but the main regulatory credits that Tesla makes money on are the EU carbon credits and the California CARB ZEV credits. So the only reason Tesla was still profitable was because of the generosity of two entities that Elon now hates: The EU and California. Musk has even claimed, probably correctly, that if all subsidies were eliminated both for EVs and for oil & gas, that EVs would come out ahead compared to the status quo (more recently, Musk has become one of the biggest funders of anti-EV forces, allying himself with a bought-and-paid oil stooge who is giving even more preferential treatment to the oil industry). But, setting aside the debate over whether credits are valid profits (they are), for years now we’ve been well beyond Tesla’s reliance on credits. The company has produced significant profits, regardless of credit sales, for some time now. At least, until today. That’s no longer true – Tesla did rely on credits to become profitable in Q1. And Musk starting the call with a ridiculous rant about government handouts not only shows his hypocrisy and projection on this matter, but his detachment from reality itself. He is, truly, too stuck in the impenetrable echo chamber of his self-congratulating twitter feed to realize what an embarrassment he’s being in public – to the point of inventing shadow enemies to explain the very real, very simple explanation that people aren’t buying his company’s cars because he sucks so much.

    "content": "What? You don’t know Slate? Okay, neither did we until a couple of weeks ago, and to be honest, we still don’t know much at this point. We’ve learned that Slate is a new US company focused on EV technology that appears to be gearing up for something big—just as soon as it steps out from behind the curtain of a clandestine website and divulges what it’s actually working on. Here’s what we know. Since this new automaker(?) was seemingly founded relatively recently, there isn’t much background to share because, well, it doesn’t have a history… yet. According to Slate Auto’s LinkedIn page, which was verified on March 5, 2025, it is a motor vehicle manufacturer based in Troy, Michigan, that is “exploring opportunities in the electric vehicle space.” Despite its infancy, the page states Slate has already established a team of 200 to 500 employees and has 46 additional roles currently listed as seeking hire. Many of those roles are administrative, but some, such as plant manager and suspension engineer, hint that Slate is working on EVs… or at least one EV. Whether that means Slate is planning to emerge from the internet mire as a bonafide new American EV brand, or sell its tech to other OEMs remains unknown, but there are plenty more answers on its newly published website. While I applaud Slate’s creative and clandestine approach to teasing “mold-breaking” EV technology, they aren’t giving me much to work with as a journalist. That’s fine, Slate; keep your secrets… for now. I’ll be the guy shaking the fence outside 2716 Daley Dr, Troy, Michigan 48083, screaming, “LET ME IN!” like Eric Andre. That’s right. I know where you work (thanks to LinkedIn). Follow the money! SLATE is just an anagram for TESLA. After being intrigued by word of a new company in Michigan recruiting a team from other US automakers, I signed up for Slate’s updates in hopes of learning more. This young company should sell carrots because it already has a knack for dangling them in front of the public. The site uses playfully vague phrases like “the next generation of innovation in the industry.” What industry, you ask? Well, that’s simple, “The [REDACTED] industry.” From LinkedIn, we’ve gathered Slate’s presence will be in the EV industry, but its role and capacity remain huge question marks. So, what is Slate exactly? I’m sorry to inform you that even after off-the-record conversations with industry veterans, we still don’t quite know. But it’s something, and that’s exciting for now. We will all learn more in less than a month, as the very bottom of Slate’s website has a countdown, which, by my (awful) math, points to April 24 or so for a full reveal. I’ll be staring at this countdown for the next 26+ days to make sure I don’t miss anything new. You can circle back with Electrek in late April for the full scoop, though.

    "content": "The McDermitt Caldera is an extinct supervolcano on the Oregon-Nevada border that, depending on who you believe, is loaded with enough lithium to power 600 million electric cars. It begs the question: who will control the $1.5 trillion dollar mineral deposit? Located at the southern end of the McDermitt Caldera, in Humboldt County, Nevada, the lithium (Li) deposit at Thacker Pass is believed to have estimated reserves of approximately 1.3 million tons of Li carbonate equivalent. That’s enough of the treasured material, on its own, to redraw world’s energy map. Recent calculations by Castor and Henry estimate an in situ tonnage of ~20 to 40 MT of Li (maximum 120 MT of Li) to be contained within sediments of the whole McDermitt caldera … even if this estimation is high due to variations in sediment thickness and/or Li grade, the Li inventory contained in McDermitt caldera sediments would still be on par with, if not considerably larger than, the 10.2 MT of Li inventory estimated to be contained in brines beneath the Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia, previously considered the largest Li deposit on Earth. Spanish-language site Motorpasión reports that the McDermitt Caldera deposit packs enough lithium to produce a staggering 600 million electric cars, and could make the US (with the right policies in place) a global leader in the li-ion battery supply chain. So, of course, America’s biggest EV oligarchs are going to fight over it. Pickup trucks are big business in the US and, frankly, everywhere else — and both Musk and Bezos are hoping to get into that business in a big way, through the Tesla CEO’s Cybertruck, its (supposedly) less polarizing successor, and the upcoming low-cost Slate backed by the Amazon founder. And that doesn’t include GM (who have been arguing over the rights to the caldera for years already), Ford, Rivian (where Bezos, through Amazon, holds more than 13% of the shareholders’ vote), and others. For both of them, controlling the caldera means more than money. It means securing control of one of the most strategic mineral sectors of this century. And, in late 2024 with the Trump-Musk bromance in full bloom, Musk publicly pushed mining operations to produce more nickel for EVs, invested in a massive lithium refinery in Texas, and promised even more EV production, making it look like Musk, through his political influence, might soon be granted control of the world’s largest lithium deposit. “Elon’s always been there, now the megaphone is bigger,” one lithium producer, who was granted anonymity to speak freely, told Politico. “This is a pretty small space, so he’s always had a lot of truck.” Then in June, the Trump-Musk bromance collapsed in dramatic fashion, with Musk launching a now-deleted tweet on X accusing the President of being “in the Epstein files,” launching a political controversy that is still gnawing at Trump. With Musk’s political influence largely spent as he starts his own America Party to “primary” sitting republicans who voted against his interests, that opens the door for others to start looking into American mineral rights — and Bezos, through his AI‑driven exploration startup KoBold Metals (which recently spent $1 billion to expand its footprint into the Democratic Republic of the Congo after inking a framework deal to buy AVZ Mineral’s stake in the Manono hard rock lithium deposit there), is perfectly placed to capitalize on that opportunity. And, if there’s one thing guys like Jeff Bezos do well, it’s capitalize on an opportunity … and I wouldn’t expect him to happily send all that lithium he’s mining to Elon’s refinery, either.

    "content": "Tesla’s brand loyalty levels dropped from the best in the industry to fairly middling results, according to new data from S&P Global Mobility, and it’s all because of the company’s CEO, Elon Musk. S&P Global Mobility tracks sales data across the automotive industry, and its new customer loyalty numbers are out, shared with Reuters this morning. The numbers show a troubling trend for Tesla, and a historic drop in customer loyalty for the brand that long held the #1 title in that space. S&P’s data shows that Tesla’s customer loyalty took a “nosedive” in July 2024, timed alongside Musk’s public commitment of hundreds of millions of dollars to the anti-environment political campaign of a convicted felon who had promised to do his best to destroy the EV industry (and who is Constitutionally barred from holding office in the US). And it continued to decline as his relationship deepened with the same candidate. According to the Reuters story, S&P’s numbers show that Tesla customer loyalty peaked at 73% in June 2024, but took a “nosedive” in the next month, and ended up bottoming out in March at 49.9%. That means about a third of Tesla owners who would have bought another Tesla decided to buy another brand as well. S&P’s data is not based on surveys, but rather household-level data of which cars each household is buying. Tesla’s loyalty since recovered to 57.4% in May, the most recent month included in the S&P data, still far less than its previous peak. As can be seen in the graph above, Tesla was in a league of its own consistently. There were only single months where any other brand might have matched Tesla’s brand loyalty numbers over the course of the last several years – and this held true consistently in the period before S&P’s chart as well, as we at Electrek have covered many times in the past. The drop from 73% to 49.9% even put Tesla briefly below the industry average, something which the company has never seen before. Even after recovery, Tesla is no longer in its first-place-by-a-long-shot position, and now behind Chevy and Ford and about the same level as Toyota. Tom Libby, an analyst with S&P, was quoted by Reuters as saying he’s “never seen this rapid of a decline in such a short period of time.” Another metric, customer defections, also showed trouble for Tesla. Customer defections show how many more households are switching from another brand to buy your brand, compared to the number of households switching from your brand to another. Tesla’s customer defection numbers were “in a different stratosphere” to the rest of the industry for a long period of time. From 2020-2024, Tesla on average acquired five times more customers than it lost to other brands. The next-highest performers were Genesis at 2.8 and Kia/Hyundai at 1.5/1.4. It makes sense that Tesla would gain more customers than it loses, given that it was and is a relatively new and growing brand. If people are switching to an EV, there’s a good chance they’ll switch to a Tesla since that’s the most well-known EV brand and is widely available. But Tesla’s numbers were really high. But since July 2024, the defections have dropped significantly. Now, Tesla is below 2, a more than 60% drop in its defection rate, and putting it back in touch with the rest of the industry. Further, it has been eclipsed by other brands – and not just startup EV brands who have the advantage of being new and thus naturally having a high conquest rate. Rivian, Polestar, Porsche and Cadillac all now exceed Tesla’s defection rate. These poor results track alongside Tesla’s recent sales results, which have been dropping in just about every territory, even doing damage to the entire EV market as a result. Today’s results, and Tesla’s recent poor earnings, spell trouble for Tesla, showing how Musk’s influence are damaging the high-flying company, which has always been treated as an exception in the industry (and in the stock market) due to its exceptional results across several customer and growth metrics. Now, Tesla’s results are no longer exceptional – or rather, they’re exceptional in the opposite direction, with Tesla being one of few EV brands with falling sales in a rising global EV market. But despite the trouble all of this spells for Tesla, it seems like it’s not spelling trouble for Musk himself. Even though he’s the reason that Tesla is crashing in the first place, the Tesla board just rewarded him with $26 billion today – a payday with more money for a single bad employee than Tesla has made in any year over its entire history, even as Tesla’s profits have been drastically declining this year as a result of Musk’s actions. We’ve previously covered how embarrassed owners have been modifying their cars with bumper stickers or badges to separate themselves from the image that Musk has built for the company. But now we have data showing just how many of them have stopped buying Teslas. And it’s not just affecting prospective customers, but the customers who know how good the company’s cars are, and who had previously returned to buying Teslas in industry-leading numbers, and yet can’t stomach coming back because Musk is just so comically bad. It would be interesting to see more from the graph above. We’re betting the numbers before Jan 2022 might have been even higher, as Musk’s public advocacy had already taken a turn towards the bizarre as he fell deeper into his twitter addiction. But it’s clear what the biggest catalyst is – Musk’s ill-considered idea to give hundreds of millions of dollars to one of the dumbest people on the planet – someone who Musk himself had previously correctly said was “not good for America or the world.” To be clear, Musk has always been relatively outspoken. But there were times where he was able to limit his advocacy to some more reasonable positions, stay somewhat more on message about the importance of fighting climate change (not anymore…), and stay out of the more obviously partisan political nonsense. General wisdom does state that CEOs shouldn’t be too divisive, because dividing your customer base will only lead to a smaller addressable market. Surprise, it turns out that general wisdom is right. Musk’s political advocacy has included support for German neo-Nazis, agreeing with a defense of Hitler’s actions in the Holocaust, and many other white supremacist statements, along with his well-publicized public nazi salutes. Then, Musk joined an advisory position where he spent his days finding ways to increase (not decrease) the country’s budget deficit, violate laws, and kill literally millions of people. It should be a surprise to nobody (who isn’t deep in a twitter echo chamber that he himself devised) that all of this drove protests against the company and caused incredible damage to the Tesla brand which Musk has attached his public persona to. And I would contend that supporting white supremacists is stupid in itself, but doing so publicly when you lead a company that relies on a good public perception, all while supporting someone whose stated goal is to destroy your industry, is particularly stupid. But his stupidity hasn’t just been limited to politics, but also to purely business decisions. And we can see how stupid it all is with the effect it has all had on Tesla’s sales results. I'm curious how much the slight recovery in April is on account of a lot of the people who used to buy Tesla being so disgusted by Musk's behavior that they sold their cars and thus no longer are counted in brand loyalty tracking like this. I know quite a few people like that. It would be interesting to see what happened in the intervening months, given the public breakup between Musk and Mr. Trump – though Musk has since apologized for his outburst (even though what he said was true), and Musk has continued to spread racist nonsense in the meantime. Protests are still ongoing and sales are still dropping, so the public seems to have a memory of Musk’s ridiculousness, even if he’s gotten slightly more quiet in recent weeks. It would also be interesting to see how much different the results would be if there were more great EVs available in the US at good prices. EVs from other brands are getting better, but Tesla still has both great cars and a well-considered ecosystem around them, and $299/mo for a Model 3 is hard to beat. If there were more mass-market EV-focused challengers (like the upcoming Rivian R2/R3, a non-tariff-affected Volvo EX30, any of the myriad Chinese options available overseas, etc.), we think Tesla’s loyalty results might be even less resilient than they are.

    "content": "Tesla has sent a response to Transport Canada about its sudden incentive cash grab from March, stating that this is standard process and suggesting that the incentives were for backdated sales that Tesla hadn’t filed yet. Until recently, Canada had a $5,000 incentive for electric vehicle purchases, similar to the US $7,500 federal incentive from Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. That ended earlier this year, though as the incentive program ran out of money more quickly than expected, and it didn’t look like the government was going to refill the program anytime soon. Canada is also currently going through a contentious federal election process, so it was unlikely for its government to move on refilling this incentive while things are shaken up. So, the government communicated in January that the program would run out of money soon – very soon – giving dealers only a few days to claim incentives. Then in March, it was reported by the Toronto Star that something suspicious had happened with Tesla, as it had filed for 8,653 EV sales within the last 72 hours of the Canadian rebate incentive, an abnormally high number. One Tesla locations in particular, Quebec City, claimed 4,000 rebates over the course of a weekend, which is physically impossible for a location of that size, and represents about a ~20x spike in daily deliveries for the location. Another location in Etobicoke reportedly claimed 2,528 rebates over the weekend, which is more than all the rebates that location had previously claimed combined. The alarm was raised by the Canadian Auto Dealers Association, which said its dealers as a whole had been left out of around $10 million in rebates representing 2,295 cars. Dealerships claimed that “Tesla gamed the system” and that “they cleared everyone else out.” As a result of this, on March 25 Tesla had $43 million in rebates frozen as the government investigated what went on with this sudden spike in incentive filings. Fast forward to now, and Tesla Canada has responded to the back-and-forth claiming that it didn’t do anything weird, simply filed a number of backlogged applications, as is normal for the program. In a letter dated March 28 obtained by Electrek, Fereshteh Zeineddin, Tesla’s director of sales and service for Canada, says that Tesla’s filings were normal and that Transport Canada, the government office responsible for administering the incentive program, should know better. The incentive is structured such that a dealership can offer a discount upfront to customers, then get reimbursed later by the government after filing for that incentive. Which Tesla points out means these are not grants to Tesla, but rather grants to Canadian customers which are then handled by Tesla. Tesla claims that backlogged filings have always been allowed, and says that it has always complied with program rules and has had good standing with the Canadian government as a result. However, Tesla does not specifically state in the letter how many of its weekend filings were for backdated sales. Tesla says it was “shocked” that it didn’t hear about the incentive investigation directly from the government, and instead had to learn about it through the media. It suggests that it might pursue legal action if payments aren’t resumed, though that it does understand that it may not get payments for every delivery depending on program funding. Finally, Tesla plays the victim in the letter, saying that as a result of Transport Canada’s investigation into these incentive filings, Tesla employees have suffered negative public perception and are increasingly facing harassment and verbal abuse by Canadians. We’re still skeptical of Tesla’s incentive claims, even after reading the letter. The thousands of incentives filed over the course of one weekend would represent several months of incentive backlog. While disorganization is nothing new for Tesla, it still does seem questionable that Tesla’s 1,400-employee Canadian subsidiary would ignore tens of millions of dollars of revenue for several months. And complaints about a lack of communication from the government could fall under that same umbrella – if Tesla is truly disorganized enough to leave these tens of millions on the table for months (an odd move for a company whose CEO claims to be so interested in “efficiency”), maybe they’re also disorganized enough not to receive communication from the government regarding the incentive program. Tesla does, after all, have no communications department and recently lost its head of policy who had previously been acting as an impromptu communications department on twitter. Instead, Tesla now uses the twitter feed of its CEO as its primary form of communication, but he’s apparently too busy literally defending Hitler instead of managing the company that made him the vast majority of the wealth that he is now channeling into anti-EV entities. So, surely the reason for Tesla’s negative public perception in Canada is all because of this Transport Canada investigation, and it couldn’t possibly have any other source… right? Tesla’s policy personnel and overseas employees are definitely having to walk a thin line right now, and this seems like another example of that. Currently, public perception of the company is down specifically because of its CEO, Elon Musk, who seems determined to embarrass himself in public every day and bring his company down with him. He’s attached his own persona to Tesla so loudly and publicly over its existence that the two are inextricable in the minds of many – we even quite often hear people refer to Tesla, a company that has over a hundred thousand employees, as “he,” rather than the proper “it” or “they,” with people using Elon Musk himself as synecdoche for the entire company (which he barely does any work at). But Tesla employees can’t say that, because it is also well known that Musk has a vindictive management style, and that anything that is even perceived as a lack of support can result in retaliation (remember when we were blocked by a so-called first amendment lover for protecting his customers?). So they’re having to walk a thin line right now – advocating for Tesla’s interests without pointing out the elephant in the room, which is that the company is being run by an idiot who is determined to run it into the ground while also doing all he can to spread white supremacy around the globe. More specifically, Canadian public perception of Tesla is down more than most due to Musk’s close association with convicted felon Donald Trump, who recently wandered back into the Oval Office (despite that there exists a clear legal remedy for insurrectionists), and who has been working to shatter the close friendship between US and Canada by restricting the free trade of goods across the longest border in the world. Tesla knows this, as it submitted a letter to the US Trade Representative stating that Tesla could become target of retaliatory tariffs, and it already has. This incentive pause is one of those examples. Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s transport minister, specifically mentioned the illegal tariffs imposed upon Canada as part of the government’s skepticism about these incentives: No payments will be made until we are confident that the claims are valid. I also directed my department to change the eligibility criteria for future iZEV programs to ensure that Tesla vehicles will not be eligible for incentives so long as the illegitimate and illegal U.S. tariffs are imposed against Canada. That’s not the only Canadian government representative who has made a similar statement about Tesla. When British Columbia Energy Minister Adrian Dix recently removed Tesla products from a charging incentive rebate program, he stated: I thought they shouldn’t be made available on a public subsidy program right now. I don’t think anyone in British Columbia needs to be told why, and I think most people would support their removal from that list. It’s ironic that Tesla’s incentive grab was pointed out by the Canadian dealer lobby. Dealer lobbies have long been the largest legal thorn in Tesla’s side, even moreso than the oil industry – while oil has done its fair share of propaganda to discredit electric cars, dealer lobbies have been responsible for stopping Tesla’s ability to sell in several areas, specifically in the US and also around the world, due to Tesla’s direct sales model which threatens traditional auto dealers. I hope transport Canada or someone investigates it further. The backlog story doesn't make a lot of sense. Unless you were trying to game the system in some way and still doesn't make a lot of sense it's not like the other manufacturers can make people's buy their cars. Although I have seen some under 50mi 2025 Nissans available as used 1 owner that may be some kind of tax credit deal. The irony here is that Musk’s current political allies include auto dealerships, which are one of the most republican sectors in America. They are feeling more represented than ever on the federal level, which could lead to more trouble for Tesla’s sales model. Another irony lies in Tesla’s mention of the 1,400 Canadians employed by Tesla. While those employees, like most Tesla employees, are either just doing it as a job or are truly interested in advancing EVs, that number does pale in comparison to the thousands of Canadian job losses already caused by the administration that Elon Musk is the world’s biggest monetary and rhetorical supporter of. And while some employees might still care about the mission, Tesla’s CEO doesn’t. So spare us the crocodile tears on that one. So its clear that the “public perception” problem isn’t about one report, it’s about the one guy who we all know is the source of the public perception problem – and basically every other problem with Tesla right now.

    "content": "Tesla stock dropped over 50 points today, primarily in response to a very public feud between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and convicted felon Donald Trump. But, as we pointed out in November, this doesn’t have anything to do with company performance, and rather only reflects a change in the market’s expectation of potential benefit to Tesla from government corruption. Tesla stock has had a wild few months, with big rises and falls that has had little to do with company performance (which is, perhaps, nothing new for the stock, which has always been a speculative vehicle). Much of the movement of TSLA has been centered around CEO Elon Musk’s relationship with Donald Trump. Musk very publicly supported Mr. Trump’s run for president, giving hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to Mr. Trump’s campaign, despite the latter’s openly anti-EV positions (and despite that there exists a clear legal remedy stopping insurrectionists from holding office in the US). Musk even went on to spew climate denying nonsense alongside Mr. Trump during the campaign, and later said nothing when Mr. Trump declared his intent to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement, even though he previously opposed a similar move in 2017. This led to Musk being invited into an advisory role, which was dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency despite it not being a real government department, and having a supposed mission redundant with the already-existing Government Accountability Office. And in the immediate aftermath of the election, TSLA stock rose swiftly, purely because of expectations of corruption. But after that swift rise, it gradually fell as the reality of economy-destroying tariffs, anti-EV legislation, and Tesla’s brand perception problem due to Musk’s actions all became apparent. Despite Musk’s position as a top republican party donor, the party still seems more interested in catering to its traditional base in the fossil fuel industry. Despite some recovery from that big post election rise-and-drop, TSLA took another big hit today, and it’s all due to the current rift forming between these two egomaniacs. During his tenure in his advisory position, Musk claims to have saved the government hundreds of billions of dollars, but independent accounting has shown that it is in fact likely to increase the deficit, not decrease it. Nevertheless, it seems like Musk was fooled into believing his own propaganda, and into thinking that deficit reduction was ever a goal of Mr. Trump, despite that he previously oversaw the highest nominal deficit of any person in the history of the United States. At least, he believed that until now. In the last few days, after leaving his advisory position, Musk has loudly opposed the new republican budget bill, which he now correctly points out will add trillions of dollars to the US deficit (as any lucid person might have predicted from the party of waste). The criticism came to a head today, with Musk going through one of his patented tweetstorms, acting more like a jilted lover than a CEO in charge of a company that has many people’s retirement invested into it. There’s been a lot of back and forth, but over the course of the day, Musk has posted many statements about how dangerous the budget bill will be for the US debt and deficit. Mr. Trump responded, stating that Musk should have known these things before now, but that Musk is only acting this way because he cut the “EV mandate.” To be clear, the bill in question does not cut any EV mandate, as there was never an EV mandate to begin with, but it does cut EV tax credits which Tesla has gained more benefit from than any other company, though Tesla lobbied in support of these cuts. The bill does not cut support for oil and gas companies, which are orders of magnitude higher than the support EV companies get. In response to this, Musk claimed that he personally swung the election in favor of the republicans, and that Mr. Trump is showing “ingratitude” by not recognizing this fact. Mr. Trump responded by suggesting that the government could save money by terminating all of the subsidies and contracts for services with Musk’s various companies. To this, Musk said that he would immediately decommission the Dragon capsule, which has been the main spacecraft used by NASA to service the International Space Station. Then, Musk went on to state that a recession will happen in the second half of this year due to Mr. Trump’s position on tariffs, and also to accuse Mr. Trump of being on Jeffrey Epstein’s list (which is not the first time Musk has publicly accused someone of pedophilia, though it is the first time he’s said that about someone who he claimed to “love as much as any straight man can,” and knowingly worked alongside), and to agree with a call for his impeachment. The public rift seems to have shaken the stock market out of its stupor, as Tesla went down more than 50 points since the start of today. While nothing significant has changed for Tesla’s business today – it’s still suffering from falling sales in an otherwise rising market, and it still has a bad CEO – what has changed is the possibility of the company benefitting from corruption. As I stated during TSLA’s meteoric post-election rise, the stock price was merely a reflection of the market’s expectation that Mr. Trump, a person with an enormous history of corruption, would thank Musk for his election participation by rewarding him and his companies. Nobody quite knew how that might happen, but everyone expected that it would. I claimed, at the time, that this was unlikely to turn out the way the market thought it would, because the republicans would likely continue to favor fossil fuels, and that regulatory blockages were not the thing holding Tesla back from its automation goals. Musk did attempt to use the government in corrupt ways, as detailed this week in a report by Senator Warren, and as we all remember from the White House Auto Mall infomercial (remember, folks, “everything’s computer!“). But none of that was ever going to justify the addition of hundreds of billions of dollars to Tesla’s market cap. The market seems to be realizing that more today, as over $100 billion has been shaved off of Tesla’s market cap since the start of the feud. That’s quite a lot of priced-in expected benefit that has been wiped away, all by a single tweetstorm. While it’s all well and good to see the worst two people you know fighting each other, and to finally see the inevitable fallout between two narcissists who frankly held out much longer than any reasonable person thought they would, this fight does show the significant vulnerability that Tesla has to the whims of a CEO who has shown poor ability to control his impulses in the past. The last year or more has been highlighted by several poor business decisions by Musk, not the least of which is his support of one of the larger anti-EV entities on the planet right now. But beyond the politics, his leadership has still been erratic for the company. Not only has he paid more attention to the many other companies he runs, when he has turned his attention to Tesla, it hasn’t been positive for the company. After mostly ignoring Tesla for a few years, he went through a flurry of activity in the run-up to last year’s shareholder advisory vote on his compensation package. This flurry involved firing everyone including important leadership and successful teams, canceling an all-important affordable car project (and lying about it) and holding Tesla’s AI projects hostage while shifting both resources and staff from Tesla to his private AI company, even as he claims that AI is the future of Tesla. My favorite feature of having a Hyundai IONIQ 6 as my daily EV driver is that nobody asks me about the Epstein files in the context of the ownership experience. Now, TSLA investors have another thing to worry about – whether Musk will continue to try to “poke the bear” and get more government opposition to his company, even as he continues to make himself distasteful globally (by, for example, showing support for German neo-Nazis, agreeing with a defense of Hitler’s actions in the Holocaust, or his many other white supremacist statements). These actions have driven protests against the company, embarrassed owners and pushed many customers away – and those protesters aren’t planning on stopping. While some may cheer this new rift that has formed between Musk and one of the environment’s greatest enemies, Donald Trump, it seems unlikely that Musk’s erratic behavior will be beneficial for Tesla the company in the long run.

    "content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who said he would stay on the sidelines during this election, will spend $45 million per month to elect Donald Trump, a presidential candidate who has repeatedly targeted EVs during his campaign and who has promised to end EV incentives in exchange for a billion dollars in bribes from the oil industry. Just weeks after winning a shareholder advisory vote to reinstate his stock grant, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has apparently figured out another great way to waste money. According to the WSJ, Musk is committing $45 million per month to a newly-formed Super PAC intended to increase republican voter turnout in swing states, with the goal of electing former reality TV host, convicted felon and three-time republican nominee Donald Trump to the presidency. The Super PAC is supported by several tech-connected millionaires and billionaires, including executives from Peter Thiel’s company Palantir Technologies (named after an evil artifact in Lord of the Rings), crypto-bros Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and former Tesla director Antonio Gracias (who once tried to take Musk’s phone away), Musk’s move comes as he has shown little interest in electric cars lately, spending much more attention on various culture war causes that he has picked up on while scrolling through Twitter – the company he bought for $44 billion which has since lost 72% of its value. Since his acquisition of Twitter, Musk spent little attention managing Tesla, instead spending most of his time on social media. But to purchase Twitter, Musk sold several tranches of Tesla stock, reducing his ownership percentage in the company and depressing Tesla’s stock price. This led to a desperate campaign to have Tesla shareholders vote to advise to reinstate his previously-voided illegal pay package. In the runup to the vote, Musk spent more time with a flurry of activity at Tesla, engaging in puzzling and self-destructive actions like firing the most successful team in the company and canceling an upcoming mass market EV, all while threatening to do (what he perceives as) harm to his company if he doesn’t get his way. In the end, most of shareholders who hadn’t been turned off by Musk’s arbitrary management style were convinced, and voted to advise that his package be reinstated. Now he’s using a chunk of that newfound (potential) wealth and investing it into something quite puzzling, for a man whose wealth was built by electric cars: trying to defeat electric cars. Trump has repeatedly signaled his intent to harm the electric vehicle market during the campaign and prior. Not only has he made EVs a target several times in his campaign, primarily through ridiculous rants that show little understanding about how anything works, but he has also signaled his intent to reverse the Inflation Reduction Act, a bill signed by President Biden which has been phenomenally effective at bringing manufacturing jobs to the US and has helped to lower the price of EVs for consumers. In addition, Project 2025, a conservative playbook for the election, includes several action items which would harm EV policy and result in dirtier air and water and more climate change. The Heritage Foundation, the organization that has worked to advance Project 2025, boasts that Trump attempted to institute most of their policy recommendations in his last tour of the White House, so it can be expected that many of the Project’s ideas would make their way onto the president’s desk should America make the mistake of electing him. And it stands to reason that a potential Trump administration might try to implement these action items, because many of them were already attempted in the past. The last time he found himself in the White House, his EPA attempted to undertake a number of illegal actions to increase pollution – many of which, thankfully, were stopped by the courts (the Natural Resources Defense Council won 92% of its cases against Trump’s anti-environment actions, for example). The promise of courts being sensible and following the law is less certain this time around though, given the US “Supreme” Court’s recent history of just making it up as they go along. One of Trump’s anti-EV actions which we covered extensively on Electrek was over California’s EPA waiver, a provision of the Clean Air Act which Trump’s EPA tried to repeal. California eventually won that fight, allowing it to remain the United States’ testbed for advanced vehicle technologies and clean air regulation, leading to boons in clean air nation- and indeed world-wide. Every reasonable person I know who follow Elon Musk's journey closely had a 'one too many lies' moment that made them think differently about him. I think July 15 might be one of those moments for more people, especially considering the political line he has been walking.Elon… pic.twitter.com/bufPQVz8yo Even today – the same day that Musk has reportedly committed 8 figures per month to the campaign – we heard more news about the Trump ticket’s hostility to EVs. Trump’s VP pick is J.D. Vance, who took $352,037 in donations from the oil and gas industry in his run for Congress, becoming one of Congress’ top recipients of fossil fuel money. Prior to those donations he acknowledged climate science, but after taking hundreds of thousands in bribes, he now spreads the fossil fuel industry’s anti-science propaganda. Vance is also supported by billionaire Peter Thiel. Vance is another faux-populist who, among other things, has introduced legislation to make EVs more expensive and give a massive government subsidy to polluting gas cars, aiming for a swing of $15k in subsidies per vehicle compared to current prices. This would be on top of the tens of thousands in implicit subsidy already afforded to gas vehicles over their lifetime due to the ignored costs of pollution (which Musk himself favors a correction for in the form of a carbon tax, but it’s not too popular with his fellow far-right loons). And finally, there’s the note that car dealerships are, by and large, major republican donors. And one of the main thorns in the side of Musk and Tesla from the beginning has been the dealership lobby, which time and time again has tried to stop Tesla from selling cars or stop EV adoption, tending to find more success in republican states. In contrast, President Biden’s policy has supported EVs and Tesla significantly. Not only does the Inflation Reduction Act reduce prices of all sorts of green solutions for American consumers and businesses, it has also led to a renaissance in American manufacturing with hundreds of billions invested and hundreds of thousands of jobs created. The Inflation Reduction Act is also limited to vehicles assembled in North America, which most of Tesla’s vehicles are, and which use a lot of US-sourced parts, which Tesla tops the list of. While you can bypass most of the IRA’s restrictions by leasing, this law has still disproportionately benefitted Tesla given its American roots, enabling the Model 3 to become a fantastic deal right now (and it’s a great deal when leasing too). Musk’s donations aren’t just directed towards the opponent of the President who campaigned for and signed this law, but they go to a republican ticket that have both independently stated their intent to repeal this law that benefits Tesla. Moving on to Biden’s infrastructure plan – something which Trump was never able to pass – this includes a provision called NEVI, which grants billions to EV charging companies. Notably, the biggest EV charging company in America happens to be run by Elon Musk. That company is named Tesla. But originally, Tesla wasn’t going to qualify for NEVI funds due to its proprietary system – NEVI requires that chargers be usable by anyone, not just a single make of car. This catalyzed Tesla to create the NACS charging standard in the hope of attaining some of those federal dollars. Then, due to the actions of Rebecca Tinucci and her Supercharger team, Tesla was able to shift the entire industry over to Tesla’s NACS plug. Musk later unceremoniously fired Tinucci and the entire Supercharger team despite their success. As a result, Tesla could now qualify for billions in federal dollars to help them expand their Supercharger network, and Tesla can sell energy, at a profit, to vehicles of other makes. This could lead to potential profits of untold billions if Tesla is able to keep its massive lead in fast charging. And none of this would have happened without Biden’s NEVI. In the early days of Tesla, the company was relatively mature in terms of its participation in politics. Neither the company nor its executive made many political statements, wanting to encourage EV adoption for the good of everyone. Tesla’s core mission, which is right up there on it’s website, is to “accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.” Previously, it was stated similarly, as “to speed the world’s transition to sustainable transportation.” Both of these missions are opposed by the republican party platform Musk is donating to. It’s clear that EVs benefit air quality and the world in many ways, and Musk claimed many times that the reason he got into EVs is because he saw sustainable transport as key to survival of the human race. On this point, he was correct – transportation is the largest sector of emissions in rich countries, and the vast majority of polluting and unsustainable oil is used in vehicles with internal combustion engines. Over time Musk cultivated an independent persona around himself, suggesting that he didn’t like to get involved in politics. One example of Musk’s desire to portray his independence was when Trump tried to pull out of the Paris Agreement against public support for staying in. Trump justified the move with a number of falsehoods that showed his lack of understanding of even the most basic aspects of international relations, science, and finance. Prior to that move, Musk had been on Trump’s “advisory council”, but he immediately dropped out after the Paris announcement, rightly recognizing that “Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world”. Even this year, Musk wanted to be “super clear” that he would not donate money to either candidate for President, in a tweet that is still up on his twitter page. Just to be super clear, I am not donating money to either candidate for US President He is a genius. We just can't see how sensible it is to move his company to a state that did not allow him to sell his cars and now donate to a candidate that hopes to keep EVs from being sold. Tesla Investors has made their own grave and now they get to live in it. One could suggest that this massive donation is an attempt to get himself at the table, so that he can have some influence to reduce the anti-environment tendencies of this prospective administration. But if that were the case, it would be more likely that he would donate to both candidates, who are currently 50/50 in the polls, so that he can have influence in either administration. Indeed, given his behavior and advocacy lately, it actually seems that his far-right twitter feed has taken him over, and swept him away from any sense of rationality, self-preservation, or responsible corporate leadership, with his commitment of massive amounts of money to harm EVs – and Tesla’s core business, for the shareholders who granted him this money – and to ensure the world has a more difficult time becoming more sustainable. Update: In the end, Musk sent a total of $288 million in bribes during the 2024 election. If *you* want to help make the world a more sustainable place, consider going solar.

    "content": "The legend of the ‘Tesla killer’ is not a myth anymore. It came true, and it’s not an electric vehicle from a legacy automaker or a new EV startup; it’s Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO. In the early days of Tesla, the media loved to use the term ‘Tesla killer’ every time a legacy automaker launched a new EV. At the time, we scolded them for using it, as they would apply it to electric vehicles that didn’t match Tesla’s performance, production volumes, or profitability. Sure enough, none of them came even close to negatively affecting Tesla, let alone “killing” the company. But things are changing now. Tesla is not growing at an insane pace like it was for a decade. In fact, it’s not growing at all anymore. Tesla’s global sales declined annually for the first time in 2024, and it is starting even worse in 2025. It is undisputable that the increased EV competition is having an impact, but there isn’t a single EV model that can be deemed a “Tesla killer”—even though we do see a couple of Chinese EVs as having quite an impact on Tesla. Most Tesla fans, myself included, thought that while Tesla’s market shares would go down amid more EV competition, its sales would continue to grow as EV adoption takes over the industry. That’s exactly what happened for a few years, but the trend reversed in 2024, and it’s not because of EV adoption. Global EV sales surged by 25% in 2024, while the sales of the biggest EV automaker, Tesla, declined by 1%. There are many reasons to explain this situation, but there’s one main culprit: Elon Musk. Musk has been completely delusional about Tesla achieving self-driving capability for years, which led him to neglect the rest of Tesla’s automotive business as he thought that by the end of every year for the last 6 years, Tesla would be able to flip a switch and make all its vehicles self-driving – automatically increasing their value and making them infinitely more competitive than other vehicles. How did Musk neglect Tesla’s automotive business? The clearest example is the fact that Tesla launched a single new vehicle in the last 5 years: the Cybertruck, which proved to be a total flop. The Cybertruck launched in 2023 at a much higher price and significantly shorter range than what was promised when unveiled in 2019. With a reservation backlog at over 1 million units, Musk said that he could see Tesla eventually selling 500,000 units a year and Tesla planned for an initial production capacity of 250,000 units a year. Now, a year and a half into production, Tesla is having issues selling the Cybertruck at 10% of its planned production capacity installed at Gigafactory Texas. Musk also canceled Tesla’s plan to build a “~$25,000 electric car”, which would have greatly fueled demand and allowed Tesla to grow its delivery volumes. The CEO didn’t believe that the vehicle program would make sense if Tesla solved autonomy. He said in October 2024: “I think having a regular $25,000 model is pointless. It would be silly. It would be completely at odds with what we believe.” What Musk, and by extension Tesla, believes is that the automaker is on the verge of solving self-driving, but he has thought that to be the case every year for the last 6 years. There’s no evidence that it is now on the verge of happening, or at least, not on the hardware that Tesla has delivered so far. It’s clear that this crucial mistake about the timeline of self-driving has led Musk to make many mistakes about how to manage Tesla in the last few years. For example, Tesla’s decision to remove turn signals and gear shift stalks from vehicles started with Model S and Model X in 2021. The CEO saw them as superfluous in a self-driving world, which he thought was imminent. Now, Model S and Model X sales have crashed. Tesla brought the same design to the Model 3 with the refresh last year. Seeing the mistake years later, Tesla decided to keep the turn signal stalk with the Model Y refresh this year, and the stalk is rumored to make a comeback on the Model 3. Perhaps the biggest mistake Musk has made about self-driving is promising that “all Tesla vehicles built since 2016 have the hardware capable of self-driving” to a level that would enable a robotaxi service, which in SAE self-driving terms would mean level 4-5. Musk himself has already admitted that Tesla has been wrong about that twice: the automaker had to upgrade Tesla owners having the “2.5 Autopilot computer” to the “3.0 self-driving computer”, which Musk recently admitted will also not be able to get Tesla to self-driving capabilities. He said that Tesla would “painfully” replace the computers in all vehicles of owners who purchased the “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) software package. However, we noted that Tesla is likely in more trouble than that since it promised that “all Tesla vehicles built since 2016 have the hardware capable of self-driving” – not just those whose owners bought the FDS package. Considering this greatly affects the resale value of those vehicles, you can make the argument that there are millions of Tesla owners out there who are owed a retrofit or compensation for Tesla’s mistake. This is a current liability at Tesla worth billions of dollars, and there are already examples of lawsuits about this issue. These are all management mistakes that ultimately fall on Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO. Then, there are plenty of mistakes that Musk has made outside of Tesla that is affecting the company. The hard turn to the right, buying Twitter, boosting misinformation and Russian propaganda on the platform, financially backing Donald Trump, joining the administration and slashing critical government program indiscriminately. Regardless of if you agree or not with Musk’s politics, these are things that you simply shouldn’t do as the face of a major consumer product company as you will undoubtedly anger a large part of your consumer base. That’s exactly what’s happening. There are now weekly demonstrations at Tesla stores around the world, and sales are crashing in many markets, especially in those where Musk got politically involved, like Germany, where Tesla sales are down 70% so far this year. Musk is virtually erasing two decades of hard work to build Tesla’s brand into the world’s leading when it comes to electrification and renewable energy. Now, for a large part of the population, Tesla is just seen as the piggybank of an out-of-touch oligarch. Tesla is not dead yet, but if Musk continues to be the face of the company, it looks like it’s certainly going in that direction as this brand issue and declining demand is not going away. Some of his fans cling to the idea that the automaker is about to solve self-driving, but this belief is largely based on Musk’s claims, which have been consistently wrong. Now, it’s not to say that Tesla hasn’t made great progress on that front, but if we are to listen to the company’s own goal to be safer than humans, it means achieving “miles between critical disengagement” equivalent to human miles between collisions, which is 700,000 miles, according to NHTSA. The latest available crowdsource data, a dataset that Musk has positively referred to twice lately, shows that Tesla is currently at about 500 miles between critical disengagement. While Tesla might not die under Musk, I sincerely think that, at best, it will be a fraction of what it was at its peak, which means no bigger than it is now or in 2023. Musk’s brand is toxic and doesn’t look to be improving significantly now that he has attached himself to identity politics, culture wars, and Trump. Looking at Tesla fans and shareholders who still support him, their main hope appears to be self-driving and robots. On the self-driving front, I think it’s delusional to believe that Tesla will solve self-driving on its current hardware. I think it has made some great progress, which may result in Tesla achieving valuable levels of self-driving on next-generation hardware in the next few years. However, others are on the same path, and you have to balance Tesla’s effort against the giant liability it created for itself by promising it on millions of other vehicles. As for the robots, I’m actually somewhat bullish on humanoid robots, and I do believe that Tesla has some competitive advantage on that front. However, it’s foolish to think they will simply leapfrog the competition, which is significant in the sector. The concept that building a $25,000 car doesn't make sense if you can \"solve autonomy\" is bizarre. Even if the TAAS pipedream turns out to come true (not particularly likely), there would still be a potentially vast market for the vehicle in the meantime over a period exceeding 15 years. Notably, the Toyota Corolla was the No. 2 vehicle in the world in 2024 and it starts at $22,000 in the US. Tesla’s core business remains selling cars and batteries. There’s no doubt that the business of selling cars is not going well for Tesla right now, and under Musk, there’s no clear path to improvement. The energy business is booming, but margins are falling, and competition is increasing—especially from companies like CATL and BYD, which supply the cells that Tesla uses for its stationary batteries. On the car side, Tesla is indeed planning to launch cheaper cars this year, but that plan was a pivot after Musk canceled the “$25,000 Tesla.” These new vehicles are expected to be built on the same platform as Model 3 and Model Y, so they will be closer to these models and cannibalize them. I’d be surprised if they are enough to avoid Telsa from having its annual deliveries decline again this year. I have been saying this for a while, but it’s time for Elon to go.

    "content": "In the past week, TSLA stock has increased by about one-third of its previous value. But this increase has had nothing to do with company performance, or even due to external factors like consumer tastes or beneficial changes in EV policy. Rather, the week’s speculation has come out of a simple desire to see Tesla become the benefit of government corruption. Government corruption is a problem in much of the world. Where there is power, there will be some who seek to abuse it. To be clear, while the word corruption gets tossed around a lot, it does still mean something. It happens when a person in some position of authority uses that authority to channel wealth not towards the general public good, but to either themselves or to friends of theirs. Advanced democracies like those in Europe and the US portray themselves as being beyond corruption, and in many ways the most obvious, base levels of corruption – like direct bribery of officers of the law – are not a common a occurrence in the cultures of these advanced democracies. But this does not mean there is no corruption in these societies, it’s just revealed in different ways, or hidden behind certain levels of gentility and tradition. Nations that score high on absence of corruption indices may have rid themselves of certain forms of direct bribery, but when Toyota speaks, Japan listens; or when new US exhaust rules are up for debate and polluters like Big Oil and Auto ask for more pollution, those exhaust rules get softened despite opposition from doctors, nurses, scientists, public interest groups, many businesses, and the general public. And then, of course, there are the various court-blessed forms of bribery and election tampering which, well, we’re going to see a couple examples of in a few moments. Though perhaps those customs of gentility are showing some cracks these days, as the US stock market has openly been rewarding Tesla’s stock price all week (until today, its first down day in a week), not due to any changes in company performance or even any beneficial changes in policy (in fact, prospective policy changes are likely damaging to Tesla’s mission and product categories, not helpful), but rather due to the stock market’s seemingly open desire to see Tesla benefit from direct government corruption. The market does have reason to think this, too. Convicted felon Donald Trump, the next man who will squat in the White House after finally winning more votes than his opponent on his third try (and after committing treason in 2021, for which there is a clear legal remedy), has displayed open corruption at many points in the past. This legacy of corruption is well-chronicled and easily seen by anyone who has paid any attention. That said, the scope of it, with over 3,700 conflicts of interest displayed during his first stint as pretender to the throne, might still surprise even those who have closely followed the ridiculousness of the man’s existence. Nevertheless, the CEO of the nation’s largest EV maker has attempted to pair up with the felon in question, pledging hundreds of millions of dollars he got from selling EVs to fund a candidate who promised to tank EVs if oil companies gave him a billion-dollar bribe. Musk, despite previously correctly acknowledging that “Climate change is real. Leaving [the Paris Agreement] is not good for America or the world,” has forgotten anything he might have known about climate change, and has buddied up to someone whose last occupation of the White House, and whose party’s recent actions, have been marked by several moves aimed towards poisoning Americans with more air and water pollution and saddling everyone with higher health and fuel costs. In addition Mr. Trump has shown total ignorance (well there’s a phrase you surely haven’t heard in the last microsecond) of everything related to EVs and EV-related policy, and his running-mate even wrote a bill to increase EV prices by $15,000 compared to polluting gas vehicles. Further, those in his orbit have indicated they want other changes that likely conflict with Tesla’s business model – for example, the first car dealer elected to the Senate wants to change car dealership rules, probably not in the benefit of Tesla, which has aligned itself directly against the car dealership model. This, at first glance, seems incongruous (also at the second glance. and several more after.) It’s strange that the stock market would react to a vote of confidence in a confidence-man who clearly intends to be bad for EVs… by rewarding a company whose stated mission is to accelerate the adoption of EVs. But wait! There is perhaps an explanation for this, and if you’ve been paying any amount of attention to the words above, I bet you know what it is. Indeed, the stock market has decided that the recent situationship between these two individuals – who both have such a void in their hearts that they’ve wasted billions of dollars of their (and other people’s) money on social media companies in order to feel loved – is somehow real and is going to flourish into a beautiful, corruption-laden baby in the form of Tesla somehow being uniquely advantaged by a close relationship with the federal government. What we’re talking about here is a public consensus that Tesla, the company whose market cap has spiked more than any other over the course of the past week, is going to uniquely benefit from corruption. That it will gain due to the personal relationship described above. That’s why TSLA went up so much in the past week. It’s not because the Cybercab is driving on well-mapped private roads like we already knew it can. It’s not because they’re having trouble selling Cybertrucks. It’s not because Tesla’s Mexican factory plans have been thrown into question. And it’s not because they’ll get 50 cents or whatever every time a Volvo charges at a Supercharger. It’s because TSLA buyers, in a country that has publicly prided itself on being a bastion of economic freedom, and from a party and campaign that has claimed for so long to support these ideals, think Mr. Trump and the republicans will do some good ol’ big-government corruption and they want to benefit from it. Some analysts have attempted to come up with any number of other urbane explanations to hide their cheerleading for this corruption, but Occam’s razor leads us to the obvious answer as to what’s happening here. We don’t actually know what sort of corruption could occur here to benefit Tesla, or what the market is anticipating. As mentioned above, the likely policy changes would all be bad for EVs and solar/energy, which are the two businesses Tesla makes its money in. Already today, a new EPA pick has been announced who has already signaled an intent to destroy the environmental and economic progress made under the current EPA. He has repeatedly attacked clean air over his legislative history. Some have theorized that a new government would end various legal actions against Tesla, and that this would benefit the company. However, the most significant legal actions against Tesla are not on the federal level, and are state-level actions or class actions, not ones led by the government. The federal government is currently undergoing no significant legal actions against Tesla, except typical safety-related NHTSA investigations which every automaker sees, and aren’t likely to result in sweeping changes for Tesla. And even if the White House did try to illegally intervene in non-federal actions (and, when you vote for a criminal, you can indeed expect him to do crime) – like the case over Musk’s illegal pay package – this specific one would help Tesla by saving the company from wasting $55 billion on a bad CEO. Even proposed tariff changes (especially when implemented by an ignoramus who clearly does not understand how they work, or more accurately, don’t work) are unlikely to benefit Tesla. There are already US tariffs on Chinese EVs, and domestic manufacturing provisions which we will cover below. Tesla has actually been negatively affected by these tariffs, as its cheapest Model 3 uses a Chinese-sourced battery. Musk has previously correctly noted that tariffs on Chinese EVs are likely unhelpful, though his position does seem to change day-by-day – which is surely the sign of someone with a good grasp on the issues. Some automakers oppose tariffs because of the fear of retaliatory counter-tariffs, as we recently saw from Germany. Even TSLA cheerleader Adam Jonas noted the “difficulty” in understanding how this potential closeness would benefit Tesla, in a note sent out yesterday. So, again, it is not clear what sort of corruption TSLA gamblers think the company would benefit from. But the message from the stock market is clear: that’s what it wants. All of this comes against a backdrop of the last 4 years of government policy that has benefitted Tesla greatly. Tesla originally started business in a heavily Democratic state, with support from that state’s regulations aimed towards putting zero emission vehicles on the road. The company applied for and earned early loans from President Obama’s Democratic federal government which helped it get started, and benefitted from Obama’s EPA finally harmonizing regulations with California, a smoother regulatory environment which Mr. Trump later torpedoed. It also received more benefit from the first round of federal tax credits than any other company. And the Biden-Harris administration has again greatly benefitted Tesla, by improving the federal tax credit which Tesla has again used more than any other automaker. It also benefits from the domestic sourcing provisions in this bill, as a US automaker. In addition, the EPA has made a number of positive actions in the last four years, which Tesla has lobbied for, and which Tesla will benefit from (in contrast to Mr. Trump’s actions, which Tesla lobbied against, and which harmed Tesla). Even the NACS transition was sparked by the Biden administration’s actions, because federal rules requiring intercompatibility as a qualification for receiving charging grants is what led Tesla to introduce the standard to begin with. The company will likely benefit from this, though recent chaos caused by the mercurial actions of its bad CEO have put a damper on that. Unlike investors’ apparent desires from the incoming regime, these actions were not corruptly targeted towards an individual company on the basis of personal gain or perceived friendship, but towards the public good. Tesla just happened to be the biggest company building a product that helps make transportation cleaner, and thus benefitted the most. So again, the whiplash here of a positive stock response to negative news is confusing, unless we explain it as corruption. Now, there are still reasons to think that this might not turn out as well as this week’s gamblers might think. After all, both individuals are known for their capriciousness, for turnover increasing the closer you get to them in their respective organizations, for those they’ve worked closely with speaking out against them, and for their habit of firing high-performers who deign to present ideas – no matter how reasonable – if those ideas happen to be in opposition to whatever each respective egomaniac’s current fixation is. Always a sign of a great leader if their closest team members keep quitting – and surely two “leaders” of that sort are even more likely to work well together… right? Tesla stock is a meme stock (mostly). DJT stock is completely a meme stock (almost no profit for a several billion dollar valuation). When are people going to learn that the corporations and individual billionaires are the ones winning and not the people? Mass deportation is coming in the US and groceries will get more expensive. So will menial labor. Tariffs are coming, and so the prices of goods are going to go up as well. This is not the solution for the American people who are hurting financially. It is the solution for the rich who can afford to invest extra money and ride the corporate success wagon. But whether it works out or not, let us call all of this exactly what it is: the stock market is actively, openly, betting on corruption (and not just with Tesla – this week, crypto markets have been going crazy, expecting that a scammer in the White House will benefit an asset class that exists solely to facilitate scams). It hopes for a handout, hopes for exemptions and carveouts, and hopes for “government to pick the winners and losers” (remember when the republican candidate made that statement, about Tesla specifically?). This is not a group of people that support properly working markets, competition, or any of the ideals they often profess. They certainly aren’t looking forward to better policy for the public good. They are instead expecting and advocating for corruption. It’s the kind of thing that’s more appropriate for a Banana Republic(an), not one of those aforementioned advanced democracies which we used to be able to consider ourselves one of.

    "content": "Electric car company Tesla Motors has filed for a $100 million IPO. There were rumors recently floating around that the company, which is led by PayPal co-founder Elon Musk, would go public “soon.” One interesting tidbit from the filing: Musk only takes $1 in yearly salary. Another interesting factoid: In the filing, Tesla states that it has seen net losses in each quarter since inception. The company expects to continue on the same path until it starts to deliver larger quantities of its Model S sedan, which is not expected until 2010 or later. Tesla took a loss in the first three quarters of 2009 of $31.5 million which is less than its loss for the same period in 2008, which was $57.3 million. Gross profit for the first three quarters of 2009 was $7.8 million compared to $561K for the same period in 2008. Sales for the first three quarters of 2009 topped out at $93.4 million. As of last December Tesla had sold 937 Tesla Roadsters in 18 countries. The company also saw a total of $108.2 million in revenue since its inception in 2003 until September of last year. Tesla claimed profitability in August of last year, reporting at the time that it made “approximately $1 million of earnings” on revenues of $20 million, and that it shipped 109 Roadsters, its $109,000 all-electric sports car. Although the company took a loss for the first three quarters of 2009, we are assuming that Tesla may have posted a profit in the fourth quarter, which is why the company claimed profitability last year. In June, Tesla was also awarded a $465 million loan from the Department of Energy, which will help it manufacture its more reasonably priced Modern S sedan. The company went through a bit of a scandal with a scathing law suit filed against Tesla Motors and Elon Musk by co-founder and former CEO Martin Eberhard, which was eventually dropped. Last year, Daimler also took a 10% (or $50 million) stake in Tesla, putting the company’s then valuation at $500 million. Leena Rao is currently a Senior Writer at Fortune Magazine.

    "content": "ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users. 2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora. OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit. In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history. Below, you’ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here. To see a list of 2024 updates, go here. OpenAI is reportedly adding parental controls to ChatGPT on web and mobile, letting parents and teens link accounts to enable safeguards like limiting sensitive content, setting quiet hours, and disabling features such as voice mode or image generation. The move comes amid growing regulatory scrutiny and a lawsuit over the chatbot’s alleged role in a teen’s suicide. OpenAI unveiled Pulse, a new ChatGPT feature that delivers personalized morning briefings overnight, encouraging users to start their day with the app. The tool reflects a shift toward making ChatGPT more proactive and asynchronous, positioning it as a true assistant rather than just a chatbot. OpenAI’s new Applications CEO, Fidji Simo, called Pulse the first step toward bringing high-level personal support to everyone, starting with Pro users. OpenAI launched Instant Checkout in ChatGPT, letting U.S. users purchase products directly from Etsy and, soon, over a million Shopify merchants without leaving the conversation. Shoppers can browse items, read reviews, and complete purchases with a single tap using Apple Pay, Google Pay, Stripe, or a credit card. The update marks a step toward reshaping online shopping by merging product discovery, recommendations, and payments in one place. OpenAI rolled out its budget-friendly ChatGPT Go plan in Indonesia for Rp 75,000 ($4.50) per month, following its initial launch in India. The mid-tier plan, which offers higher usage limits, image generation, file uploads, and better memory compared to the free version, enters the market in direct competition with Google’s new AI Plus plan in Indonesia. CEO Sam Altman announced new policies for under-18 users of ChatGPT, tightening safeguards around sensitive conversations. The company says it will block flirtatious exchanges with minors and add stronger protections around discussions of suicide, even escalating severe cases to parents or authorities. The move comes as OpenAI faces a wrongful death lawsuit tied to alleged chatbot interactions, underscoring rising concerns about the mental health risks of AI companions. OpenAI rolled out GPT-5-Codex, a new version of its AI coding agent that can spend anywhere from a few seconds to seven hours tackling a task, depending on complexity. The company says this dynamic approach helps the model outperform GPT-5 on key coding benchmarks, including bug fixes and large-scale refactoring. The update comes as OpenAI looks to keep Codex competitive in a fast-growing market that now includes rivals like Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot. OpenAI is shaking up its Model Behavior team, the small but influential group that helps shape how its AI interacts with people. The roughly 14-person team is being folded into the larger Post Training group, now reporting to lead researcher Max Schwarzer. Meanwhile, founding leader Joanne Jang is spinning up a new unit called OAI Labs, focused on prototyping fresh ways for people to collaborate with AI. OpenAI, facing a lawsuit from the parents of a 16-year-old who died by suicide, said in its blog that it has implemented new safeguards for ChatGPT, including stronger detection of mental health risks and parental control features. The AI company said the updates aim to provide tighter protections around suicide-related conversations and give parents more oversight of their children’s use. Elon Musk’s AI startup, xAI, filed a federal lawsuit in Texas against Apple and OpenAI, alleging that the two companies colluded to lock up key markets and shut out rivals. OpenAI introduced its most affordable subscription plan, ChatGPT Go, in India, priced at 399 rupees per month (approximately $4.57). This move aims to expand OpenAI’s presence in its second-largest market, offering enhanced access to the latest GPT-5 model and additional features. Since its May 2023 launch, ChatGPT’s mobile app has amassed $2 billion in global consumer spending, dwarfing competitors like Claude, Copilot, and Grok by roughly 30 times, according to Appfigures. This year alone, the app has generated $1.35 billion, a 673% increase from the same period in 2024, averaging nearly $193 million per month, or 53 times more than its nearest rival, Grok. Despite unveiling GPT-5 as a “one-size-fits-all” AI, OpenAI is still offering several legacy AI options, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3. Users can choose between new “Auto,” “Fast,” and “Thinking” modes for GPT-5, and paid subscribers regain access to legacy models like GPT-4o and GPT-4.1. Updates to ChatGPT:You can now choose between “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” for GPT-5. Most users will want Auto, but the additional control will be useful for some people.Rate limits are now 3,000 messages/week with GPT-5 Thinking, and then extra capacity on GPT-5 Thinking… OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Reddit users that GPT-5’s “dumber” behavior at launch was due to a router issue and promised fixes, double rate limits for Plus users, and transparency on which model is answering, while also shrugging off the infamous “chart crime” from the live presentation. OpenAI released GPT-5, a next-gen AI that’s not just smarter but more useful — able to handle tasks like coding apps, managing calendars, and creating research briefs — while automatically figuring out the fastest or most thoughtful way to answer your questions. OpenAI is making a major push into federal government workflows, offering ChatGPT Enterprise to agencies for just $1 for the next year. The move comes after the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) added OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to its approved AI vendor list, allowing agencies to access these tools through preset contracts without negotiating pricing. OpenAI unveiled its first open source language models since GPT-2, introducing two new open-weight AI releases: gpt-oss-120b, a high-performance model capable of running on a single Nvidia GPU, and gpt-oss-20b, a lighter model optimized for laptop use. The move comes amid growing competition in the global AI market and a push for more open technology in the U.S. and abroad. ChatGPT’s rapid growth is accelerating. OpenAI said the chatbot was on track to hit 700 million weekly active users in the first week of August, up from 500 million at the end of March. Nick Turley, OpenAI’s VP and head of the ChatGPT app, highlighted the app’s growth on X, noting it has quadrupled in size over the past year. This week, ChatGPT is on track to reach 700M weekly active users — up from 500M at the end of March and 4× since last year. Every day, people and teams are learning, creating, and solving harder problems. Big week ahead. Grateful to the team for making ChatGPT more useful and… OpenAI unveiled Study Mode, a new ChatGPT feature designed to promote critical thinking by prompting students to engage with material rather than simply receive answers. The tool is now rolling out to Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users, with availability for Edu subscribers expected in the coming weeks. ChatGPT users should be cautious when seeking emotional support from AI, as the AI industry lacks safeguards for sensitive conversations, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on a recent episode of This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von. Unlike human therapists, AI tools aren’t bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, he noted. ChatGPT now receives 2.5 billion prompts daily from users worldwide, including roughly 330 million from the U.S. That’s more than double the volume reported by CEO Sam Altman just eight months ago, highlighting the chatbot’s explosive growth. OpenAI has introduced ChatGPT Agent, which completes a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users and combines several capabilities like Operator and Deep Research, according to the company. OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user’s calendar, draft editable presentations and slideshows, run code, shop online, and handle complex workflows from end to end, all within a secure virtual environment. Researchers at Stanford University have observed that therapy chatbots powered by large language models can sometimes stigmatize people with mental health conditions or respond in ways that are inappropriate or could be harmful. While chatbots are “being used as companions, confidants, and therapists,” the study found “significant risks.” CEO Sam Altman said that the company is delaying the release of its open model, which had already been postponed by a month earlier this summer. The ChatGPT maker, which initially planned to release the model around mid-July, has indefinitely postponed its launch to conduct additional safety testing. we planned to launch our open-weight model next week.we are delaying it; we need time to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas. we are not yet sure how long it will take us.while we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are… OpenAI plans to release an AI-powered web browser to challenge Alphabet’s Google Chrome. It will keep some user interactions within ChatGPT, rather than directing people to external websites. Some ChatGPT users have noticed a new feature called “Study Together” appearing in their list of available tools. This is the chatbot’s approach to becoming a more effective educational tool, rather than simply providing answers to prompts. Some people also wonder whether there will be a feature that allows multiple users to join the chat, similar to a study group. Referrals from ChatGPT to news publishers are increasing. But this rise is insufficient to offset the decline in clicks as more users now obtain their news directly from AI or AI-powered search results, according to a report by digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Since Google launched its AI Overviews in May 2024, the percentage of news searches that don’t lead to clicks on news websites has increased from 56% to nearly 69% by May 2025. OpenAI has started using Google’s AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using non-Nvidia chips in an important way. Researchers from MIT’s Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools. The ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to ZDNET report citing Similarweb’s X post. Sam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider. In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate. OpenAI has unveiled o3-pro, an enhanced version of its o3, a reasoning model that the chatGPT maker launched earlier this year. O3-pro is available for ChatGPT and Team users and in the API, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access in the third week of June. OpenAI o3-pro is available in the model picker for Pro and Team users starting today, replacing OpenAI o1-pro.Enterprise and Edu users will get access the week after.As o3-pro uses the same underlying model as o3, full safety details can be found in the o3 system card.… OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT’s conversational voice mood for all paid users across different markets and platforms. The startup has launched an update to Advanced Voice that enables users to converse with ChatGPT out loud in a more natural and fluid sound. The feature also helps users translate languages more easily, the comapny said. OpenAI’s ChatGPT now offers new funtions for business users, including integrations with various cloud services, meeting recordings, and MCP connection support for connecting to tools for in-depth research. The feature enables ChatGPT to retrieve information across users’ own services to answer their questions. For instance, an analyst could use the company’s slide deck and documents to develop an investment thesis. OpenAI plans to purchase Jony Ive’s devices startup io for $6.4 billion. Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, thinks that the hardware will significantly enhance ChatGPT and broaden OpenAI’s reach to a larger audience in the future. OpenAI has introduced its AI coding agent, Codex, powered by codex-1, a version of its o3 AI reasoning model designed for software engineering tasks. OpenAI says codex-1 generates more precise and “cleaner” code than o3. The coding agent may take anywhere from one to 30 minutes to complete tasks such as writing simple features, fixing bugs, answering questions about your codebase, and running tests. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said during a recent AI event hosted by VC firm Sequoia that he wants ChatGPT to record and remember every detail of a person’s life when one attendee asked about how ChatGPT can become more personalized. OpenAI said in a post on X that it has launched its GPT-4.1 and GPT4.1 mini AI models in ChagGPT. By popular request, GPT-4.1 will be available directly in ChatGPT starting today.GPT-4.1 is a specialized model that excels at coding tasks & instruction following. Because it’s faster, it’s a great alternative to OpenAI o3 & o4-mini for everyday coding needs. OpenAI has launched a new feature for ChatGPT deep research to analyze code repositories on GitHub. The ChatGPT deep research feature is in beta and lets developers connect with GitHub to ask questions about codebases and engineering documents. The connector will soon be available for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users, with support for Enterprise and Education coming shortly, per an OpenAI spokesperson. After introducing a data residency program in Europe in February, OpenAI has now launched a similar program in Asian countries including India, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The new program will be accessible to users of ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu, and API. It will help organizations in Asia meet their local data sovereignty requirements when using OpenAI’s products. OpenAI is unveiling a program called OpenAI for Countries, which aims to develop the necessary local infrastructure to serve international AI clients better. The AI startup will work with governments to assist with increasing data center capacity and customizing OpenAI’s products to meet specific language and local needs. OpenAI for Countries is part of efforts to support the company’s expansion of its AI data center Project Stargate to new locations outside the U.S., per Bloomberg. OpenAI has announced its plan to make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an update that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users. OpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model’s personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast. An issue within OpenAI’s ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch’s testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.” OpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics. OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI’s cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch. OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch. OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company skipped that step — sending safety cards for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.” Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score. OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads. OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI’s safety report. OpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI’s previous models. Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company’s X post. All of your image creations, all in one place.Introducing the new library for your ChatGPT image creations—rolling out now to all Free, Plus, and Pro users on mobile and https://t.co/nYW5KO1aIg. pic.twitter.com/ADWuf5fPbj OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition. OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT. OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14. OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek’s upgraded V3. OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API. OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report. OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.” OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version. More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos. The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task. In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia. OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior. OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected. Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer. OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’s official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch. OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans. Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.” OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less. OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1. Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.PROMPT:Please write a metafictional literary short story… OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026. OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them. The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users. According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch. OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model. A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing. In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions. OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in. OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources. OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post. OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.” A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users. OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data. Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm. OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s. OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online. Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website. OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email. ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week. OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely. ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use. Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o. There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus. Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns. Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool. Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space. GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer. A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions. ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt. Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel. We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry. Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users. It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words. Yes, it was released March 1, 2023. Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc. Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc. It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used. Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet. Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives. OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”. The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”. In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.” Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm. An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service. CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect. Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with. There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes. Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day. Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best. No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service. None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT. Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data. This story is continually updated with new information.

Hold on to your Apple Watches, folks! At WWDC 2024, Apple finally decided to give Siri a brain transplant with something they’re calling “Apple Intelligence” (AI—get it?). Apparently, it’s so smart it’ll know more about your life than you do. Tim Cook promises it’ll be all about privacy and personal context — so intimate even your diary might feel neglected. And guess what? Siri’s makeover means we get Genmoji (yes, that’s real), because I just know you’ve been aching for an AI to craft your emojis. Also on the menu: typing queries into Siri like it’s 2010 again and a “Private Cloud Compute,” which sounds like techie speak for “We’re still spying on you but in a nicer way.” Look out for this new wave of iMagic rolling out soon! Here’s everything that was announced at WWDC! Not everyone is psyched about the announcements, though: In the newest episode of “Tech Titans Throw Tantrums” this week, Elon Musk threatens to ban iPhones from Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI over Apple’s new ChatGPT integration. I guess that in Elon’s world, “cutting-edge innovation” is synonymous with banning the world’s most popular smartphone over an AI assistant feature that asks for permission before doing anything. Is Tim Cook quaking in his boots or just rolling his eyes? Answers on a postcard, plz. In today’s episode of “The Mighty: How They Have Fallen,” we bring you the tragic tale of Byju’s, once a $22 billion edtech darling, now worth zero in BlackRock’s eyes. After missing financial targets, dealing with resignations faster than you can say “governance issues,” and getting publicly roasted by investors, Byju’s has become a cautionary tale for startups everywhere. Now hold on to your cap tables, folks! Once the darling of Silicon Valley with dreams of becoming the ultimate stock trading overlord, Carta faces a valuation nosedive from $8.5 billion to a mere $2 billion — if they’re lucky. After getting caught red-handed misusing customer data and retreating from their secondary trading venture faster than you can say “PR disaster,” it’s clear that not all that glitters in startup land is gold. With lawsuits, toxic culture claims, and clients fleeing for bigger banks, it seems Carta’s high-flying days are grounded for good. Investors like Andreessen Horowitz must be thrilled … Welcome to the 2024 startup funding circus, where Y Combinator companies are performing a daring new act — raising tiny seed rounds with sky-high valuations and no lead investors. Angels are swooping in like hungry pigeons, leaving institutional investors scratching their heads and clutching their wallets. Will this high-wire act pay off or will it leave startups dangling without a safety net? Grab your popcorn; this version of the show is just getting started! Damn, the Paris-based AI startup Mistral AI just snagged a whopping $640 million in its Series B funding. With General Catalyst leading the charge, this fresh-faced contender in the AI arena is now valued at a cool $6 billion. Co-founded by ex-Meta and DeepMind brainiacs, Mistral aims to take on big shots like OpenAI with their own shiny models and open source goodies. But don’t get too cozy; their top-tier models are locked tighter than Banque de France unless you’ve got an API pass. Welcome to the world where cats finally get the VIP treatment they deserve — Meowtel has clawed its way to profitability, despite dog-obsessed VCs turning up their noses. Founder Sonya Petcavich, inspired by her own feline guilt trip, took $100,000 and a dream to create an elite cat-sitting service. With 2,200 sitters and over 95,000 successful sits under its belt (or should we say collar?), Meowtel is proving that cats aren’t just second-class pets.

    "content": "OpenAI is gearing up to host its third annual developer conference, DevDay 2025, on Monday. The company says more than 1,500 people are scheduled to convene at Fort Mason in San Francisco for OpenAI’s “biggest event yet,” which features announcements, keynotes from OpenAI executives, and a fireside chat between CEO Sam Altman and longtime Apple designer Jony Ive. From the sound of it, DevDay 2025 is shaping up to be a grand display of OpenAI’s rising dominance in Silicon Valley against giants like Apple, Google, and Meta. OpenAI is currently building an AI device, a social media app, and an AI-powered browser to take on Chrome. In other words, OpenAI has a lot more going on than it did during its first DevDay in 2023, when it mostly just had ChatGPT and an API business for developers to access its models. At the same time, OpenAI faces more competition than ever in the bid to win over developers. In the last year, Anthropic’s and Google’s AI models have become increasingly capable for coding tasks and web design. OpenAI has been forced to release better AI models at lower prices to remain in the race. In the background, Meta has built up an impressive roster of AI talent in its new group, Meta Superintelligence Labs, which could become another threat to OpenAI in the near future. OpenAI unveiled at its first DevDay in 2023 a new AI model, GPT-4 Turbo, and Altman shared his vision for a marketplace of AI agents called the GPT Store. Altman was ousted as CEO days later — only to return after a dramatic weekend of negotiations. In 2024, OpenAI responded with a more subdued conference, announcing some meaningful developer upgrades, such as an API for AI voice applications, but not much else. Nothing is confirmed to launch at DevDay 2025, stoking plenty of rumors. Perhaps OpenAI will finally unveil the AI-powered browser it’s been working on, or maybe give an update on the AI device it’s building with Ive and former Apple executives. It’s also possible there could be some updates related to the GPT Store, or a new offering that lets developers build agentic workflows. TechCrunch will be on the ground in San Francisco covering the event live, so you can check back here for all the news. Here’s what you need to know about OpenAI’s DevDay, and how to watch it. DevDay 2025 kicks off at 10 a.m. PT October 6 with an opening keynote from Altman, in which he’s scheduled to unveil “announcements, live demos, and a vision of how developers are reshaping the future with AI.” The keynote will last roughly one hour and will be livestreamed on OpenAI’s YouTube page. That’s the only event that will be livestreamed for remote attendees. For in-person attendees, there will be onstage presentations and talks from Cursor CEO Michael Truell, San Francisco mayor Daniel Lurie, and Andreessen Horowitz investing partner Kimberly Tan, among others. Several OpenAI employees will also give speeches about their work, including model behavior researcher Laurentia Romaniuk and Codex lead Alexander Embiricos. There’s also supposed to be a series of AI-powered sideshows at DevDay 2025. One of them is “Sora Cinema,” which is described as a “cozy mini-theater with popcorn” featuring short films generated by OpenAI’s video model, Sora. There’s also supposed to be a phone booth with a “living portrait” of the famed computer scientist Alan Turing “that speaks back.” Later in the afternoon, there will be two big events to cap off DevDay. These last two events won’t be livestreamed, but they will be posted on YouTube later that day. At 3:15 p.m. PT, there will be a “Developer State of the Union” with OpenAI president Greg Brockman and Olivier Godement, who heads up product for the OpenAI Platform. The two OpenAI executives are slated to “demo new capabilities” and share what’s ahead for developers. Finally, at 4:15 p.m. PT, Altman and Ive will give a “Closing Fireside Chat” to discuss the “craft of building in the age of AI.” That conversation will last about 45 minutes. Update 10/6/25: This article was originally published on 10/3/25. It was updated to reflect changes to DevDay’s guest list, as well as new rumors that surfaced over the weekend.

Reminder that the agenda is out for TC Sessions: Mobility 2022. I think we put together a pretty sweet program. A few new announcements you might have missed includes an interview we’ll have with Sterling Anderson, co-founder and CPO of Aurora, and Rebecca Yeung, corporate VP of operations science and advanced technology at FedEx. We’ll be announcing a couple more guests in the next few days. As always, you can email me at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com to share thoughts, criticisms, opinions or tips. You also can send a direct message to me at Twitter — @kirstenkorosec. For some bizarre reason, it’s illegal for people to use privately owned e-scooters on public roads in England. Instead, e-scooters can only be legally ridden as part of government-backed rental pilots. However, England is finally getting around to legalizing private e-scooters for use on roads. Nothing is for certain yet, but Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said that legislation will be included in the Queen’s Speech on May 10. If legalized, private scooters will have to meet similar safety specifications as those in the public trials, namely max speeds of 15.5 miles per hour and automatic lights. If legalized, this will also open up a huge market to the e-scooter makers of the world, and might even spark more homegrown business. Taur, for example, is a British company that has just launched operations in Los Angeles, in large part because the U.K. was dragging its heels on this piece of legislation. It’ll also undoubtedly help English cities meet their climate goals. In the U.S., Portland has learned that emissions due to transportation are one of the main reasons the city can’t reach its emissions targets. Unfortunately, the city is considering making the problem worse by widening highways… :eyeroll-emoji: Perhaps not all hope is lost for American cities, though. They just need to get the policy to align with demand. A new study has found that e-bike sales are outpacing electric car sales in the U.S., which makes sense, given market availability of the two types of vehicles. But it’s also an encouraging finding! Many people, like parents, are also finding e-cargo bikes to be a nice replacement to the minivan as a vehicle to cart kids around. Bolt said it will invest about $158 million (€150 million) in 2022 to scale its scooter and e-bike operations to more than 230,000 scooters and e-bikes across 250+ cities. Earlier this year, the company raised a whopping $709 million, which is no doubt going to help fuel this expansion. Populus is partnering with cities and operators like Bolt, Tier and Voi in a European Union-funded, data-sharing initiative that will measure carbon reductions of micromobility. Voi is launching hundreds of e-scooters in Oslo that will be equipped with Drover AI’s computer vision, camera-based scooter ADAS tech, which will help with the ever-annoying problem of scooters on sidewalks. Cooper Bikes, which is owned by the makers of the Mini Cooper car, dropped four new e-bike models. Indian e-scooter manufacturer Dispatch says it will launch a purpose-built e-scooter (not a kick scooter, one of the moped-looking ones) in Q1 2023 that will be purpose-built to enable shared and commercial applications. Ola Electric has to recall more than 1,400 mopeds after one of them caught fire. Elon Musk’s pursuit to buy Twitter continues to have an impact on Tesla, which is why I’m back here writing about a social media platform. The latest example was revealed in a series of regulatory filings that showed he sold 9.6 million shares of Tesla, worth about $8.5 billion. Tesla shares fell more than 11% last week. Musk, who still holds about 16% of the automaker, said in a tweet on Thursday: “No further TSLA sales planned after today.” It’s unclear where the remaining funds needed in the $44 billion deal will come from. Much of Musk’s fortune is tied up in Tesla stock. A friendly reminder that if Musk backs out of the deal, he’s on the hook for $1 billion, per the termination fee of the deal with Twitter, so at least that amount would be covered by these sales. Other deals that caught my attention this week … BattGenie, a University of Washington startup that developed software to improve performance of batteries, raised $1.5 million in a seed funding round co-led by Powerhouse Ventures and VoLo Earth Ventures. The company also received a $300,000 grant from the Washington State Department of Commerce. Blink Charging has acquired U.K.-based EV charging provider EB Charging for $23.5 million, a move that might help the company expand its reach enough to keep up with some of the larger players. Crow Bicycles, a Spanish e-bike startup, has raised $325,000 that it will use to release a premium line of e-bikes this year, the company said. Dat Bike is a new Vietnamese e-motorbike startup that just raised $5.3 million in a Series A to continue designing and producing components domestically to reduce costs and improve performance. Divergent Technologies, a Los Angeles-based manufacturing startup, raised $160 million in a Series C funding round. John L. Thornton, former president of Goldman Sachs, executive chairman of Barrick Gold and board member of Ford, has joined Divergent’s board. FreeWire Technologies, the EV charging company, raised $125 million. The financing included a senior convertible note provided by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock Financial Management and a concurrent equity raise with institutional and strategic investors such as bp ventures, Riverstone Holdings, Octave Ventures, Gly Capital Management, Blue Bear Capital and Daishin Private Equity. Neuron, a Singapore-based company that has carved itself into the Australia/New Zealand market, as well as pieces of the U.K. and Canada, has just raised a $43.5 million Series B that it will use to continue pursuing limited vendor permits with cities in those markets. South 8 Technologies, a startup focused on electrolyte formulations for next-generation lithium batteries, raised $12 million in a Series A round led by Anzu Partners with participation from LG Technology Ventures, Shell Ventures, Foothill Ventures and Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation. SWTCH Energy Inc. raised $13 million in new financing to expand its EV charging products to multi-family buildings across North America. The new capital includes a $10 million Series A round led by the venture capital arm of Aligned Climate Capital and a $3 million credit facility from Silicon Valley Bank. Additional Series A investors include Landmark Management Inc., Elemental Energy, IBI Group, Active Impact Investments and Pacific Reach. Swvl, an Egyptian startup that provides shared transportation services for intercity and intracity trips, has expanded into Turkey through an acquisition of Volt Lines, a B2B transportation-as-a-service operator. The primarily stock deal was valued at around $40 million. Swvl, which earlier went public via a SPAC merger, confirmed to TechCrunch a deal to buy U.K. startup Zeelo that is estimated to be a $100 million acquisition. Baidu, the Chinese internet giant, and autonomous vehicle company Pony.ai have received permits to provide driverless ride-hailing services to the public on open roads in Beijing. Pony.ai also was awarded a permit in Guangzhou to operate 100 robotaxis as traditional taxis. Ford CEO Jim Farley hinted during the company’s first-quarter earnings call that it’s interested in expanding its partnership with autonomous vehicle technology company Argo AI to focus on middle mile deliveries. General Motors expects expenses for its autonomous driving subsidiary Cruise to be about $2 billion this year. Local Motors no longer exists with the exception of one last asset: its domain name. That is being auctioned now and as of press time the highest bid was about $8,500. The Indy Autonomous Challenge racecar, which was programmed by team PoliMOVE from Politecnico di Milano and the University of Alabama, set a new land speed world record of 192.2 miles per hour at the historic Kennedy Space Center. Michigan State University introduced the Karsan Autonomous e-ATAK bus, an electric autonomous vehicle that will run on campus. The project is through a collaboration with the Michigan Office of Mobility and Electrification, bus manufacturer Karsan and San Francisco-based AV company ADASTEC. Mobileye has begun testing its self-driving vehicles in Miami and Stuttgart. It’s unclear just how many vehicles are in either test fleet. WeRide is launching its Robosweeper, a mass-produced self-driving sweeper vehicle, in China. The company is gearing up for a large-scale road test in May with a fleet of more than 50 vehicles to be conducted in Guangzhou. Ford reported a multibillion-dollar loss in the first quarter due to an eye-popping write-off on the value of its stake in Rivian, an EV company that has seen its stock drop by nearly 70% since its IPO. Ford also revealed its supply chain strategy and expressed a positive outlook for 2022 backed by its efforts the past few years to secure battery and EV manufacturing in-house and serious demand in its EV lineup. In a separate yet related note, Amazon also reported a massive loss due to its Rivian holding. General Motors’ first-quarter earnings report and accompanying analyst call Tuesday highlighted the company’s grand ambitions for electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles — and the money it is willing to put behind them. Three items stuck out to me and reporter Jaclyn Trop: its $2 billion spending plan for Cruise, a proposal to tie the compensation packages of highest-ranking executives to EV quality and sales targets and its low-cost EV plans. Ford held a splashy event celebrating the launch of production of its new F-150 Lightning EV. During that event, CEO Jim Farley said Ford will build a second EV truck. The government of Saudi Arabia, which is connected to the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund that owns 61% of Lucid Group, agreed to buy 100,000 of the automaker’s electric vehicles over the next decade. Vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-to-home charging — also called bidirectional charging — have long been the stuff of demonstration programs. TechCrunch contributor Jim Motavalli explores whether bidirectional EV charging is ready for the home market? West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin criticized a potential expansion of the federal EV tax credit, calling it “ludicrous.” Instead, he argued that the money should be used for the development of hydrogen. Sorry y’all, this guy was in the news so much that he is getting his own section this issue. Elon Musk announced The Boring Company would attempt to build a working hyperloop, and less than a week since the company raised $675 million at a $5.7 billion valuation. A day after the hyperloop announcement, Musk tweeted that the company plans to begin “full-scale” testing of hyperloop this year. A judge rejected Musk’s attempt to terminate a 2018 settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that requires oversight of some of his Tesla-related tweets. Meanwhile, a Delaware judge sided with Musk in a $13 billion lawsuit brought by Tesla shareholders, which accused the executive of coercing the electric vehicle company’s board into buying SolarCity back in 2016. While the court found that Musk “was more involved in the process than a conflicted fiduciary should be,” it ultimately ruled in favor of the “technoking” on all counts. Shareholders still have the option to file an appeal. Nissan has tapped Luminar to help it develop a new ADAS system that it hopes will drastically reduce accidents. The automaker expects its new tech will be available on every new model by 2030. Hertz hired Ned Ryan as chief product development officer. Ryan, who most recently was at Ford, is a serial entrepreneur. He launched in 2013 a flexible rideshare financing company called Breeze that was purchased by Ford in 2016. He also founded Canvas, a vehicle subscription service that was acquired by Fair.com at the end of 2019. Passport, a transportation software and payments company, hired D. Burt Arrington as general counsel and corporate secretary. Arrington previously worked at the law firm of Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP. Morgan Motor Company hired Lamborghini executive Massimo Fumarola as CEO, replacing Steve Morris. The U.K.-based company said that Morris will become executive chairman. Nuvocargo, a logistics startup focused simplifying U.S.-Mexico cross-border trade, hired Jay Gerard as head of customs. Gerard has more than 20 years of logistics and operational management experience and was most recently Global Customs Director, North America, at Flexport. Waze hired Harris Beber as its chief marketing officer to lead all global partnerships and marketing. Harris most recently worked at Vimeo, where he scaled the company’s of 260M+ video professionals, businesses, and brands and helped take the company public in 2021. He previously served as CMO at The Nature’s Bounty Company, and held various senior marketing positions at Amazon, Shutterfly and 1-800-Flowers.com. In 2010, he sold his retail e-commerce business, Giftback. Volkswagen Group has been asked by Sen. Mark Rubio for more information regarding planned joint ventures with two Chinese companies to supply nickel, cobalt, lithium and other materials used to make batteries for electric vehicles. The companies have been accused of having a record of alleged human rights violations such as forced labor and human trafficking, Bloomberg reported.

Not literally. Or perhaps yes literally — come say hi to us on Twitter. We may not always be able to respond, but it’d be nice to know you’re out there. Tell us your favorite little-known fact, for example. Clicking on that link gets you started. — Christine and Haje Unacademy, one of India’s high-flying startups, is going through a round of cost-cutting measures, including salary reduction for founders and shutting down “certain businesses” as it tightens its belt and pledges an IPO in the next 2 years, Manish reports. Apropos layoffs, Natasha M took a closer look at the data about who has been hit the hardest in the great tech layoff wave. Spoiler alert: It’s fintech leading the discharge. There’s also a bunch of other really interesting pieces of news from the past week, in Natasha’s Startups Weekly newsletter. You can subscribe to that, and a bunch of our other awesome newsletters, on this handy one-stop-shop subscription page. It’s been a busy weekend on TechCrunch. Here’s the cream of the crop! “Fun” fact we stumbled across when Googling stuff for this newsletter: Wikipedia tells me that to “decimate” actually means “to reduce by 10%” and stems from the Roman army, where, as punishment, every tenth man in a group was executed by members of his cohort. That means two things: Getting fired from a startup sucks, but at least you’re not getting murdered. Also, Hopin, which started this rabbit hole, was not just decimated, but decimated three times over. Yowzers. Early-stage startups must revisit their pricing models regularly: The competitive landscape is in a constant state of flux, and each time they release a new product or service, their revenue streams should be recalibrated. In his latest TC+ post, Michael Perez, director of growth and data at VC firm M13, shares five questions he uses to devise pricing strategy frameworks, along with three value metrics and a detailed measurement plan for GTM strategy. “Pricing models that scale proportionally with value tend to capture more value as revenue and contribution margin,” he writes. “Contribution margin can then be reinvested in sales and marketing or operations to create more value.” Turn your startup’s pricing strategy into a powerful growth lever (TechCrunch+ is our membership program, which helps founders and startup teams get ahead.

Taylor got the news up quickly, while Darrell covered Twitter’s initial reaction and Kirsten “delivered” (pun intended) one of the best headlines in her article on Tesla shares. Meta is going after “fake news” in a new way with Sphere, an artificial intelligence tool based on content from the open web, and Wikipedia is its first user, Ingrid writes. Meanwhile, London lost its hold on Australia-based Atlassian, which said it will be moving its headquarters to Delaware, Mike reports. Please, please announce yourself to the neighbor with this gif. Sometimes robotics doesn’t always work, and unfortunately, that is the case with salad robot startup Chowbotics, which 17 months ago was bought by DoorDash and is now shutting down, Brian writes. Here’s what else we have for you today: Christine Hall wrote about enterprise/B2B, e-commerce, and foodtech for TechCrunch, and venture capital rounds for Crunchbase News. Based in Houston, Christine previously reported for the Houston Business Journal, the Texas Medical Center’s Pulse magazine, and Community Impact Newspaper. She has an undergraduate journalism degree from Murray State University and a graduate degree from The Ohio State University. At TechCrunch, Haje (He/Him) covered general tech news and focused mostly on hardware. He has founded several companies to varying degrees of success, spent a while in the VC world, and has been a journalist and TV producer since the dawn of his career. He is more-than-averagely interested in photography and can often be found with a camera slung over his shoulder.

    "content": "A Tesla Cybertruck that exploded and burst into flames Wednesday morning just outside the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas has left one person dead and seven people injured, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD). Matthew Alan Livelsberger, a 37-year-old man who was an active duty U.S. Army Green Beret from Colorado Springs, has been named as the primary suspect by investigators. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill, who provided new details during a Thursday media briefing, said Liveslberger’s military ID, credit cards, and passport were discovered in the Cybertruck. Livelsberger also has been identified as the person who rented the Cybertruck, and video at various Tesla Supercharging stations between Colorado and Las Vegas identify him as the driver. McMahill stopped short of conclusively naming Livelsberger as the individual who was killed and said they will wait for DNA to confirm his identity. The sheriff did say that the individual died of a self-inflicted gunshot moments before the explosion. The handgun was registered to Livelsberger. An eyewitness who captured video of the fire from inside the hotel lobby and posted it on X said the vehicle pulled up outside and then “blew up.” The video, and others like it, quickly spread on X. Law enforcement continues to investigate a number of leads, McMahill said. Gov. Joe Lombardo said his office was coordinating with LVMPD and partner agencies. During both media briefings, McMahill referenced the fatal attack that occurred Wednesday morning in New Orleans that killed at least 15 people. He didn’t make an implicit connection to the attack, but said law enforcement was taking precautions. “We’re very well aware of what has happened in New Orleans with the event that occurred there, and the number of victims there, and the additional IEDs,” he said during the Wednesday afternoon press conference. “So as you can imagine, with an explosion here on iconic Las Vegas Boulevard, we are taking all of the precautions that we need to take to keep our community safe.” In a briefing held late afternoon Wednesday, McMahill said the Cybertruck was rented in Colorado via peer-to-peer rental company Turo and driven to Las Vegas, arriving around 7:30 a.m. PT. McMahill also noted that the Ford truck in the New Orleans attack was rented via Turo. He called it a “coincidence” and said it was being investigated. Turo, which was founded in 2010 and has been compared to the Airbnb for cars, allows private car owners to rent out their vehicles through the startup’s website or app. The company, which filed for an IPO in 2022, was expected to go public this year. A Turo spokesperson told TechCrunch in an emailed statement the company is working with law enforcement. “We are heartbroken by the violence perpetrated in New Orleans and Las Vegas, and our prayers are with the victims and families. We are actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents,” the emailed statement said. “We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat. We remain committed to maintaining the highest standards in risk management, thanks to our world-class trust and safety technologies and teams that include experienced former law enforcement professionals.” McMahill said law enforcement was looking for secondary devices, adding there does not appear to be any further threat to the Las Vegas community. “If that changes, obviously you will hear directly from me to provide any update to you,” he said. Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted several notes on X, initially stating that the “whole senior Tesla team is investigating” the incident. “Will post more information as soon as we learn anything. We’ve never seen anything like this,” Musk wrote. Musk later posted that the vehicle was operating as normal, according to telemetry data he said the Tesla team viewed. “We have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself. All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion,” he wrote. McMahill personally thanked Musk for providing law enforcement with specific information about the operation of the Cybertruck as well as video from Tesla charging stations used by the individual. The incident comes as Musk, who also owns X, maintains a close connection to President-elect Donald Trump. A review of Musk’s flight data showed at least 31 flights to or from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property in Florida. This week, the NYT reported that Musk has been staying at a cottage on the Mar-a-Lago property. This article has been updated with new information, including that the explosion left one person dead and several injured, what contents were found in the vehicle, and images.

    "content": "Canva has acquired Leonardo.ai, a generative AI content and research startup, as the company looks to broaden the scope of its AI tech stack. The financial terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, but Canva co-founder and chief product officer Cameron Adams said it’s a mix of cash and stock. All of Leonardo.ai’s 120 employees will be joining Canva, including the executive team. “Leonardo will continue to run independently of Canva with a focus on rapid innovation, research and development, now backed by Canva’s resources,” Adams told TechCrunch. “We’ll keep offering all of Leonardo’s existing tools and solutions. This acquisition aims to help Leonardo develop its platform and deepen their user growth with our investment, including by expanding their API business and investing in foundational model R&D.” Sydney-based Leonardo.ai, founded in 2022, was originally meant to focus on video game asset creation — the startup’s founders met while working at a video game company. But then Leonardo.ai’s team decided to build out the platform to meet more scenarios, like creating and training AI models for image creation across industries such as fashion, advertising and architecture. Today, Leonardo.ai offers collaboration tools and a private cloud for models, including video generators, as well as access to APIs that let customers build their own tech infrastructure on top of Leonardo.ai’s platform. Leonardo.ai differentiates itself from other generative AI art platforms by the amount of control that it gives users, co-founders Jachin Bhasme, J.J. Fiasson and Chris Gillis told TechCrunch in an interview last December. For example, Leonardo.ai’s Live Canvas feature enables users to enter a text prompt and then make a quick sketch of what they want the end result to look like. As the user sketches, Leonardo.ai creates a photorealistic image based on both text and sketch prompts in real time. It’s unclear how Leonardo.ai trains its in-house generative models, like its flagship model Phoenix. It’s an important question to ask about any generative AI service, given the legal ramifications of training models on copyrighted content sans permission. Leonardo.ai’s PR kept it vague when we asked for clarification, saying only that the models are trained on “licensed, synthetic and publicly available/open source data.” Canva itself has been relatively supportive of creators in adopting generative AI, committing $200 million over the next several years to pay creators who consent to having their content used to train the company’s AI models. Leonardo.ai has over 19 million registered users, and its tools have been used to create more than a billion images. Adams says Leonardo.ai will help contribute to Canva’s Magic Studio generative AI suite. The company had raised over $38.8 million in capital from backers including Smash Capital, Blackbird, Side Stage Ventures, TIRTA Ventures, Gaorong Capital and Samsung Next prior to the acquisition. “We’ll look to integrate Leonardo’s technology into Magic Studio, which we’re very excited about,” Adams said. “This might include making existing Magic Studio tools more powerful, or introducing new generative AI capabilities powered by Leonardo’s models directly in Canva. It’s early days, and we’ll be coming together right away to determine how this looks, but we’re excited to expand what our users are able to do with AI on Canva.” Canva has been investing in generative AI tools since December 2022, beginning with the copywriting assistant Magic Write. But, eyeing an IPO, it has ramped up its development efforts in recent months through both internal projects and acquisitions. In February 2021, Canva acquired Kaleido, which makes a drag-and-drop background removal service for images and video. Adams said Kaleido laid the foundation for much of Canva’s more recent generative AI efforts. Leonardo.ai is Canva’s eighth acquisition overall and its second acquisition this year, coming three months after it bought U.K. design company Affinity for an estimated $380 million. Canva also owns presentations startup Zeetings, free stock photography sites Pixabay and Pexels, and Czech-based product mockup app Smartmockups. Canva, founded in 2012, has raised more than $560 million (most recently at a $26 billion valuation), and is pulling in close to $2 billion in revenue. It boasts over 180 million monthly users worldwide. “It’s a significant but natural next step in our efforts to build the most powerful, all-in-one visual AI offering,” Adams said. “We’ve placed a strong focus on building an AI-powered workflow that includes generative solutions like image and design generation. Pairing that Canva workflow with new generative capabilities will help us continue to set our AI offering apart, and deliver new possibilities for the growing base of teams and enterprises using Canva.” FLASH SALE ALERT: Register by Oct 17 and save up to $624 (or up to 30% on groups).Get the ticket type for you:Founders: Your next big connection and investor are here.Investors: Meet startups that align with your investment goals.Innovators & Visionaries: See the future of tech before everyone else.

    "content": "AI coding tools are getting better fast. If you don’t work in code, it can be hard to notice how much things are changing, but GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 have made a whole new set of developer tricks possible to automate, and last week Sonnet 4.5 did it again. At the same time, other skills are progressing more slowly. If you are using AI to write emails, you’re probably getting the same value out of it you did a year ago. Even when the model gets better, the product doesn’t always benefit — particularly when the product is a chatbot that’s doing a dozen different jobs at the same time. AI is still making progress, but it’s not as evenly distributed as it used to be. The difference in progress is simpler than it seems. Coding apps are benefiting from billions of easily measurable tests, which can train them to produce workable code. This is reinforcement learning (RL), arguably the biggest driver of AI progress over the past six months and getting more intricate all the time. You can do reinforcement learning with human graders, but it works best if there’s a clear pass-fail metric, so you can repeat it billions of times without having to stop for human input. As the industry relies increasingly on reinforcement learning to improve products, we’re seeing a real difference between capabilities that can be automatically graded and the ones that can’t. RL-friendly skills like bug-fixing and competitive math are getting better fast, while skills like writing make only incremental progress. In short, there’s a reinforcement gap — and it’s becoming one of the most important factors for what AI systems can and can’t do. In some ways, software development is the perfect subject for reinforcement learning. Even before AI, there was a whole sub-discipline devoted to testing how software would hold up under pressure — largely because developers needed to make sure their code wouldn’t break before they deployed it. So even the most elegant code still needs to pass through unit testing, integration testing, security testing, and so on. Human developers use these tests routinely to validate their code and, as Google’s senior director for dev tools recently told me, they’re just as useful for validating AI-generated code. Even more than that, they’re useful for reinforcement learning, since they’re already systematized and repeatable at a massive scale. There’s no easy way to validate a well-written email or a good chatbot response; these skills are inherently subjective and harder to measure at scale. But not every task falls neatly into “easy to test” or “hard to test” categories. We don’t have an out-of-the-box testing kit for quarterly financial reports or actuarial science, but a well-capitalized accounting startup could probably build one from scratch. Some testing kits will work better than others, of course, and some companies will be smarter about how to approach the problem. But the testability of the underlying process is going to be the deciding factor in whether the underlying process can be made into a functional product instead of just an exciting demo. Some processes turn out to be more testable than you might think. If you’d asked me last week, I would have put AI-generated video in the “hard to test” category, but the immense progress made by OpenAI’s new Sora 2 model shows it may not be as hard as it looks. In Sora 2, objects no longer appear and disappear out of nowhere. Faces hold their shape, looking like a specific person rather than just a collection of features. Sora 2 footage respects the laws of physics in both obvious and subtle ways. I suspect that, if you peeked behind the curtain, you’d find a robust reinforcement learning system for each of these qualities. Put together, they make the difference between photorealism and an entertaining hallucination. To be clear, this isn’t a hard and fast rule of artificial intelligence. It’s a result of the central role reinforcement learning is playing in AI development, which could easily change as models develop. But as long as RL is the primary tool for bringing AI products to market, the reinforcement gap will only grow bigger — with serious implications for both startups and the economy at large. If a process ends up on the right side of the reinforcement gap, startups will probably succeed in automating it — and anyone doing that work now may end up looking for a new career. The question of which healthcare services are RL-trainable, for instance, has enormous implications for the shape of the economy over the next 20 years. And if surprises like Sora 2 are any indication, we may not have to wait long for an answer.

    "content": "It was a futuristic week in tech as Facebook laid out its 10-year plan at F8, SpaceX landed a rocket on a drone ship in the middle of the ocean, and another $100 million was pledged to send spacecraft to Alpha Centauri. These are tech’s biggest headlines of the week. 1. Facebook held its annual F8 developer conference this week. Mark Zuckerberg laid out the 10-year roadmap for Facebook and announced chatbots for Messenger, the new open-source 360 Surround VR camera, the Live API and more. Josh Constine wrote about what it all means in “Facebook Alive” and Sarah Perez actually tried out the chatbots Facebook is currently partnered with. Here’s a roundup of everything announced at F8. 2. SpaceX successfully launched its next resupply mission to the International Space Station. In addition to a seamless launch, SpaceX landed the first stage of their Falcon 9 rocket on an autonomous drone ship for the very first time. 3. Russian billionaire Yuri Milner is pushing forward with the hunt for intelligent alien life beyond our planet, and is investing another $100 million to send a fleet of spacecraft to Alpha Centauri. Stephen Hawking and Mark Zuckerberg have signed on to invest, too. 4. We already knew that the FBI had successfully hacked the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone. But this week, it was reported that the iPhone was hacked using a zero-day exploit. The hack enabled the FBI to apparently use a custom-fabricated piece of hardware to brute-force all the possible four-digit passwords, eventually finding the correct PIN, and then accessing the contents on the San Bernardino iPhone. 5. New data surfaced showing that U.S. VC firms have gathered up the most money they’ve raised in a decade. In hard numbers, 57 firms raised $12 billion in the first quarter, a 59 percent jump in dollar commitments over the first quarter of 2015. 6. The situation for Theranos is getting worse. A federal agency plans to force founder Elizabeth Holmes out of the blood analysis startup for two years and take away the lab’s federal license. 7. Snapchat is bringing augmented reality to the masses with 3D stickers. Emojis can be pinned to objects in a video and stick with them no matter how they or your camera move. 8. We reviewed the HTC 10, and concluded that while it’s a solid phone, the company needs to convince mobile users they need it. 9. Cancer immunotherapy is Sean Parker’s next big bet. The Napster founder and former Facebook president persuaded hundreds of top scientists to form an alliance to solve cancer using cutting-edge immunotherapy. 10. We went hands-on with the Lytro Cinema, a volumetric 3D camera with capture technology that could eliminate the need for the green screen. 11. Natasha Lomas writes about the relentless nature of tech, and how the tech world is always searching for the next big thing. But what if the modern smartphone is as good as it gets for now? 12. We got a peek at Amazon’s new Oasis Kindle, the smallest and lightest Kindle yet that comes with a handle for gripping. 13. Ron Miller wrote about Autodesk’s Project Escher, a system that allows multiple 3D printing tools to work on one project simultaneously. Anna Escher manages Audience Development at TechCrunch.

    "content": "SpaceX has successfully launched its thirteenth rocket this year, and its eleventh Falcon 9 (the company also flew two Falcon Heavy missions in 2019). The launch included the re-use of a twice-flown Falcon 9 booster stage, which it recovered again with a landing at sea aboard one of its droneship landing pads, and a recovery attempt of both halves of the nose cone fairing that protects the spacecraft’s cargo and that is shed before the upper stage reaches its target orbit. This launch carried a Boeing-built satellite that was created to provide communications services for customers Kacific and SKY Perfect JSAT, and it seems to have delivered the payload to the target orbit as planned. But primary mission success is only half the story here — and the other half is key to SpaceX’s efforts to make even more of its launch system reusable over time. Elon Musk’s rocket company has been recovering Falcon 9 (and more recently, Super Heavy) boosters since 2015 and has done 47 successful first-stage recoveries in total, but its fairing catching system is a much more recent introduction. SpaceX first controlled the descent of and recovered a fairing half in 2017 — but did so by dropping it into the ocean. It later began attempting to recover it using a barge recovery ship to keep from having to fish it out of the sea, and managed to do that successfully for the first time with one half of the two-part fairing used in a Falcon Heavy launch this past June. The attempt to catch the fairings was not successful — SpaceX said on Twitter that both halves missed the waiting boats “narrowly,” but added that recovery teams will still seek to pull them from the ocean and see about re-using them on future missions. SpaceX re-flew a recovered fairing in November for the first time, and Musk has said previously that re-use of this part could save SpaceX as much as $6 million per mission, which is around 10% of the total cost of launch.

More importantly, SpaceX successfully completed the primary mission of today’s launch by inserting their payload, the JCSAT-16 satellite, into Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO).

To date, the only time SpaceX has made a rocket recovery attempt back on land has been on missions to the much closer altitude of Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The successfully deployed payload is known as JCSAT-16 and is a commercial communications satellite developed by Space Systems Loral for the SKY Perfect JSAT Corporation. It will become part of a 16-satellite constellation used to provide data-transfer communications and video distribution in the Asia-Pacific region. 5 mins to liftoff of SpaceX Falcon 9 w/ JCSat-16 Sky Perfect JSat of Japan's JCSat-16. Here's sat before shipment. pic.twitter.com/97z1VQWfzF — Peter B. de Selding (@pbdes) August 14, 2016 With tonight’s booster included SpaceX has made a total of eleven rocket recovery attempts, six of which have been successful. Two of these boosters were recovered on land, and now four have been recovered on a drone ship out at sea. Sea-based landings are considered more difficult, but depending on SpaceX’s mission parameters, the drone ship is often their best (sometimes their only) option for a recovery attempt. Over the course of the last year and a half, SpaceX has learned a lot from their failed recovery attempts. Sometimes the rocket came in too hot, didn’t have enough hydraulic fluid left to control its descent, or one of the landing legs didn’t lock properly causing the rocket to tip over. But if the last five months are any indicator, SpaceX has learned quickly and is starting to get the hang of it. Since April, Musk’s company has successfully executed five out of the last six rocket recovery attempts. So far, none of the recovered rockets have been reused on a second mission into space. However, last month one of their recovered boosters went through a test fire, SpaceX’s first test fire of a recovered rocket. While this particular rocket test will provide SpaceX with useful performance data, it won’t have the honor of flying again. That privilege will be given to the recovered booster from a May mission to the International Space Station on a yet-to-be-determined date later this year. This year is an especially important one for SpaceX because they’ve set out to triple the number of missions they can get off the ground compared to last year. Back in March, SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell stated that they hope to launch a total of eighteen times this year. By itself, eighteen missions may sound like a small number, but considering there were only 82 successful orbital launches in the entire world in 2015, an increase from six to eighteen launches from a single company is pretty remarkable. Tonight’s launch was SpaceX’s eighth mission this year, meaning they’ll have to pick up the pace if they want to meet their lofty goal. With their next launch just a short three weeks away, it seems that Musk and company are already working to do just that.

    "content": "On Sunday morning, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket broke apart nearly 30 miles above Cape Canaveral just a few minutes after launch, marking its first full mission failure. The rocket was taking the Dragon capsule, carrying more than 4,000 pounds of supplies, to the International Space Station (ISS). SpaceX had previously completed six successful resupply missions to the ISS, the latest one in April. While there were no humans on board and no accidents on the ground, the lost cargo contained over 4,000 pounds of food, water, and science experiments for the crew on station. William Gerstenmaier, NASA associate administrator for human exploration and operations, stated that the ISS crew will be fine and has sufficient supplies for the next four months. The next ISS resupply mission is scheduled to launch on July 3rd with the Russian Progress 60P vehicle. The exact cause of the Falcon 9 failure is unknown at this time, but Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX tweeted: There was an overpressure event in the upper stage liquid oxygen tank. Data suggests counterintuitive cause. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 28, 2015 In the NASA press briefing following the accident, SpaceX was asked if there was anything that was done differently for this launch than in the previous six launches. SpaceX’s president, Gwynne Shotwell, responded, “There’s nothing that stands out as being different for this particular flight.” SpaceX will now lead an accident investigation, making use of telemetry from 3,000 different channels that were transmitting information during the launch. “If there’s something there, we’re going to find it,” Shotwell said. An unlucky series of events makes this the third failed resupply mission to the ISS in the past eight months. An Orbital Sciences resupply mission failed in October, the exact cause of which continues to be disputed. And in May, a Russian resupply mission was placed in the wrong orbit, forcing its cargo to burn up in the Earth’s atmosphere. In addition to providing supplies to the ISS, this launch was going to be SpaceX’s third attempt to softly land the first stage of their two-stage Falcon 9 on a platform in the sea. If they succeeded, it would have been the first time a rocket has ever been fully recovered for reuse. About ten minutes after launch, SpaceX intended to detach the first stage of the Falcon 9 from the upper stage and cargo, flip the first stage 180 degrees, have it reenter into the Earth’s atmosphere faster than the speed of sound, and steer it to a floating barge in the sea. If that sounds difficult, it’s because it is. SpaceX’s first two attempts at this complex strategy impressively ended up on target. However, they both resulted in violent explosions. The first attempt occurred in January and failed because the rocket prematurely ran out of the hydraulic fluid used to steer the small fins that help control the rocket’s descent. Because of this, it landed with too much lateral force and exploded on impact. The second attempt, packed with more hydraulic fluid, occurred in April and was much closer to sticking the landing. The hydraulic fluid and controlled descent weren’t an issue, however the rocket engine fired a few seconds longer than it should have. These critical seconds caused the rocket to temporarily lose control in the last few moments before landing, ultimately tipping over and exploding. SpaceX posted that they understood the cause of this failed landing well, and have made “changes to help prevent, and be able to rapidly recover from, similar issues for the next attempt.” As this Sunday’s launch has shown, a standard rocket launch is difficult enough without adding in the complexity of reusability. So why has SpaceX dedicated more time, effort, and money to this strategy? The goal is to revolutionize the business of rocket launches. All rockets launched today are mostly expendable after just one flight. It’s like an airline throwing a jumbo jet away after a one-way trip across the country. If that were the norm, all airlines would jack up ticket prices so that only the elite few could afford to fly. SpaceX aims to change that strategy, and they’re not the only companies working to do so. Blue Origin is testing a reusable suborbital rocket called New Shepard which will be used for space tourism. SpaceX and Blue Origin have been the only companies to actually test a reusable rocket so far. However, back in April, one of SpaceX’s biggest competitors announced plans to join the rocket reusability club. United Launch Alliance (ULA), which competes with SpaceX for large government contracts, released plans for their new rocket, the Vulcan. This is undoubtedly an attempt to find a better way to match SpaceX unprecedented low launch prices. The Vulcan is early in the concept design phase, but will eventually be reused in a completely different manner than the Falcon 9. Rather than recovering the first stage from a vertical landing, it will attempt to capture the most expensive parts of the rocket in mid-air using a helicopter. This may sound crazy, but it is actually a technique the US Air Force used back in the 1960’s to recover film canisters from orbiting satellites. While ULA is further behind in their development of a reusable rocket, the company has launched 96 missions with only two partial failures since 2006. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 has launched 19 times with one partial, and as of Sunday, one full failure since 2010. In an industry where reliability trumps all else, ULA now has the edge. The race for reliability and innovation continues among private companies in the space industry. While this failure was certainly a setback for NASA and SpaceX, both parties have expressed determination in finding the root cause and returning back to flight as quickly as possible.

    "content": "SpaceX has a few answers about what might have caused the explosion of one of its Falcon 9 rockets on September 1. The rocket blew up while going through pre-launch prep on a landing pad, and no one was injured, but SpaceX has had some difficulty figuring out the cause, and shared very little info before now. Today, an update on the SpaceX blog says that the results of an investigation which included SpaceX, the FAA, NASA and the Air Force point to a breach in the rocket’s cryogenic helium system, which is part of the second stage rocket component’s liquid oxygen tank and a key part of any liquid-propellant rocket design, as the likely cause. This means, for one, that this error isn’t related to the explosion that happened mid-flight with 2015’s CRS-7 Falcon 9 incident, according to SpaceX. That’s good news, as is the fact that LC-40 (the landing pad in question) seems to be relatively unaffected by the explosion overall, beyond the pad systems itself. Support facilities and buildings nearby remain “intact” and “in good working order,” according to SpaceX, as are the control systems for the landing pad itself. Meanwhile, SpaceX also says its manufacturing and production teams and facilities at its Hawthorne factory HQ have been “exonerated” by the investigation, meaning business continues there as usual with production of new rockets and components. While the investigation team has identified the above-mentioned helium system as the source, it still needs to investigate the cause of why the breach took place to begin with. SpaceX says that it sees November as the window for returning to flight operations, however, pending resolution of its inquiry.

    "content": "Over the weekend, SpaceX revealed that there was no damage found on their recovered Falcon 9 and it was ready to be fired again. SpaceX CEO, Elon Musk, shared some of the first photos of the rocket from a hangar at Cape Canaveral. The recovered Falcon 9 was launched to space on December 21st and brought back safely to the ground. Many labeled this achievement as a game changer for the rocket industry. Elon can’t say this, but “nail in the coffin” for traditional launch industry. No way to compete with Falcon-Reusability & performance. — Peter Diamandis (@PeterDiamandis) December 22, 2015 Falcon 9 back in the hangar at Cape Canaveral. No damage found, ready to fire again. https://t.co/7w6IfJGtXM — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 1, 2016 Musk tweeted that the recovered rocket was ready to fire again. However, it’s not likely to be used for another launch. Instead, it will simply be used in a static fire test. In a press call after the successful landing, Musk said, “I think we’ll probably keep this one on the ground, just… it’s kind of unique, it’s the first one we’ve brought back.” To many, this recovered rocket is a national treasure and belongs in a museum. To SpaceX, it’s the first rocket they’ve successfully brought back after a mission. They probably want to test the hell out of it to understand exactly what happens to a rocket after it’s launched and recovered. These tests could put the rocket through its paces and it may be too risky to use it for another launch. If the first recovered rocket failed on its second flight, it would place an enormous setback on the path to rocket reusability. A static fire test means that the rocket will be held down to the ground as the engines are fired and analyzed. SpaceX will use this test to verify that the recovered rocket would work in the event that they wanted to use it for a second flight. Musk has stated that within the next year they plan to launch over a dozen flights and that they will “probably” try to re-fly one of their recovered boosters in the same time-frame. So it may be a while before we see a recovered rocket used for a second flight. The reasons to be patient with reusing a rocket are obvious. Placing a multi-million dollar payload on top of a mint condition rocket is risky enough. Future SpaceX customers will want undeniable proof that their ride to space is in perfect condition before betting their payload on it. The image of the returned rocket may be enough to make future customers nervous. A launch is an intense experience and the image of the retrieved rocket shows that much of it is covered in soot. We can compare this image to a photo of the rocket prior to launch. The dark parts on the rocket after launch are due to soot accumulated from the launch. The clean, triangular white spaces along the bottom end were created by the landing legs that were folded up during launch. Some have theorized that the clean space around the middle may be due to the liquid oxygen (LOX) tank that’s held there. The LOX would keep that part of the rocket very cold and prevent hot ash from scorching or sticking to that area. SpaceX isn’t the only company working on rocket reusability. In November, Jeff Bezos’ company, Blue Origin, also brought their rocket, New Shepard, back to the ground in a less technically difficult landing after launching it to space. And in April, the United Launch Alliance announced early plans of their own reusable rocket, the Vulcan. Reusable rockets are expected to cut launch costs by more than half. Musk has stated that the cost of a Falcon 9 is around $60 million to manufacture while the fuel itself is only $200,000. But the path to rocket reusability will be a long one, and it’s going to get more expensive before it gets cheaper. Safely landing the rocket is simply the first step. SpaceX will need to conduct further tests to prove that recovered rockets are consistently reliable. Safely retrieving a rocket after a launch (rather than tossing it away in the ocean) has clear cost benefits. But for any type of savings to be realized, a customer will need to purchase a launch on a recovered SpaceX Falcon 9. Safely returning a rocket to Earth after it’s been to space is impressive alone, but securing companies willing to put their products on a reused rocket will be the necessary key to unlock the benefits of reusability.

    "content": "Elon Musk had an eventful 2024, what with his hard push into right-wing politics and leveraging his X social media platform and considerable influence to help Donald Trump win the presidential election. Putting politics aside for a moment, it’s worth focusing on another Musk pastime: making promises for Tesla. The Tesla CEO’s promises — and repeated missed deadlines — have become a primary thread in the Tesla storyline. And they’ve always had an eye-popping quality that captured the imagination of investors and helped drive up the value of Tesla stock, giving the company a valuation of $1.3 trillion. There was his claim in 2015 that Tesla vehicles would be self-driving in two years, that cross-country driverless road-trips would be enabled by the end of 2017, and that Tesla owners would be able to earn money via a massive driverless ride-hailing network in 2020. And while Tesla has cemented its place in history books thanks to building and selling millions of electric vehicles, none of the above promises (nor many others) have come to pass. But that hasn’t stopped Musk from making more promises in 2024. Here’s an accounting of those promises and when he expects them to become reality. In 2024 alone, Musk pledged to unveil a $25,000 EV, then scrapped it in April to prioritize a robotaxi prototype — a decision that led to mass layoffs as Tesla pursued its “next phase of growth.” Musk has flip-flopped on whether the affordable EV would ever come to market. But during Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, Musk said the idea of building a $25,000 car with a steering wheel and pedals is “pointless” and “silly.” He said the only car he’d sell at that price point would be the Cybercab. During the call, an analyst asked if Tesla would make a lower-cost EV that’s not the Cybercab, and Musk replied that all of the company’s cars moving forward would be autonomous. He also said that of the 7 million vehicles Tesla has built to date, the “vast majority” are “capable of autonomy,” and that Tesla is “currently making on the order of 35,000 autonomous vehicles a week.” Musk is clearly using a loose definition of autonomy here, because Tesla still does not produce vehicles that are safe to use without a human behind the wheel. (Flashback: Musk originally promised in 2016, in a since-deleted post on Tesla’s website, that “All Tesla Cars Being Produced Now Have Full Self-Driving Hardware,” and that only a software update would be needed to turn regular old Teslas into self-driving cars. That didn’t happen, and Tesla has had to upgrade cars with older hardware.) It’s also worth noting that during that earnings call, Musk said that he expects vehicle growth to reach 20% to 30% in 2025 due to “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” Tesla unveiled 20 Cybercab prototypes at a flashy Hollywood event in October, and Musk took the opportunity to share some plans for the vehicles, as well as Tesla’s so-called Full Self-Driving (FSD) software. FSD is Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system that can perform many automated driving tasks, but still requires a human to remain attentive behind the wheel and take over if needed. Musk told customers they would be able to one day buy a robotaxi — a two-door, two-seat vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals — for less than $30,000. He also said that the average operating cost of the Cybercab will reduce over time to only $0.20 per mile. And he said Tesla would start production on the purpose-built AVs in 2025 or 2026. (Flashback: Musk said in 2022 that Tesla would mass-produce robotaxis by 2024. Before that, in 2019, he said that Tesla would have a million robotaxis on roads by 2020. Musk has promised that Tesla would solve full self-driving “next year” since at least 2016.) A few weeks later, during Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, Musk said Tesla would reach “volume production in ’26,” and that the company was eventually “aiming for at least 2 million units a year of Cybercab.” Current federal regulations that require vehicles to be built with certain safety standards, like manual human controls, could be roadblocks for Tesla to mass produce its Cybercabs. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recently proposed new rules that would fast-track exemptions for such vehicles, but they would require companies to share more data with the agency, like crash reporting. Today, automakers are required to report crashes when ADAS or autonomous driving tech is engaged. Musk has railed against the rule before, and President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team is reportedly exploring scrapping it. During Tesla’s robotaxi reveal, the company also showed investors a Robovan prototype. At the time Musk didn’t share any concrete plans for the vehicle, but in November he posted on X that the Robovan is in development, along with “some other things.” (Flashback: In 2016, Musk said Tesla would start building a minibus using the Model X chassis in two to three years.) At the event, Musk also promised that Model 3 and Model Y owners would be able to use an “unsupervised” version of FSD in California and Texas in 2025. It wasn’t, and still isn’t, clear what Musk meant by “unsupervised” FSD. Today, Tesla’s FSD is still not fully autonomous, and to dispel any confusion, Tesla this year began referring to the software as “supervised FSD.” Removing the supervision could mean that Tesla plans to remove the driver, or it could mean that Tesla plans to offer a Level 3 autonomous system that allows drivers to go hands-off, eyes-off for a portion of their ride. During Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, Musk took the promise of unsupervised FSD a step further. He said he hopes to launch a service that will let people hail self-driving Teslas in California and Texas in 2025. He also claimed Tesla had begun testing the service in the Bay Area with employees. (Context: There are several tiers of permits required to test and deploy autonomous vehicles in California. Tesla has held a permit to test AVs with a safety driver in the front seat since 2015, but the Department of Motor Vehicles told TechCrunch in October that Tesla last reported using that permit in 2019.) It’s not clear if Tesla plans to launch this ride-hail service with its robotaxis or with existing Tesla Model 3 and Model Y owners. Tesla’s first-quarter earnings presentation included a mock-up of a future Tesla ride-hail app, and the company has for years teased the idea of a ride-hailing network using Teslas that had been updated to drive fully autonomously. The idea is similar to Uber, only Tesla owners would add their properly equipped self-driving vehicles to the automaker’s ride-hailing app to make extra cash when the cars are not in use. Tesla would take 25% to 30% of the revenue. Finally, during Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call, Musk said Tesla was in talks with a “major automaker” to license FSD, but so far has not announced any such deals. Musk has made some out-there promises about Optimus, Tesla’s humanoid robot. During Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting, Musk promised that Tesla would move into “limited production” of the Optimus next year, with “over 1,000, or a few thousand, Optimus robots working at Tesla” in 2025. He also said he expects Optimus to be on sale by 2026. In a post on X, the billionaire executive added that he expects to have more Optimus bots available for use by other companies in 2026. He did not specify if the bots would be working fully autonomously, or if they would be remotely controlled by humans, as they were during Tesla’s robotaxi reveal event in October. (Context: While humanoid robots are improving to the point of being able to autonomously complete specific tasks, many experts say generalized robotics is still years away due to a lack of training data.) Aside from manufacturing promises, Musk also predicted that Optimus could one day lift Tesla’s market cap to $25 trillion. That’s roughly seven times the current market caps of Apple and Nvidia. At the end of December, Tesla’s market cap was around $1.42 trillion, which is almost a 160% increase from the $550 billion market cap before Trump won the presidential election.

    "content": "Lucid Motors CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson had a clear vision for how to take an electric car to another level. The former chief engineer of the Tesla Model S just didn’t expect it to take quite so long. Today, nearly four years since the company first announced its intentions to produce electric vehicles, Lucid Motors revealed the final version of its all-electric luxury Air sedan. The Air has eye-popping performance specs, an estimated range of up to 517 miles and a design that manages to balance technology and luxury without feeling opulent or cluttered. Two of the four variants — the $169,000 flagship Dream edition and a $139,000 Grand Touring model — will go into production first at its new factory in Casa Grande, Arizona this year. Deliveries of these variants are slated to begin in spring 2021. Two other variants, a Touring model priced at $95,000 and a base model that’s a smidge below $80,000, are expected at the end of 2021 and into 2022, respectively. (All prices are before the $7,500 federal tax credit is accounted for.) The Air is meant to be an EV replacement to the Mercedes S Class — an electric vehicle category that Rawlinson says has not existed until now. “Tesla (Model S) is premium, it’s beautifully engineered and it’s super disruptive, but it is not an S Class Mercedes replacement in the EV space and that’s what we’re offering,” Rawlinson said in a recent interview ahead of the September 9 reveal. The Air is dripping with luxury in an understated way. It’s spacious inside the cabin, the result of what Rawlinson and VP of design Derek Jenkins have described as a clean sheet approach. The company has “redefined the three-dimensional puzzle that is a car through the miniaturization of electric powertrain and that’s making the space concept work, where the car is more compact on the outside, and bigger on the inside,” Rawlinson said, who added that it’s shorter and narrower than the Tesla Model S or the Porsche Taycan. The vehicle’s four variants offer a variety of performance levels all via its dual-motor, all-wheel drive architecture. The Dream edition boasts 1,080 horsepower and can travel from zero to 60 mph acceleration in 2.5 seconds. As a result of the power, the Dream edition has 465 miles of range. Meanwhile, the Grand Touring has 800 horsepower and can hit that same acceleration in 3 seconds, but has the highest range of 517 miles. The Air will be loaded with 32 sensors, a driver-monitoring system and an Ethernet-based architecture all for its advanced driver assistance system, which is designed to support hands-free driving on highways. Inside, a 34-inch curved glass 5K display sits in front of the driver, and appears to float above the dashboard. Another center touchscreen is retractable, revealing more storage. Meanwhile, a few physical controls remain on the steering wheel and just above the center screen to control volume and activate the ADAS and Amazon Alexa, which is integrated into the vehicle. Below that center touchscreen and moving to the console is a spot for inductive charging, cup holders and USB-C ports, along with additional storage. Owners of the Air will have an app that will control and communicate with the car, such as locking and unlocking the vehicle. But it will also be equipped with facial recognition that confirms the identity of the owner. It’s been an epic journey for the company that started in 2007 with a different name and mission. Lucid began as Atieva, a company founded by former Tesla VP and board member Bernard Tse and entrepreneur Sam Weng that focused on developing electric car battery technology. That early work would be critically important for the Lucid Motors of today because of the early research, development and eventual progress in the components and overall electric architecture, Rawlinson told TechCrunch. Atieva would go on to become the battery supplier to Formula E, which would also help the company make gains on the design and performance. But it was in the waning months of 2016 that Lucid came out with a bang and a new publicly stated purpose to make electric vehicles (although the company had already been working quietly at this for a couple of years). Rawlinson, who left Tesla to join Lucid in 2013 as CTO, was one of the driving forces behind this new mission. He later took on the CEO title and responsibility as well. In those early days, Lucid looked well on its way to the difficult and expensive task of becoming a car manufacturer. “Who would be crazy enough to start a car company?” Rawlinson told TechCrunch recently. “We came out in early 2017 with high hopes and it took us longer to find the right investor.” That is a slight understatement. Soon after the name change, Lucid announced it would build a factory in Arizona and showed off an alpha prototype of the Air (in which I rode in late 2017). But then progress on capturing investors slowed and then stalled altogether. “At that stage, I think the investment community was in love with the idea of autonomous driving and robotaxis,” Rawlinson said. “No one believed there was still some mileage to getting a better electric car. And I kept plugging that it hasn’t been done yet. Tesla’s doing a great job, but they haven’t really cracked it, there’s so much more that can come out of the electric car — and it fell on deaf ears.” It would take months to land an investor, putting the factory project in limbo. “Those were our darkest hours as a company,” Rawlinson recalled. In September 2018, Lucid announced that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund had committed to invest $1 billion into the company. The announcement came just six weeks after Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share and had secured the proper funding to make the leap. Musk suggested that Saudi’s wealth fund, which already owns almost 5% of Tesla stock, was interested in backing the company’s move from public to private. The $1 billion investment deal between Lucid and the Saudi wealth fund closed in spring 2019. The funding was used to complete engineering development and testing of the Lucid Air, construct its factory in Arizona, begin the global rollout of its retail strategy starting in North America and enter production. With the Air finally on display, Lucid now must turn its attention to the next task — production and delivery rollout.

    "content": "Elon Musk tweeted Saturday a ChatGPT conversation that speculated about the 2019 transition of its creator, OpenAI, from a nonprofit to a for-profit organization. The AI chatbot concluded that, if the for-profit business had used the nonprofit’s resources for the change, it would have been “highly unethical and illegal.” It appears that Musk and ChatGPT didn’t have all the facts. Tax filings seen by TechCrunch indicate the original OpenAI nonprofit retained control over all of its financial assets, totaling tens of millions of dollars, meaning none of its money was used to spin out the organization’s commercial enterprises. The interesting part is where that money ended up: financing Universal Basic Income pilots aiming to fix the very problems OpenAI’s technologies seem to be creating. And that’s just one thread in a web of commercial investments and nonprofits that all tie back to Sam Altman, best known as a co-founder of startup accelerator Y Combinator and OpenAI — the nonprofit he started with Musk. His investments span a dozen industries, from nuclear fusion and supersonic planes to molecular diagnostics and crypto, but key among his wider interests are a collection of nonprofits, run by Altman and his close friends. The story of this family of nonprofits illustrates how a small group of like-minded entrepreneurs can leverage their charitable donations to not only support their personal causes, but to further commercial interests and possibly even accelerate the transformation of society. It’s far from unusual for tech entrepreneurs to have a charitable foundation or two to distribute their wealth exactly how they wish. But Altman’s commercial and charitable dealings are more intertwined than most. Altman controls at least two nonprofits, OpenAI and OpenResearch, and has provided funding to a third, not previously reported, known as UBI Charitable. UBI Charitable’s mission is to research and deploy Universal Basic Income (UBI) programs — the no-strings-attached payouts scheme that futurists like Altman and Musk believe will be necessary when advances in robotics and AI, similar to those being developed by the two technologists, render many human occupations unprofitable. It is already funding at least two UBI schemes. Understanding the connections and the flows of money between Altman’s businesses and charities means going back to 2015. That was the year that Altman co-founded OpenAI with Musk, Reid Hoffman and others, as a 501c3 organization to safely and transparently pursue AI research. It was also the year he spun out a separate nonprofit research lab from Y Combinator that would ultimately be called OpenResearch. This research lab was launched to tackle work that required a very long time horizon, sought to answer open-ended questions or develop technology that Altman thought should not be owned by any one company. “We’re not doing this with the goal of helping YC’s startups succeed or adding to our bottom line,” wrote Altman on Y Combinator’s blog at the time. “At the risk of sounding cliché, this is for the benefit of the world.” He claimed in the blog that he would start off by personally donating $10 million to OpenResearch and raise more money later. A filing with the IRS shows that the lab in fact received only $1 million in donations in 2016. Funding for OpenResearch initially lagged, but would eventually top $10 million by 2019. The source of that money was not specified. OpenResearch has received a total of nearly $24.5 million in funding since it was established, according to tax filings. Altman also provided a $5.2 million loan to the organization in 2016, and increased that year by year. Altman had loaned OpenResearch a total of $14 million by the end of 2021, according to the latest records (although he has forgiven some of the debt). The 2016 filing also claimed that OpenResearch had already made “significant progress” in such diverse areas as programming languages, simulation systems, physical/virtual user interfaces, computer-mediated student-teacher interaction and virtual reality. OpenResearch kept a low profile in its early years. That changed with the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, as the virus was shutting down America, Altman tweeted a call for help with clinical trials of potential therapies, that connected him to computational biologist Benjamine Liu, a founder of TrialSpark. OpenResearch provided TrialSpark with a $1 million grant to help set up Project Covalence, a platform to support COVID-19 trials in community settings or at patients’ homes. The project’s website stated: “The world doesn’t have time to waste. By coordinating efforts, sharing resources, and streamlining logistics, we can halt the spread of COVID-19 together.” At least one trial did take place, not for an actual therapy, but for a remote diagnostic test for COVID antibodies. The trial in the summer of 2020 was a success, gathering high-quality samples and positive feedback from participants. And yet, by late summer 2021, Project Covalence’s website disappeared. Not long after, Altman led a $156 million Series C investment in the company. TrialSpark’s valuation would pop to $1 billion by the time the round closed. “When donors give, and then benefit from their donations, arguably they are not promoting the public good, but rather their own good,” says Patricia Illingworth, a philosophy professor at Northeastern University and author of “Giving Now,” a book about the ethics of philanthropy. “I am reminded of the practice of parents donating to the schools their children attend. The donation has an element of self-dealing to it.” TrialSpark provided the following statement: “We wound down Project Covalence as vaccines and therapies were authorized and approved. We had no concerns about OpenResearch’s contribution to Project Covalence and Sam’s investment in TrialSpark because they are two separate things.” Altman could not be reached for comment, but a spokesperson for OpenResearch supplied a statement along similar lines: “Project Covalence was part of a number of efforts during the pandemic, a project that the OpenResearch board felt would be beneficial to the public at that time. It is important to note that Project Covalence is different from TrialSpark.” A press release issued by TrialSpark itself in July 2020 described Project Covalence as a platform of TrialSpark. By 2020, OpenResearch had largely abandoned its work on user interfaces and virtual reality. Aside from its one-off grant to TrialSpark, OpenResearch’s attention and funds would now be dedicated to UBI research. In a lengthy 2021 essay, Altman predicted that AI technologies might be able to pay every American $13,500 a year by 2031, and “that dividend could be much higher if AI accelerates growth.” Last year, he tweeted in favor of a $25 minimum wage: “I think it’s good to force the issue on automating jobs we aren’t willing to pay that much for anyway. Long term, I still think this is all the wrong framing and we will probably need something like UBI.” And he was ready to put his nonprofit’s money where his mouth was. Altman drew funds in 2021 from OpenAI and made a $75,000 grant to OpenResearch to work on UBI. That work involves designing and evaluating UBI programs, and advising other groups. It makes sense that Altman turned to OpenAI to fund other projects. After all, OpenAI has had no difficulty in attracting donors. By 2018, it had raked in nearly $100 million to fund research projects into AI gaming, training a dexterous robot hand, organizing machine conferences and building out its AI safety team. But it had yet to make any external grants. The same year, Musk surrendered his board seat, citing possible conflicts of interests with Tesla’s AI efforts. In 2019, most of OpenAI’s 125 employees transferred over to a new for-profit business, confusingly also called OpenAI, that would seek to commercialize the technologies it had developed, including the GPT large language models and text-to-image generators. Microsoft invested $1 billion, alongside other investors and VCs. But the original nonprofit still had $30 million in the bank. With its AI technologies spun off, it now started to make grants, starting with modest contributions to organizations such as the ACLU, Black Girls Code and Campaign Zero — a nonprofit seeking to end police violence. Then in 2020, the original OpenAI gave away $10 million, nearly one-third of its assets, in a previously unreported donation to a nonprofit called UBI Charitable, launched that same year. UBI Charitable does not have a website, or any salaried employees or volunteers, and its address is identical to that of OpenResearch. A tax filing with the state of California reveals that UBI Charitable’s “primary and only currently planned activity will be grant-making to organizations that run universal basic income programs, and other policies and programs aimed at broadly distributing the benefits of technological advancement.” UBI Charitable’s president and treasurer is Altman’s long-time friend and ex-Mountain View mayor, Chris Clark. Clark is also director of OpenResearch, as well as head of strategy at OpenAI itself. UBI Charitable’s only other income in 2020, a $15 million donation, came via a donor-advised fund that protects its originator’s identity. It received another $5.3 million in 2021. UBI Charitable started spending almost immediately. Since 2020, it has given $8.3 million to CitySquare, an anti-poverty charity in Dallas, and another $8.2 million to Heartland Alliance, a similar organization in Chicago that is already running a UBI pilot, called Chicago Resilient Communities. At the end of 2021, the most recent year for which tax records are available, UBI Charitable was sitting on assets of nearly $15 million. The ethics of both funding AI, a technology that could lead to job losses, and providing for people whose livelihoods it threatens, are undeniably complex. AI technology itself can see two sides to Altman’s actions. When TechCrunch asked ChatGPT, it noted: “If the entrepreneur’s nonprofit is creating a tool that could lead to job loss, he or she may be seen as having a responsibility to mitigate the harm that could result. By funding another nonprofit to provide support for those who may lose their jobs, the entrepreneur may be seen as fulfilling this responsibility.” However, the AI system went on: “If the entrepreneur’s actions are motivated by a desire to protect his or her financial interests, rather than a genuine concern for those who may be impacted by the tool, this could be seen as a conflict of interest and potentially unethical.” Of course, no one should rely on legal or ethical advice from a chatbot, and as Illingworth notes: “We want billionaires to give away their money as fast as they can.” Whether Altman is trying to stay ahead of a coming technological tsunami, covering his ass, or some combination of the two, the net result is still millions of dollars being funneled to people in financial need. What remains to be seen is whether Altman’s UBI charity keeps pace with the changes AI seems likely to bring, and the profits ChatGPT seems likely to generate, in the years to come.",

    "content": "There is “reasonable evidence” to conclude that Tesla and its officers, including CEO Elon Musk, knew its vehicles had defective Autopilot systems but still allowed the cars to be driven in areas “not safe for that technology,” a Florida judge found. The ruling last week from Judge Reid Scott, in the Circuit Court for Palm Beach County, means the family of a man who died in a collision while his Tesla’s Autopilot was engaged can go to trial and seek punitive damages from Tesla for intentional misconduct and gross negligence. Reuters first reported the news. The hit to Tesla comes after the electric vehicle maker won two product liability cases in California earlier this year over the safety of its Autopilot system. Autopilot is Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system that can perform automated driving tasks like navigating on and off highway ramps, cruise control, lane changes and automatic parking. The Florida lawsuit was the result of a 2019 crash north of Miami. Owner Stephen Banner’s Model 3 drove under the trailer of an 18-wheeler that had turned onto the road, cutting off the Tesla’s roof and killing Banner. A trial that was set for October has been delayed and has yet to be rescheduled. When the case goes to trial, it might reveal new information about the reams of data Tesla collects, information that is usually top secret. Judge Scott’s finding that managers at Tesla’s top knew of the defects could also mean Musk would have to testify. The judge said that Tesla’s marketing strategy painted the products as autonomous and Musk’s public statements about Autopilot “had a significant effect on the belief about the capabilities of the products,” according to the ruling. The judge pointed to a misleading 2016 video, which Musk was found to have overseen, that purported to show a Tesla being driven completely autonomously by the Autopilot system. The billionaire entrepreneur was not required to sit for a deposition after a judge rejected the Banners’ argument that Musk had “unique knowledge” of the issues of the case. The judge compared Banner’s crash to a similar 2016 fatal crash involving Joshua Brown in which Autopilot failed to detect crossing trucks, which led to the vehicle crashing into the side of a tractor trailer at high speed. The judge also based his finding on testimony given by Autopilot engineer Adam Gustafsson and Dr. Mary “Missy” Cummings, director of the Autonomy and Robotics Center at George Mason University. Gustafsson, who was the investigator on both Banner’s and Brown’s crashes, testified that Autopilot in both cases failed to detect the semitrailer and stop the vehicle. The engineer further testified that despite Tesla being aware of the problem, no changes were made to the cross-traffic detection warning system from the date of Brown’s crash until Banner’s crash to account for cross traffic. The judge wrote in his ruling that the testimony of other Tesla engineers leads to the reasonable conclusion that Musk, who was “intimately involved” in the development of Autopilot, was “acutely aware” of the problem and failed to remedy it. A Tesla spokesperson could not be reached to comment. As Tesla has done in the past, the automaker will likely argue that Banner’s crash was the result of human error. A National Transportation Safety Board probe into the accident found that there was blame to go around — according to the investigation, the truck driver had failed to yield right of way and Banner was inattentive due to over-reliance on Autopilot. But the NTSB also found that Autopilot didn’t send a visual or audible warning to the driver to put his hands back on the wheel, according to Bloomberg. Tesla’s lawyers may rely on the precedent set in two previous cases this year, from which the automaker emerged victorious. In April, Tesla secured a win after a California jury determined the automaker was not to blame for a 2019 crash involving Autopilot. Plaintiff Justine Hsu sued Tesla in 2020 for fraud, negligence and breach of contract, but was awarded no damages. A few weeks ago, a jury sided with Tesla over allegations that Autopilot led to the death of Tesla driver Micah Lee in 2019. The two plaintiffs, survivors of the crash, alleged that Tesla knew its product was defective and sought $400 million in damages. Tesla argued that the crash was the result of human error. The case — No. 50-2019-CA-009962 — is being tried in the Circuit Court for Palm Beach County, Florida.

    "content": "Tesla has spent more than a year teasing that “more affordable models” of its vehicles were on the way, and on Tuesday, the company finally revealed them. The company is now selling a more bare-bones version of the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y SUV, which start at $36,990 and $39,990, respectively. The new versions, each dubbed “Standard,” get an estimated 321 miles of range on a full battery, and will come with fewer features than the more premium rear-wheel or all-wheel drive variants when they ship later this year. They don’t even have Autopilot, the company’s basic advanced driver assistance system. (The new models only come with traffic-aware cruise control; Autosteer, which completes the “Autopilot” feature-set, is missing.) The release of the cheaper models is supposed to help push Tesla back into growth after it saw sales decline in 2024. But the pricing is not as low as some may have hoped, especially considering that CEO Elon Musk once teased the idea of a $25,000 Tesla — before he ultimately killed that project. The new Model 3 does not even dip below the $35,000 price threshold that Tesla promoted in a run-up to the car’s launch in 2016. That sticker price, which helped put Tesla on the map, was never really offered save for a few months as an off-menu ordering option. The new cars are more different on the inside than the outside. While Tesla’s cars are known for being minimalist, the Model 3 and Model Y Standard take the spartan approach to the limit. There’s no second-row touchscreen. The steering wheel and side mirrors are manually adjusted. There’s no FM/AM radio and just seven speakers compared to the 15 speakers and one subwoofer on the costlier versions. Only the first row has heated seats. On the outside, Tesla ditched the light bar that adorns the nose of the more expensive Model Y variants. The glass roof is also gone on the Standard cars. Musk and other Tesla executives have joked in the past, and at length, about playing “Game of Thrones but [for] pennies” — an effort to describe the company’s mad scramble to remove as much cost out of its cars as possible. That strip-it-down thinking appears to be the primary strategy of how the company approached the Model 3 and Model Y Standard. Tesla plans to sell these versions in multiple global markets, including Europe. The expiration of the U.S. federal EV tax credit last month means these prices will be pretty straightforward in the United States, unless buyers live somewhere with strong state EV incentives. That sets up an interesting calculus for new EV buyers. Major automakers are simultaneously pulling back plans for a number of more expensive electric vehicles, theoretically reducing competition, which could be a boon for Tesla. Ford is working on a low-cost electric vehicle platform due out in 2027. General Motors is bringing back the Chevy Bolt. Upstart automakers like Rivian and Lucid Motors, and even newer entrants like Slate Auto, are pushing to release EVs in the next few years that are priced on either side of the Model 3 and Model Y Standard. Musk did tangible damage to Tesla’s brand earlier this year when he got involved in the second Trump administration. Tesla rebounded to notch its best quarter ever as the EV tax credit expired and it is unclear how durable that momentum will be. The new Standard models will likely apply competitive pressure on Tesla’s own offerings, not to mention the potential havoc it could wreak on the used market.

    "content": "Nuro doesn’t have a typical Silicon Valley origin story. It didn’t emerge after a long, slow slog from a suburban garage or through a flash of insight in a university laboratory. Nor was it founded at the behest of an eccentric billionaire with money to burn. Nuro was born — and ramped up quickly — thanks to a cash windfall from what is now one of its biggest rivals. In the spring of 2016, Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu were teammates on Google’s self-driving car effort. Ferguson was directing the project’s computer vision, machine learning and behavior prediction teams, while Zhu (widely JZ) was in charge of the car’s perception technologies and cutting-edge simulators. “We both were leading pretty large teams and were responsible for a pretty large portion of the Google car’s software system,” Zhu recalls. As Google prepared to spin out its autonomous car tech into the company that would become Waymo, it first needed to settle a bonus program devised in the earliest days of its so-called Chauffeur project. Under the scheme, early team members could choose staggered payouts over a period of eight years — or leave Google and get a lump sum all at once. Ferguson and Zhu would not confirm the amount they received, but court filings released as part of Waymo’s trade secrets case against Uber suggest they each received payouts in the neighborhood of $40 million by choosing to leave. “What we were fortunate enough to receive as part of the self-driving car project enabled us to take riskier opportunities, to go and try to build something that had a significant chance of not working out at all,” Ferguson says. Within weeks of their departure, the two had incorporated Nuro Inc, a company with the non-ironic mission to “better everyday life through robotics.” Its first product aimed to take a unique approach to self-driving cars: Road vehicles with all of the technical sophistication and software smarts of Google’s robotaxis, but none of the passengers. In the five years since, Nuro’s home delivery robots have proven themselves smart, safe and nimble, outpacing Google’s vehicles to secure the first commercial deployment permit for autonomous vehicles in California, as well as groundbreaking concessions from the U.S. government. While robotaxi companies struggle with technical hitches and regulatory red tape, Nuro has already made thousands of robotic pizza and grocery deliveries across the U.S., and Ferguson (as president) and Zhu (as CEO) are now heading a company that as of its last funding round in November 2020 valued it at $5 billion with more than 1,000 employees. But how did they get there so fast, and where are they headed next? “Neither JZ nor I think of ourselves as classic entrepreneurs or that starting a company is something we had to do in our lives,” Ferguson says. “It was much more the result of soul searching and trying to figure out what is the biggest possible impact that we could have.” Ferguson’s original plan, in his home country of New Zealand, was to become a lawyer. While studying at the University of Otago, he took computer science and math courses where he worked on the perception and controls systems for a trashcan robot. He became “totally hooked” and moved to Carnegie Mellon University for a doctorate in robotics. There, Ferguson was involved in the DARPA Urban Challenge, a 60-mile obstacle course on city streets for autonomous vehicles in 2007. CMU’s entry, a heavily modified Chevy Tahoe called Boss, ultimately won first place and a $2 million prize. The victory, however, came at a price: Ferguson was so burned out, he ended up taking a job as a machine learning quant at a hedge fund to de-stress: “It was a huge moment for me and for the industry, but I felt I needed a break.” Meanwhile, Zhu had moved from his native China to study for a master’s at the University of Virginia. His first job out of college in 2008 was working on computer vision problems for Google’s Street View team, where he met Anthony Levandowski and Sebastian Thrun. “Six or seven months in, Sebastian comes to me and said, ‘Hey, we have this secret robotics project. Would you like to be part of it?” Zhu says. “Of course, I said yes. Building intelligent machines with Sebastian and getting paid is the best job in the world.” A couple of years later, Ferguson was tempted back into the self-driving world by some of his CMU colleagues and found himself seated besides Zhu. “And we’ve been sitting next to each other for the last 10 years,” Ferguson laughs. Google’s self-driving car team swelled from just a few engineers in 2009 to dozens and then hundreds within a few years. By the time they had to make their Chauffeur bonus decision in 2016, the duo felt ready for a new challenge. “Waymo had this very clear focus on transportation, but I felt it was good timing to start a robotics company that focuses beyond that,” Zhu says. “If you think about how we interact with the physical world, we spend a ton of time cooking, doing laundry and cleaning just like our parents and grandparents did. At Nuro, we want to change how people spend their time.” Ferguson and Zhu moved into an Airbnb behind the train station in Mountain View, a few miles from Google’s campus. “No one would rent corporate real estate to us because we were an unknown entity,” remembers Cosimo Leipold, an early employee and now Nuro’s head of Partnerships. “So the first thing we would have new employees do is remove a bed from one of the rooms and put together their own desk.” Nuro was a robotics company from day one, according to Ferguson. The crux: Picking the right bot to build. “It’s not about self-driving. It’s not about delivery. It’s about broader robotics. The question is: What is the most useful robot we can build that could really help people in their day-to-day life?” says Ferguson. Unusually for Silicon Valley, the team Ferguson and Zhu put together to answer that question was evenly split between engineers and non-engineers. Their best answer, with existing technologies, was a delivery autonomous vehicle (AV). Research commissioned by Nuro estimates that electric delivery AVs could replace about a quarter of all vehicular shopping and errands trips by 2035. This in turn could avoid over 350,000 injuries and deaths, reduce CO2 emissions equivalent to taking 88 million cars off the roads, save 21 billion hours of driving time and generate over $4 trillion in overall economic benefits. While the first grocery deliveries using Nuro cost customers $6, the company hopes the efficiency of robotic delivery will ultimately eliminate any additional cost altogether. Ferguson and Zhu realized that instead of redesigning the passenger car to operate without a driver, AV makers should be redesigning the driving process so that people don’t need to make a journey in the first place. It’s an insight that seems obvious after a year’s worth of pandemic lockdowns, but Nuro remains one of the very few companies focused on zero-occupancy autonomous vehicles (ZOAVs). “One of the fundamental reasons why passenger self-driving is so difficult is that you’re constantly trying to balance safety and comfort,” Ferguson says. “The bar is very high to keep passengers comfortable, whereas if you’re driving a bottle of milk or a burrito, you can focus entirely on safety.” Nuro’s vehicles are routinely programmed to take the safest routes, even if it means a longer or slower journey. Its latest vehicle, the R2, has a collapsible front end and airbags. Nuro also received a patent in early 2021 for a rapid-stopping technology that allows a vehicle to stop 15 times faster than a typical passenger car. That technology is not deployed in the R2. “This is one of my favorite inventions,” Ferguson says. “It basically fires bolts into the road below to decelerate from 25 miles per hour to a stop in just a few feet. That would be incredibly uncomfortable for a person, but all we’re hurting are some eggs.” However, the development process did have its victims, remembers Leipold. “Our very first activity as a team was building a bright neon green cart with a particleboard front glued on and loaded up with sandbags. We would take turns pushing the cart as fast as we could at someone standing in front to see how much it would hurt,” he says. The final vehicle is about 9 feet long, shorter and narrower than a subcompact vehicle, further reducing sideswipe risks, and limited to a top speed of 25 mph. There are two customizable cargo compartments, together offering more cargo capacity than a Tesla Model 3. Like Google’s self-driving cars, it is also home to a full suite of sensors, including 360-degree laser-ranging lidars, radars and several video cameras. While the R2 can drive itself competently within a well-mapped area, a human “guardian operator” in a nearby operations center monitors its performance and can take control at any time. “We’re confident that this is going to be the next major leap forward in on-road safety, in even a more dramatic sense than [the benefit] we got from seat belts and air bags,” Ferguson says. Nuro’s vision struck a chord with investors. Just a few months after its launch, Nuro raised its first Series A from NetEase founder Ding Lei (aka William Ding) in China. Ding was China’s first internet and gaming billionaire, and was reportedly once the wealthiest person in China. A second, U.S.-based round led by Greylock Partners in June 2017 raised Nuro’s total Series A funding to $92 million. Greylock had been interested in AVs for some time, but took a fairly skeptical view of the technology. “We thought optimism for AVs changing the world was off the charts,” says John Lilly, venture partner at Greylock Capital and now a Nuro board member. “But on almost every call we had with anybody who knew anything, they said we should definitely talk to JZ and Dave. They won’t tell you what they’re doing, we were warned, but they’re awesome.” It took a sustained effort to get into Nuro’s Airbnb digs, and even then Ferguson and Zhu only pulled back the curtain “a little bit,” remembers Lilly. But Greylock was convinced by the little they did see. “The approach of having no people in the car was a highly differentiated point of view, and it’s not what anybody else was doing at the time,” he says. “We were blown away by the progress they had made in just over a year on their own. They looked like a fully formed technology company.” Nuro was also growing like one. In early 2018, Nancy Sun, Jur van den Berg, and Alden Woodrow joined Nuro from the wreckage of Uber’s self-driving truck project. While they were officially Nuro employees, their intent was to license the company’s technology and apply it to highway trucks. “We [were] always looking for opportunities where the tech that we’ve built could help,” Ferguson told TechCrunch in 2019. “Trucking was a really good example, but we recognized that as a company, we couldn’t spread ourselves too thin. It made sense for both sides for [Nancy, Jur and Alden] to build their own independent company.” Four months later, the trio left Nuro to found Ike, taking with them a license to use Nuro’s hardware designs and autonomous software, as well as data logging, maps and simulation systems, in exchange for a minority stake in the new startup. But it was SoftBank’s shockingly large $940 million Series B investment in early 2019 that really put Nuro on the map. “We spent some time with Masa[yoshi Son, SoftBank CEO] who had this really amazing way of describing the future,” Zhu recalls. “He said to us that the future is a big vending machine where people can just say what they want and things will automatically get delivered to them. And he sees Nuro as a very important part of that future. That vision alignment was just what we were looking for.” SoftBank also has so many relationships with many different companies around delivery and transportation that there will be lots of ways for the organizations to work together, Lilly noted. Nuro’s fundraising strategy then evolved to support the founders’ grander ambitions. “The self-driving industry is very capital intensive, so having enough money is a very important way of de-risking the company,” Ferguson says. The investors in the company’s next round, a $500 million Series C in November 2020, reflects that change. The round, which pushed Nuro’s valuation to $5 billion, was led by T. Rowe Price Associates and saw participation from Fidelity Management & Research Company, Baillie Gifford, Chipotle and Toyota’s innovation-focused subsidiary, Woven Planet. “We saw our Series C as a great opportunity to raise a strong round in terms of the total amount, but, perhaps more importantly, to start developing relationships with investors that could be part of our journey for now, forever,” Ferguson says. “T. Rowe and Fidelity are investors that will invest through an IPO and beyond.” Just as important for Nuro has been its commercial partnerships, where Nuro has had pilot delivery projects with retailer Fry’s Food, a subsidiary of its grocery store chain partner Kroger, CVS pharmacies, Domino’s, FedEx and investor/partner Chipotle. At first this involved modified autonomous Prius cars with safety drivers, but Nuro recently started deliveries using the driverless R2. Like Waymo’s autonomous ride-hailing service in Phoenix, Nuro intends to focus on providing autonomy as a service rather than selling its vehicles for the foreseeable future. “If you think about the complexity of the tech we’re building, it would be difficult to hand that off in the early years,” Ferguson says. “Long term, I think there’s more flexibility. You can imagine partners doing maintenance, servicing and maybe housing the bots.” While there are dozens of companies building passenger AVs, Nuro now finds itself in the odd position of having almost no competitors dedicated to on-road ZOAV delivery in the United States. Refraction AI just started pizza deliveries in Austin, Texas, using a robotic electric tricycle that weighs 10 times less than the R2 and travels in bike lanes or on road shoulders at under 15 mph. Refraction’s REV-1 bot has some autonomy on board but relies heavily on teleoperators to ensure it behaves well on the move. “There’s definitely some daylight between the companies,” says Refraction CEO Luke Schneider. “Nuro is developing first-rate perception, AI and autonomous technology. We have a view that’s almost on the other end of the spectrum. We’re trying to build the de facto standard for last-mile delivery: Practical, affordable and sustainable.” There is also nascent competition from the very well-funded legacy AV companies — both Waymo and Cruise have launched delivery projects and pilots. But neither worries Ferguson and Zhu too much. “For almost all of the large self-driving companies, making sure that they are in the hunt for the passenger market is an existential threat,” Ferguson says. “We have an advantage by being able to laser focus on delivery, whereas for other self-driving companies, goods is just one of several applications that they may or may not want to take on in the future.” Even when they do turn their attention to delivery, Nuro thinks it has a head start in relations with retailers, investors, and especially regulators, who have looked favorably on the company’s requests for operations and hardware exemptions, like removing unnecessary wing mirrors and windshields from their vehicles. “Right now, everyone is racing to build a product. If you look a decade out, I don’t think there will be 10 companies competing, because it’s too hard to build this product,” Zhu says. “But if there are three or four companies sharing a trillion-dollar opportunity, that’s a pretty good place to be.” That consolidation has already started, close to home. In December of last year, Ike returned to the Nuro fold, bringing with its 55 employees and nascent relationships with trucking companies like DHL, Ryder and NFI. “What is particularly compelling for Nuro is … there’s a shared DNA,” Ferguson told TechCrunch at the time of the acquisition. “The tech that they built is also something that we can very readily transfer over and almost plug and play into our system.” Unlike much of the tech ecosystem, which provides products and services for corporates and rich consumers, Nuro wants to stay focused on delivering value from the bottom up. Its grocery delivery pilot in Houston started in a majority Black and historically underresourced area, and the company plans to eventually drive the cost of its delivery services down to zero. “We’ve never been interested in building really cool gadgets or toys for the very well-off,” Ferguson says. “It’s always been about the path that we could take as individuals and as a company toward trying to do something big and meaningful in the world.” “Dave and JZ are just spectacular as thinkers and technologists and product people and leaders,” says Lilly. “Building a company from scratch with its own software stack, its own hardware stack and its own service is almost impossible. But if you can do it, then you have control and an ability to deliver a product that’s superior across the experience. It requires exceptional operating talent and a bunch of capital coming together, and that’s what I think we have here.” Of course, the company still has to generate excitement and raise the funds to build tens of thousands — or more — bots. Nuro has a mission of “constant growth,” both geographically, expanding from its small-scale pilots in California, Arizona and Texas, as well as technologically, with new vehicles and systems on its roadmap. New partnerships are set to be announced this year, and the company is engaging with state and federal governments to craft sensible, scalable regulation. One such expansion appears to be taking shape in Nevada, according to public records. Those plans include a dedicated off-road testing center, allowing the company to see how its bots deal with edge cases, such as kid’s soccer balls rolling into the road or monster potholes. Previously unreported testimony to Nevada officials reveals that the state could also become home to a new teleoperations facility, as well as Nuro’s first bot assembly plant. “In the five years since we started the company, sticking to grand missions that sound very altruistic is difficult, because there’s a lot more skepticism around what are you really doing it for?” Ferguson says. “But we really believe that in the next 10 to 15 years, we’re going to see a huge wave of innovation, where generation-defining iconic companies will be created in the robotic space. That’s what we want Nuro to be.” That wave of technological innovation, however, won’t go far if governments don’t look inward and revamp regulations to let companies like Nuro develop new products and services. But Nuro has that part of the challenge more or less in the bag, as we’ll see in part two of this EC-1.

    "content": "As the global appetite for orbital launches continues to grow, the competition among new and old space companies to build bigger and better launch vehicles is firing up. It can be hard to keep up with this fast-paced yet incredibly complex and highly regulated industry — but everything you need to stay up to date is right here, with links to deeper coverage. As a bit of background, it likely won’t surprise you to hear that SpaceX is the undisputed leader in launch, conducting a record 96 launches last year alone. But its supremacy has not cowed a growing number of competitors, who say they can bring much-needed supply and competitive pressure to the market, something that benefits the industry at large. We’ve surveyed the current medium-, heavy- and super-heavy lift rocket landscape, from vehicles that are currently operational to those rockets yet to fly. We decided to exclude smaller launchers in development — like Stoke Space’s Nova and ABL Space’s RS1 — but even so, this is a fairly broad view. Some of the rockets we discuss below may not compete directly with each other and will vary widely in price. But any one of them coming online would likely mean a shake-up to their vehicle class: Relativity’s Terran R could destabilize Falcon 9’s dominance; New Glenn and Starship could unlock regular travel to the moon and beyond. If even one succeeds, which is all but a certainty, it will change everything. Before we begin, some definitions: medium-lift generally means a payload capacity of 2,000-20,000 kilograms (4,400-44,000 pounds) to low Earth orbit; heavy-lift, 20,000-50,000 kilograms (44,000 pounds-110,000 pounds); and super-heavy, which can haul over 50,000 kilograms. Here are the ones currently flying: And those yet to achieve orbit: Newcomers will be facing stiff competition from the get-go, especially in the heavy-lift category. So far this year, we’ve already seen the debut of ULA’s Vulcan Centaur and Arianespace’s Ariane 6, and there could be even more before the year is out. Vulcan Centaur is arguably United Launch Alliance’s most competitive rocket to date. Cheaper than its predecessor Atlas and Delta IV Heavy predecessors, Vulcan can also be configured in different ways to accommodate different mission profiles. But there are still questions on whether ULA, a Lockheed-Boeing joint venture, will be able to compete on price in the long-term. Vulcan has some interesting architecture going for it: It can be configured in four standard ways, to accommodate a massive range of payloads to orbits ranging from geosynchronous to low Earth orbit. The rocket took off for the first time in January 2024 after several delays, in part due to issues with their BE-4 rocket engine supplier, Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin. ULA has one more launch to go before it receives its certification from the U.S. Department of Defense. At that point, the company can start fulfilling a 26-launch backlog for the Space Force. That second certification launch is scheduled for around September. Europe is pinning its launch hopes on Ariane 6, which, although much delayed, finally made its inaugural flight earlier this summer. European officials are hoping that the new heavy-lift rocket will fill the wide launch capability gap on the continent, which has seen some of its critical missions go to SpaceX, for lack of a native launch provider. The rocket was developed by ArianeGroup, a joint venture between Safran and Airbus, and overseen by the primary contractor the European Space Agency. Ariane 6’s first flight didn’t go entirely to plan — there was an anomaly with the upper stage’s engine on orbit which meant the final two onboard payloads were not deployed — but ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher confirmed that the agency was going to push ahead with a second flight by the end of the year. NASA’s Space Launch System is really, really big, and really, really expensive. The towering, 321-foot-tall rocket has cost $23.8 billion from its inception in 2011 through to its first flight at the end of 2022, The Planetary Society estimated. Those costs will continue to mount: After its maiden launch in November 2022, NASA aims to launch SLS a second time next year. But because the rocket is fully expendable, every component has been built from scratch. SLS’s long-term future remains unclear, especially given the rise of reusability, and use cases are basically non-existent beyond its launches for NASA’s Artemis program. Falcon Heavy has flown a total of 10 times since its maiden launch in 2018. That launch captured a lot of attention, mostly because SpaceX CEO Elon Musk decided the payload should be a red Tesla roadster (complete with a dummy astronaut in the driver’s seat). If the rocket looks similar to Falcon 9, that’s because it’s essentially the same rocket with two additional first-stage boosters strapped to the bottom. The rocket has been used to launch heavy satellites to geostationary orbits, large classified payloads for the DOD and scientific instruments like the Psyche asteroid orbiter. Falcon Heavy’s major advantage is power: It’s essentially a Falcon 9 but with three core boosters strapped together. That means triple the number of engines — and triple the thrust. The rocket race is far from decided. Take a look at the next generation of launch vehicles that will make their debut over the next few years. Starship is undoubtedly the most well-known rocket in the cohort, thanks in part to the company’s fast development cycle and relentlessly publicized launch test campaign — which has made enormous progress since the first orbital test launch in April 2023. Each launch has gone progressively farther than the one before, and the fourth saw the 400-foot-tall vehicle embark on a suborbital trajectory with both the booster and the first stage splashing down in the ocean. For the fifth flight, which could happen as soon as late August or early September, it appears that SpaceX is aiming to return the booster to the South Texas launch site and catching it with massive “chopstick” arms on the massive Mechazilla launch tower. Much is riding on Starship’s success: NASA wants to use the rocket to return humans to the moon, as part of its Artemis campaign, and has paid billions to assist with the rocket development. It would also bring the company one step further to CEO Elon Musk’s ultimate vision: “expanding the light of consciousness” through the solar system, starting with a colony on Mars. One of the most hotly anticipated launch vehicle debuts coming up is Blue Origin’s New Glenn, a 322-foot tall rocket that would be the company’s first orbital rocket if next month’s launch goes to plan. (New Shepard, its operational space tourism rocket, only flies to suborbital altitudes.) While SpaceX and Blue Origin have much in common — apart from being backed by billionaire founders — SpaceX has vastly outpaced Blue in nearly every category. According to recent reporting, Blue’s new CEO, former Amazon exec David Limp, is looking to seriously change that. That change arguably begins with New Glenn, so there’s a lot riding on this first launch — not least because it will be carrying two Rocket Lab-made spacecraft to the red planet under a massive NASA contract. Once it’s operational, the rocket will have around the same payload capacity as SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, which means it will be a serious competitor for critical national security and government missions. No doubt Blue will also be throwing its hat in the ring for large lunar landers, space station modules and other tech. Relativity Space first gained notoriety in 2015 when it emerged with an ambitious goal to build rockets faster and more cheaply by leveraging 3D-printing technology. The company’s small rocket Terran 1 was 85% 3D-printed by mass. That rocket was meant to be Relativity’s first to go to market, but after a single launch that failed to reach orbit in March 2023, the company decided to make a hard pivot and retire that rocket entirely. Instead, it’s gone all-in on the larger Terran R. The 270-foot-tall rocket will be launching from Launch Complex 16 at Florida’s Cape Canaveral Space Force Base starting in 2026. The company has reportedly signed over $1.8 billion across nine customer contracts for the rocket. Neutron is Rocket Lab’s highly anticipated second rocket, joining the company’s successful small Electron rocket. But while the lightweight Electron is designed for fast turnaround times and bespoke orbits, Neutron is designed to compete with Falcon 9 — and to serve customers like the U.S. Department of Defense and companies developing mega-constellations. Rocket Lab is currently working on pad construction at NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia; meanwhile, engineers at NASA’s Stennis Space Center are preparing to hot fire the rocket’s new engine, called Archimedes, for the first time. Rocket Lab executives recently confirmed that the rocket won’t make its debut until 2025, after insisting for quite a while that the rocket would be on the pad before year-end. “Getting Neutron to the pad this year was an ambitious green-light schedule that we had a path to closing if every single aspect went exactly according to plan,” CEO Peter Beck said in an earnings call. “But as we’ve always said, this is a rocket development program and this is always filled with gremlins, some in our control and some not.” Firefly and Northrop’s medium-launch vehicle is designed to combine the best of a startup’s agility with the flight heritage of Northrop’s Antares launch vehicle. According to Firefly, the MLV will combine many of the flight-proven systems from Antares with tech from Firefly’s small Alpha rocket, plus some upgrades, like a larger fairing and a more powerful second stage. The two companies haven’t revealed much else about the mysterious rocket, but we know that it will be launching from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at Wallops Island, Virginia. The rocket is expected to make its debut later in 2025. Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "content": "SpaceX has successfully launched its Iridium-5 mission, which carries 10 satellites to add to Iridium’s NEXT global communications constellation. This is the fifth set of 10, out of a total of 75 that SpaceX is launching for client Iridium, and today’s launch used a first stage Falcon 9 booster originally employed last October for the third Iridium NEXT satellite launch. The launch included reuse of a flight proven rocket, but it did not include a recovery attempt for the first stage booster this time around. SpaceX attempted to recover one half of the fairing used during the launch, which is the protective metal shielding that covers the cargo as the rocket blasts through the atmosphere en route to space. The fairing alone is worth around $6 million, and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has indicated that it would be relatively easy to refurbish this part for repeat flight, provided their recovery plan works. SpaceX was once again unsuccessful in recovering the fairing, per Musk. The parafoil that controls the fairing’s descent twisted during its return to Earth, and so the component crashed into the water a high velocity instead of alighting softly on the barge as intended. Meanwhile, the 10 satellites were deployed as planned to their target low-Earth orbit, and will join the NEXT constellation, providing commercial communications capabilities to Iridium clients on the ground. This is SpaceX’s fifth Falcon 9 launch of 2018, and its sixth launch of the year overall when you include the Falcon Heavy launch which took place in February. That was a significant milestone for the company, and additional Falcon Heavy launches are planned for later this year, as well as another Falcon 9 launch on April 2: The twelfth commercial resupply mission SpaceX will fly for the International Space Station.

    "content": "Falcon Heavy, the high-capacity rocket created by SpaceX designed for bringing very large loads to orbit and beyond, will get its first launch this coming November, according to SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk. Musk shared the news on Instagram on Thursday, posting an image of a concept depiction of the rocket’s launch alongside the target date. The Falcon Heavy uses the combined power of one Falcon 9 rocket flanked by two additional Falcon 9 boosters to propel up to around 30 tons to geostationary transfer orbit. Falcon Heavy maiden launch this November https://t.co/D4Dxq9d6hc — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 28, 2017 SpaceX had shared video of a static test fire of the Falcon Heavy core at its Texas facility earlier this year, and is working on targeting payload launches next year, with a first commercial launch planned for later in 2018. This first test launch could have some very interesting results – Elon Musk himself set expectations during remarks made at this year’s International Space Station Research & Development conference earlier this month. Musk noted that it was unlikely the first launch would see the Falcon Heavy reach orbit, and in fact, he said he’d be happy if it didn’t result in any damage to the launch facility. Falcon Heavy is a big part of Musk’s plan to further commercialize Earth orbit, and also to prepare for eventual crewed missions to Mars.

    "content": "SpaceX successfully launched a Falcon 9 first-stage that had previously served two missions in July and November of 2018, today carrying its final payload, the AMOS-17 satellite for Spacecom. SpaceX had configured the Falcon 9 in its “expendable mode” for this mission, which means it made use of all available fuel on board to carry the 14,000+ lb satellite to orbit, without enough left over to come back in a controlled descent and landing. A service life of three full missions is nothing to sneeze at, however, and definitely helps SpaceX save some costs on each of the missions flown by this flight-proven rocket booster. Meanwhile, everything looks to have gone to plan in terms of the AMOS-17 mission parameters, too. The multi-purpose geostationary communications satellite, which will provide mobile, streaming and video connectivity across parts of the Middle East, Africa and Europe, reached geostationary transfer orbit and then reached its target orbit and deployed as planned. SpaceX also recovered at least the fairing used to protect the cargo as it ascends to space tonight — it managed to catch one half in a giant net strung across support structures on “Ms. Tree,” a ship operated by SpaceX specifically for this purpose. The other half fell into the ocean, and SpaceX will try to collect that half as well, using a second ship it has for that purpose. SpaceX has recovered a fairing half using the net mounted on ‘Ms. Tree’ previously – it caught a fairing used in its last Falcon Heavy launch in June.

It’s the most rockets SpaceX has launched in a single year, beating its previous best by ten missions. The launch today was for client Iridium, delivering 10 satellites to low Earth orbit for its Iridium NEXT communications constellation. This is the fourth such mission that SpaceX has flown for the company, and the rocket used for this mission was a flight proven Falcon 9 that previously flew in June for the second Iridium mission. Iridium was also the client for SpaceX’s first mission of 2017 back in January – its first flight following a pre-launch accident last September that cost it its rocket and the payload, a Facebook internet satellite. SpaceX launched its rocket from its launch complex at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, and the mission parameters didn’t include attempting a rocket recovery of the first stage. The first stage underwent a landing sequence as it does when a recovery is attempted, but there was no drone landing ship in the Pacific Ocean to catch it when it touched down. The launch resulted in some amazing visuals for residents of L.A. and the surrounding area, many of whom took to Twitter to share footage and pictures: UFO in LA? I’m scared pic.twitter.com/Q1BFnzgLir — ellis 🍔 (@hamburger) December 23, 2017 Iridium’s goal with its NEXT satellite constellation is to provide 100 percent coverage of the globe for tracking all flights in progress in real-time, and it will also be able to monitor every single ship traversing Earth via the same technology, making that info available for its commercial customers. The next big milestone for SpaceX is coming up quickly: The company is hoping to launch its very first Falcon Heavy rocket in January, 2018. The rocket, which has a tremendous heavy load capacity, is already undergoing preparations for launch at Florida’s Cape Canaveral Air Force base – preparations which include loading its payload, an original cherry red Tesla Roadster.

    "content": "Today brings historic firsts for both SpaceX and Bangladesh: the former is sending up the final, highly updated revision of its Falcon 9 rocket for the first time, and the latter is launching its first satellite. It’s a preview of the democratized space economy to come this century. Update: Success! The Falcon 9 first stage, after delivering the second stage to the border of space, has successfully landed on the drone ship Of Course I Still Love You, and Bangabandhu has been delivered to its target orbit. You can watch the launch below: Although Bangabandhu-1 is definitely important, especially to the nation launching it, it is not necessarily in itself a highly notable satellite. It’s to be a geostationary communications hub that serves the whole country and region with standard C-band and Ku-band connectivity for all kinds of purposes. Currently the country spends some $14 million per year renting satellite time from other countries, something they determined to stop doing as a matter of national pride and independence. “A sovereign country, in a pursuit of sustainable development, needs its own satellite in order to reduce its dependency on other nations,” reads the project description at the country’s Telecommunications Regulation Commission, which has been pursuing the idea for nearly a decade. It contracted with Thales Alenia Space to produce and test the satellite, which cost about $250 million and is expected to last at least 15 years. In addition to letting the country avoid paying satellite rent, it could generate revenue by selling its services to private companies and nearby nations. “This satellite, which carries the symbolic name of the father of the nation, Bangabandhu, is a major step forward for telecommunications in Bangladesh, and a fantastic driver of economic development and heightened recognition across Asia,” said the company’s CEO, Jean-Loïc Galle, in a recent blog post about the project. Bangabandhu-1 will be launching atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, but this one is different from all the others that have flown in the past. Designed with crewed missions in mind, it could be thought of as the production version of the rocket, endowed with all the refinements of years of real-world tests. Most often referred to as Block 5, this is (supposedly) the final revision of the Falcon 9 hardware, safer and more reusable than previous versions. The goal is for a Block 5 first stage to launch a hundred times before being retired, far more than the handful of times existing Falcon 9s have been reused. There are lots of improvements over the previous rockets, though many are small or highly technical in nature. The most important, however, are easy to enumerate. The engines themselves have been improved and strengthened to allow not only greater thrust (reportedly about a 7-8 percent improvement) but improved control and efficiency, especially during landing. They also have a new dedicated heat shield for descent. They’re rated to fly 10 times without being substantially refurbished, but are also bolted on rather than welded, further reducing turnaround time. The legs on which the rocket lands are also fully retractable, meaning they don’t have to be removed before transport. If you want to launch the same rocket within days, every minute counts. Instead of white paint, the first stage will have a thermal coating (also white) that helps keep it relatively cool during descent. To further reduce heat damage, the rocket’s “grid fins,” the waffle-iron-like flaps that pop out to control its descent, are now made of a single piece of titanium. They won’t catch fire or melt during reentry like the previous aluminum ones sometimes did, and as such are now permanently attached features of the rocket. (SpaceX founder Elon Musk is particularly proud of these fins, which flew on the Falcon Heavy side boosters; in the briefing afterwards, he said: “I’m actually glad we got the side boosters back, because they had the titanium fins. If I had to pick something to get back, it’d be those.”) Lastly (for our purposes anyway) the fuel tank has been reinforced out of concerns some had about the loading of supercooled fuel while the payload — soon to be humans, if all goes well — is attached to the rocket. This system failed before, causing a catastrophic explosion in 2016, but the fault has been addressed and the reinforcement should help further mitigate risk. (The emergency abort rockets should also keep astronauts safe should something go wrong during launch.) The changes, though they contribute directly to reuse and cost reductions, are also aimed at satisfying the requirements of NASA’s commercial crew missions. SpaceX is in competition to provide both launch and crew capsule services for missions to the ISS, scheduled for as early as late 2018. The company needs to launch the Block 5 version of Falcon 9 (not necessarily the same exact rocket) at least 7 times before any astronauts can climb aboard.

    "content": "In 2022, uncertainty continued: Major acquisitions took place, layoffs swept the tech industry and Elon Musk bought Twitter. While that last one may not have been on your 2022 bingo card, it certainly caused quite a bit of commotion here at TechCrunch — and got us talking. This year, a big trend for us was doing “three views” and other collaboration pieces. It’s a fun way for us to work with our colleagues while offering differing opinions about trending topics in the tech space. Here are some of our favorites: Earlier this year, Amazon acquired One Medical for $3.9 billion, yes that’s billion with a B. We gathered some TechCrunch+ staff to get their thoughts on the purchase. Alex Wilhelm was skeptical because, frankly, he doesn’t want Amazon as his health provider. Miranda Halpern (me, hello, hi) felt that this acquisition followed a logical progression for Amazon since it entered the healthcare space in 2018. Walter Thompson saw this as a chance for Amazon to accrete additional mass. VMware was freed from Dell in April 2022, and Alex and Ron Miller wrote about who they think may buy it. In May, the Broadcom-VMware deal was a go, but Alex and Ron found themselves on opposite sides of a hypothetical — would a higher price or another bidder make sense? Alex didn’t feel that VMware deserved a higher price and Ron thought that the company’s value was higher than its financial results at the time. We’ve all heard by now that the reason millennials won’t be able to purchase a home is that they keep buying avocado toast. As a zillenial, I disagree with the avocado toast sentiment, partially because I’m allergic to avocados but mainly because homes are no longer affordable. Adam Neumann’s latest startup, Flow, backed by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), aims to revolutionize the rental industry. Tim De Chant, Dominic-Madori Davis and Amanda Silberling shared their thoughts on whether Flow will make a difference — and whether Neumann even deserved the VC funding at all. In 2022, Alex predicted that open source would become the de facto startup model. Natasha Mascarenhas posited everything would be hybridized. Anna Heim, meantime, suggested a majority of SaaS companies would adopt usage-based pricing. While some of their predictions for 2022 came true, some fell short. In true TechCrunch fashion, they followed up this article by predicting 2023’s key startup themes. We’ll check back in a year to see how well they stood the test of time. Where would you scream into the void if Twitter were to disappear (read: die)? While that may be the question for some people, others would miss it for more important reasons. Dominic would miss the community aspect of Twitter, specifically Black Twitter. “The memes are endless, as is the support — and the heat — we give and place onto people and topics. It was a place to find community in a world so unkind to us. It really does feel like its own universe sometimes,” she wrote. Check out the full article to see what Ron, Amanda, Christine Hall, Paul Sawers, Natasha, Ivan Mehta and Alex worry about losing if Twitter goes belly up.

    "content": "Elon Musk says he has found a new CEO for Twitter. Musk did not specify who will be taking on the role, though The Wall Street Journal is now reporting that NBCUniversal Head of Advertising Linda Yaccarino is “in talks” for the position. In a tweet, Musk announced that he will transition from his role as CEO of the social network to serving as its executive chair and chief technology officer. The new CEO is expected to start in six weeks, according to Musk. “Excited to announce that I’ve a new CEO for X/Twitter,” Musk wrote in the tweet. “She will be starting in ~6 weeks! My role will transition to being exec chair & CTO, overseeing product, software & sysops.” Excited to announce that I’ve a new CEO for X/Twitter. She will be starting in ~6 weeks! My role will transition to being exec chair & CTO, overseeing product, software & sysops. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 11, 2023 Musk purchased the social network last October for $44 billion after initially offering to buy it in April 2022. After the acquisition was complete, Musk took charge as CEO and quickly let go of Twitter’s previous CEO Parag Agrawal and other executive leaders. He then laid off half the social network’s staff in November. Musk previously said he planned to step down as CEO and appoint a new chief executive before the end of 2023, noting that he would honor the results of a poll asking whether he should remain in charge of the company. However, he has previously not named any prospective candidates. In his time as CEO, Musk has significantly overhauled Twitter’s policies and features, which has led to several major advertisers pausing spending on the social network. Musk rolled out a revamped, pricier Twitter Blue subscription that allows users to buy verification and recently got rid of old “legacy” verified check marks. The platform has also disbanded its Trust and Safety council and reinstated the accounts of previously banned users, including former president Donald Trump and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Musk’s decision to appoint a new Twitter CEO will likely appease Tesla investors, who have been concerned that Musk’s time spent on Twitter is taking him away from his position as CEO of Tesla. Following the news that he found a replacement for the role, Tesla shares surged. Although Musk will soon no longer be CEO of Twitter, he still owns the company. Musk recently renamed Twitter Inc. to X Corp. He has long aspired to build what he calls “X, the everything app.” https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/11/elon-musks-twitter-everything-you-need-to-know-from-layoffs-to-verification/?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=WPunit Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "content": "The FCC has made a final denial of Starlink’s application for $885 million in public funds to expand its orbital communications infrastructure to cover parts of rural America, saying the company “failed to demonstrate that it could deliver the promised service.” As previously reported, the money in question was part of the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, a multibillion-dollar program to subsidize the rollout of internet service in places where private companies have previously decided it’s too expensive or distant to do so. The $885 million was first set aside for Starlink in 2020, corresponding to the company’s bid on how much connectivity it could provide, at what cost and to which regions. The FCC explained that this first application was a high-level, short one, and that those qualifying for that would receive closer scrutiny. For instance, one organization assigned over a billion dollars in funds turned out to be a regional operation that couldn’t possibly expand the way it hoped to. In Starlink’s case, it was determined last summer that although the satellite internet proposal had promise, it was a “still developing technology” that required the user to purchase a dish, then priced at $600. Many people won’t pay that much for internet for a year, so it’s a serious consideration given the target demographic of people lacking resources. (In fact the FCC had considered not even letting orbital communications companies apply, but decided to allow them to compete on their merits.) This was in addition to “numerous financial and technical deficiencies” the agency identified in the proposal and the company’s operations. That’s not to say it isn’t a well-run company with a good service for some, but that for the purposes of this auction and award, there were serious questions: After reviewing all of the information submitted by Starlink, the Bureau ultimately concluded that Starlink had not shown that it was reasonably capable of fulfilling RDOF’s requirements to deploy a network of the scope, scale, and size required to serve the 642,925 model locations in 35 states for which it was the winning bidder. Starlink asked that the decision be reviewed, as is their right in this situation, claiming among other things that it had been held to an “inappropriately onerous standard.” It (apparently, for the relevant passages are redacted in the latest order) argued that although short-term testing showed declining speeds and other metrics, the company had a plan to launch more satellites and would be able to grow the network as claimed. It even leaned on the promise of SpaceX’s super-heavy launch vehicle Starship as evidence for these claims. A the time of the Bureau’s decision, Starship had not yet been launched. Indeed, even as of today [i.e. over a year later], Starship has not yet had a successful launch; all of its attempted launches have failed. Based on Starlink’s previous assertions about its plans to launch its second-generation satellites via Starship, and the information that was available at the time, the [Wireline Competition] Bureau necessarily considered Starlink’s continuing inability to successfully launch the Starship rocket when making predictive judgment about its ability to meet its RDOF obligations. In a footnote it is pointed out that it was only after the denial was issued that SpaceX announced it would not be using Starship after all for the second generation of Starlink satellites. SpaceX launches Starship for the second time, going farther than ever before Basically, though they see the merit to the approach, they couldn’t be 100% sure that this was the best use of the better part of a billion dollars. Perhaps in the next fund. The two Republican FCC Commissioners, Brendan Carr and Nathan Simington, dissented from this decision. Simington perhaps rightly points out that “many RDOF recipients deployed no service at any speed to any location at all,” while Starlink was serving half a million subscribers at the time of rejection, many in areas not served by other broadband options. He dismisses the launch problems as quibbles in the Bureau’s “motivated reasoning.” Carr, for his part, calls it politics: “After Elon Musk acquired Twitter and used it to voice his own political and ideological views without a filter, President Biden gave federal agencies a greenlight to go after him…Elon Musk has become ‘Progressive Enemy No. 1.’ Today’s decision certainly fits the Biden administration’s pattern of regulatory harassment.” Of course, the Starlink denial took place well before that acquisition and Elon Musk’s subsequent fall from grace (what of it he had), and the FCC is simply reaffirming the reasoning here today, not issuing it fresh. That’s quite a factual error to lead with. Elon Musk owns Twitter: The story so far Both men evince a faith in Starlink that may or may not be misplaced. With $885 million at stake, however, the FCC’s decision to err, if it did so, on the side of caution makes sense. The funding will go to other applicants and programs. Though this money was never actually given to Starlink, the loss of income (or however such an award would be classed financially) is not easy to bear. That said, it likely knew its appeal of the decision was a long shot and has not been counting on this money for quite a while. And although the company is not making money, it did recently reach “breakeven cash flow,” if its CEO Elon Musk is to be believed. Certainly its revenue has skyrocketed (from around $222 million to $1.4 billion), but that has come at great operating cost as the satellites required to service thousands of new customers are built and launched. It is behind its own predictions from some years back that it would be billions in the black by now, but it has at least demonstrated its capabilities convincingly both domestically and in warfare. Maybe it doesn’t need that $885 million after all — the Pentagon’s money is just as green.

    "content": "Instagram Threads now has more than 130 million monthly active users, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings today. The text-based social networking app is one of the many new projects that have sprung up in the wake of Elon Musk’s 2022 acquisition of Twitter, now called X, where it competes with various startups and open source projects, including Bluesky, Mastodon, Nostr, Post, Spill and others. Zuckerberg said that Threads is “growing steadily,” though characterized the app as having blown up before Meta was ready. “I’ll note that Threads now has more people actively using it today than it did during its initial launch peak,” said Zuckerberg. “So that one’s I think on track to be a major success.” Last quarter, Zuckerberg also spoke highly of Threads, saying he believed the app had a good chance of reaching 1 billion users within a few years. At the time, Threads had north of 100 million monthly active users. Meta said its family of apps, which also includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, were used by 3.19 billion people daily in the fourth quarter, up from the 3.14 billion it saw in the quarter ending September 2023. Monthly active users were at 3.98 billion, up from 3.96 billion in the prior quarter. We’ve seen evidence that Threads has been gaining traction in recent weeks. App intelligence provider Appfigures found that the Instagram-owned app had tripled its downloads in December to become the No. 6 most downloaded app in the month across the Apple App Store and Google Play. X, still struggling with its rebranding, was No. 36. By leveraging Instagram’s friend graph, Threads had a record-breaking launch, reaching 100 million registered users within its first five days last July. But interest in Threads began to taper off in the fall, only returning to growth as Meta gave it a push by promoting Threads’ viral posts to Facebook users. That likely helped the app secure its spot in the top 10 most downloaded apps globally in December. Zuckerberg’s comments were likely meant to head off concerns that had been raised during Threads’ downturn, which had some critics prematurely declaring it dead. That doesn’t appear to be the case any more — and a third-party tracker says Threads has an estimated 160 million total users. As for Meta’s earnings, the company saw $40.1 billion in revenue in the quarter ending in December 2023, ahead of analysts’ estimates of $39.18 billion and earnings of $5.33 per share, ahead of estimates of $4.96. Net income was $14.02 billion. Revenue for the full-year 2023 was $134.90 billion. Meta also announced its first cash dividend of $0.50 per share, which will be paid in March to Meta’s shareholders.

    "content": "Elon Musk has spent decades building a universe of companies that has served as an incubator for up-and-coming engineers and a proving ground for his inner circle. That universe — an ecosystem of Silicon Valley tech titans, veterans of his companies like Tesla and SpaceX, and a crop of fresh-faced hackers and software engineers — has now collided with the U.S. federal government. The dozens of individuals who work under, or advise, Musk and the Trump-ordered Department of Government Efficiency — individuals who TechCrunch has identified or confirmed independently — reflects more than the billionaire’s proclivity to collect talent. They are a real-life illustration of Musk’s web-like reach in the tech industry. TechCrunch set out to report on or confirm the individuals working as Musk representatives in the U.S. government. Importantly, we’ve sought to show the connections between them, and how and when they entered Musk’s orbit. Along the way, TechCrunch has made some new discoveries, including new details about DOGE and its workers and an xAI-powered chatbot on a DOGE-related website subdomain that is hosted on a Musk acolyte’s website. Since publishing, TechCrunch has learned that DOGE cut cybersecurity staff at CISA, and confirmed several more Musk-linked DOGE associates, including a former VC who now works at the Social Security Administration. This article has been updated multiple times since it was published February 18, 2025. TechCrunch interviewed people who have worked with Musk and DOGE staffers. We used public and open source data, such as historical internet records and chat logs, to confirm parts of our reporting. We also relied on services like the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine to access archived copies of websites that are no longer online. Public information, such as court records, payments transactions, other media reports, and past TechCrunch reporting were also used. TechCrunch reached out to all those named for an opportunity to comment. For those whose contact information we did not have, TechCrunch contacted known representatives, including the Trump administration. When reached for comment, a White House spokesperson provided a statement to TechCrunch. (The spokesperson sent the email “on background,” but we are publishing in full as we were given no opportunity to decline the terms.) “DOGE is fulfilling President Trump’s commitment to making government more accountable, efficient, and, most importantly, restoring proper stewardship of the American taxpayer’s hard-earned dollars. Those leading this mission with Elon Musk are doing so in full compliance with federal law, appropriate security clearances, and as employees of the relevant agencies, not as outside advisers or entities. The ongoing operations of DOGE may be seen as disruptive by those entrenched in the federal bureaucracy, who resist change. While change can be uncomfortable, it is necessary and aligns with the mandate supported by more than 77 million American voters,” the statement read. Scroll down to learn about the individuals in the DOGE universe, which have been broken down by type: Musk’s inner circle; senior figures; worker bees; and aides, some of whom are advising and recruiting for DOGE. If you know more about DOGE, contact TechCrunch securely. Role: DOGE Lead, Unpaid “Special Government Employee” Gravitas. Obsession. Ambition. Risk-taker. Elon Musk observers and sycophants have pointed to these traits to explain his rise from a bright-eyed immigrant landing in the United States to one of the world’s richest and most powerful people, and now a right-hand to President Donald Trump. The overlooked secret sauce is Musk’s ability to get talented people to sign on to “the mission.” That there are multiple, overlapping, and evolving missions — saving the planet through sustainable transport and energy, solving traffic, making humanity multiplanetary, or protecting public conversation — doesn’t really matter. The biggest carrot was, and has always been, Musk’s “us versus them” framing, according to five sources who had lengthy stints at Tesla and spoke to TechCrunch on condition of anonymity. In the past, the “them” might be local regulators, the press, or legacy automakers. Today, the people working closely with Musk to complete his next mission via the Department of Government Efficiency have a new “them” to battle: waste and bureaucrats. Musk has talked at length about government agencies that should be “deleted entirely.” Meanwhile, Musk’s companies have benefited from government contracts and incentives. His company SpaceX has been awarded more than $20 billion in contracts from NASA, the Department of Defense, and other federal agencies, according to data from USASpending.gov. Musk is an unpaid special government employee, according to the White House. Per a filing on February 17, the Trump administration said Musk is a White House employee and a senior advisor to the president. According to the Trump administration’s executive order, DOGE is a temporary government organization whose authorities are set to expire in July 2026. In April, Musk made public statements that he was backing away from DOGE to focus on his own companies, namely Tesla. And yet, Musk also said he may keep doing work with the department through the remainder of Trump’s second term. Steve Davis is a long-time Musk confidant. He began working at SpaceX as one of its earliest employees in 2003 after earning a master’s degree in aerospace engineering from Stanford University, according to the Los Angeles Times. By 2016, Musk tapped Davis to run what at the time was his newest far-fetched idea: An underground transit play known as The Boring Company. On his watch, The Boring Company raised hundreds of millions of dollars and built a few short so-called “Tesla tunnels” in Las Vegas. But the company has also ended up dropping its previously announced plans for tunnels in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago, according to The Wall Street Journal. Davis has a reputation as a relentless negotiator, and Musk brought him on board at Twitter to help with the takeover and subsequent slash-and-burn. Davis and his family reportedly slept in a makeshift bedroom at the company’s headquarters during this time. In a 2023 lawsuit against Twitter filed by former employees, the plaintiffs alleged that Davis said to the effect of, “we don’t have to follow those rules,” in response to a request to get permits to install a bathroom for Musk. Davis has served as a member of the board of advisers of the Atlas Society, a group centered around the philosophy of Ayn Rand, per Bloomberg. Davis is now helping Musk slash government headcount, which Rand once called the “worst part” of the “producers’ burden.” Nicole Hollander garnered public attention in the aftermath of Elon Musk’s $44 billion acquisition of Twitter in early 2022. The George Washington University alum and former employee of real estate developer JGB Smith (per her LinkedIn profile) was part of the polarizing Twitter transition team that upended the company and slashed its workforce. As part of that transition, Hollander and Musk ally Steve Davis moved into the company’s headquarters with their infant, according to a civil lawsuit filed in 2023. The lawsuit was filed by several former Twitter employees against X Corp., the Musk entity that took over. The plaintiffs said in the complaint Hollander was not employed by any of Musk’s companies at that time. Hollander’s relationship with Davis — and her current employment at X — has kept her in Musk’s circle. Her role at DOGE doesn’t have an official title, at least one that is public. However, Wired reported in late January that Hollander has high-level access to federal agencies and an official government email address. Hollander is working at the GSA, per Wired, where she oversaw the accidental disclosure of a secret CIA facility, per the publication’s follow-up reporting. Role: Senior Advisor, Office of Personnel Management Brian Bjelde is a true Elon Musk veteran, with 21 years at SpaceX, where he was employee No. 14 and continues to work today. While he started as an avionics engineer, Bjelde has spent the last decade running the company’s human resources department. In a 2014 Reddit “ask me anything,” Bjelde said that at SpaceX, “We try not to limit our thinking except by the limits imposed by physics.” Several former employees sued SpaceX and Musk in 2024 alleging sexual harassment and a hostile work environment. According to the complaint, Bjelde once starred in a video for the space company where a staffer spanked him — an apparent attempt at tongue-in-cheek humor — and he also was involved in the firings of several employees who spoke up about the company’s culture in 2022. Prior to SpaceX, Bjelde spent a year at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory after graduating from the University of Southern California with a master’s degree in astronautical engineering. At DOGE, Bjelde is reportedly a senior advisor at OPM. Role: Chief of Staff, Office of Personnel Management Amanda Scales doesn’t directly work for DOGE, but is now chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management, the federal government’s main human resources department, according to an OPM memo. Scales used to work on talent acquisition at Musk’s company x.AI until January 2025, according to her LinkedIn profile. She also worked in human resources and talent at San Francisco-based VC firm Human Capital, as well as at Uber. Scales graduated from University of California, Davis in 2012 with degrees in psychology and economics, per her LinkedIn. Role: Head of IT at X; Former DOGE Operative Spikes serves as the head of IT at X since February 2025, according to his LinkedIn profile. Prior to that, he said in his X bio that he had “most recently” worked for DOGE. Spikes recently confirmed to journalist Brian Krebs that he worked for DOGE for two months in Washington, D.C. “to help save [the country] from certain bankruptcy.” Spikes is a longtime Musk insider, touting on his LinkedIn profile that he was the fourth hire at SpaceX and was among the first employees at PayPal. Spikes’ ex-wife is married to Musk’s cousin, Krebs reported. Role: Long-time Musk assistantJehn Balajadia first joined the Musk ecosystem in 2017, according to her LinkedIn profile, which lists her title as operations coordinator at The Boring Company. But LinkedIn records don’t always reflect actual positions — and their evolution — in Musk’s world. In 2018, Balajadia took over the executive assistant to the office of CEO position, a role that included managing all of Musk’s activities and often those of his family members, according to interactions between a TechCrunch reporter and SpaceX and Musk employees at the time. Today, Balajadia has a role within DOGE. According to The New York Times, she is listed in the employee directory of the Education Department. The book “Breaking Twitter” claims Balajadia once told another Musk official that her job was to “take care” of him, and she reportedly often travels with Musk. When Musk took over Twitter, Balajadia was named chief of staff, and she was the one who delivered letters of dismissal to several Twitter executives, per Walter Isaacson’s book on Elon Musk. Prior to joining Tesla, Balajadia worked at Red Bull, NBCUniversal, and Walt Disney. Role: Senior Advisor to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management Riccardo Biasini entered into Musk’s orbit in 2011 when he joined Tesla as an engineer after completing his master’s degree in automotive engineering from the University of Pisa, Italy the previous year. During his five years at Tesla, Biasini focused much of his attention on Autopilot, the company’s branded advanced driver assistance system, according to his own account outlined in a Medium post. He led development of Autopilot’s traffic-aware cruise control and other driver assistance features before taking responsibility for the architecture of controls, safety, and functional behavior of the electric propulsion system. Biasini left Tesla and joined Comma.ai in 2016, where he developed the automated lateral and longitudinal controls for the startup’s first self-driving car system. He later became VP of quality and eventually was named CEO in 2018 after founder George Hotz stepped down from the leadership role. Biasini went back to work for Musk in 2019 as director of electrical and software engineering at The Boring Company. At DOGE, Biasini is senior advisor to the director of the Office of Personnel Management, according to a lawsuit filed against the OPM in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which provides his title as listed on an OPM document entitled “Privacy Impact Assessment for Government-Wide Email System.” Role: Acting DOGE administrator Amy Gleason is the acting DOGE administrator, according to the White House, making Gleason the official albeit ostensible head of the Department of Government Efficiency, even if Elon Musk is largely calling the shots. The White House confirmed Gleason’s position to TechCrunch. Gleason previously served at the U.S. Digital Service — now DOGE — between October 2018 and December 2021, according to her LinkedIn profile, which TechCrunch has seen. Gleason also previously worked as chief product officer at Russell Street Ventures between December 2021 and November 2024. Gleason, who was in Mexico on vacation at the time when she learned of her appointment, reports to the White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, per the executive order establishing DOGE. President Trump has continued to refer to Musk as heading and leading DOGE. Gleason has not made any public comments since her appointment, but was court-ordered to answer questions about DOGE’s role and whether it is a government agency subject to Freedom of Information laws. Role: Senior Advisor to the Commissioner and former Chief Information Officer, Social Security Administration Michael Russo, a former technology executive, began serving as the chief information officer at the Social Security Administration in early February. As CIO, Russo oversaw the agency’s IT systems and information security. In late March, DOGE associate Scott Coulter replaced Russo as the SSA CIO, according to the agency’s website. Russo began serving as a senior advisor to the Social Security Administration’s Commissioner. During his brief time as CIO, Russo, who is aligned with DOGE, reportedly quickly gave access to several DOGE staffers at the agency, including Akash Bobba and Coulter, among others, according to a lawsuit brought by unions representing workers and a person familiar with personnel matters. Several other DOGE staffers were listed as Russo’s direct reports in the department’s staff directory, the person familiar said. Russo was previously the chief technology officer at ecommerce firm Shift4 and was a senior director at cloud giant Oracle, headed by Larry Ellison, a close ally of President Trump. Role: Former DOGE staffer with an unspecified role at White House Stanley began working for Musk in October 2022, per his LinkedIn profile, when he was hired for the “core transition team” at Twitter after Musk’s takeover. Stanley can be seen at the time taking this widely seen selfie at Twitter’s headquarters with other people who were not fired or didn’t quit when Musk took control of Twitter. Stanley served in an unspecified role at the White House, according to The New York Times. Stanley himself has hinted at working in the Trump administration on his X account. Stanley “returned to the private sector” in February, per an OPM spokesperson. On January 20, the day of Trump’s inauguration, Stanley posed next to two January 6 convicts, brothers Matthew and Andrew Valentin, who were pardoned by Trump. Stanley wrote in an X post that he was “boots on ground to ensure this was executed.” Trump’s Department of Justice liaison Paul Ingrassia wrote on X that the Valentin brothers were the first January 6 prisoners to be released. Stanley currently serves as the head of security engineering at X and the principal security engineer at SpaceX, according to his website. On his LinkedIn, Stanley says he is also the chief information security officer at X Payments, a payment service that Musk has wanted to launch as part of his “everything app” aspiration for X. Before entering Musk’s orbit, Stanley had his own cybersecurity firm, named Stanley Networks, and worked as a contractor at the state of Kentucky. He also worked at Kentucky health provider Baptist Health, which includes hospitals and other facilities. TechCrunch found an xAI-powered chatbot on a DOGE-related website subdomain on Stanley’s website, called the “Department of Government Efficiency AI Assistant,” which says it is “here to help government personnel like you identify and eliminate waste, improve efficiency, and streamline processes using a first principles approach.” Role: Expert, Office of Personnel Management Akash Bobba is a DOGE engineer who is reportedly a student at the University of California, Berkeley, according to Wired. The New Jersey native graduated high school in 2021, according to public records seen by TechCrunch. It’s unclear how his experiences brought him to DOGE. But he has had some interactions with the tech world. According to a since-deleted podcast with Aman Manazir, Bobba said he previously interned at Meta and Palantir. He also worked at Bridgewater Associates. Bobba’s website as of February 2025 points to a specific point in a YouTube video, titled, “How Tech Billionaires Plan to Destroy America,” in which Elon Musk says, “I’m not just MAGA. I’m dark gothic MAGA.” Per Wired, Bobba is listed as an “expert” in internal OPM correspondence, and reports directly to OPM’s chief of staff, Amanda Scales. According to a lawsuit filed by union workers, Bobba also has a presence at the Social Security Administration and worked under the agency’s chief information officer, Michael Russo, according to the lawsuit and a person familiar with personnel matters. Bobba was sworn into his post “over the phone, contrary to standard practice,” per the lawsuit, implying Bobba worked for DOGE at least in part remotely. Role: Special Government Employee Edward Coristine, a former intern at Neuralink and now known by his infamous LinkedIn profile handle “bigballs,” is one of the core members of the DOGE team and the youngest-known Musk aide at age 19, TechCrunch has confirmed. Since arriving in Washington, D.C., Coristine has been actively involved in accessing federal systems at several government departments, including Office of Personnel Management, the SBA, GSA and USAID, the State Department, Homeland Security, and FEMA. Coristine reportedly also has physical access to buildings at the U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA. Prior to DOGE, Coristine ran several companies under his name from his family home in New York, including DiamondCDN and Packetware, both which offered forms of DDoS protection. Coristine also used to work for DDoS mitigation company Path Network until he was fired in June 2022 following an alleged “leaking of proprietary company information that coincided with his tenure,” Path CEO Marshal Webb told TechCrunch in an email. Coristine said in a later Discord post under his handle “Rivage,” seen by TechCrunch and per other news reports, in response to his firing that he had done “nothing contractually wrong.” It was around May 2024 that Coristine went to work for Elon Musk’s Neuralink. Coristine is also a mechanical engineering and physics student at Northeastern University, and expected to graduate in 2028. Role: Chief Information Officer and former IT Specialist, Social Security Administration Scott Coulter is a DOGE staffer who serves as the chief information officer at the Social Security Administration. Coulter was initially listed as an IT specialist in the Social Security Administration’s staff directory as of mid-February, according to a person familiar. Coulter succeeded Michael Russo in March 2025. Prior to working for DOGE, Coulter headed Cowbird Capital, a New York investment fund founded in 2018, which listed assets of around $171 million as of March 2024, per a regulatory filing. Both Coulter and Cowbird were named in court documents during the Twitter v. Musk lawsuit in 2022 during Musk’s takeover of Twitter, though it’s not clear why either were named. Coulter did not respond to a request for comment sent to his government email address. Role: Special Government Employee, U.S. Treasury Since joining DOGE, Marko Elez has become a central figure in a legal battle over DOGE’s access to some of the federal government’s most sensitive systems. Now as a senior Treasury employee, Elez has access to the U.S. Treasury’s payments systems responsible for disbursing around $6 trillion in federal funds to Americans, such as Social Security checks and federal tax refunds. Named in a lawsuit challenging DOGE’s access, Elez is a “special government employee” and reportedly had wide data access privileges to the department’s systems before that access was curtailed by a federal court. He works closely with Tom Krause, another DOGE staffer and senior Treasury employee. Per a February 11 court filing, Elez is the only DOGE staffer with access to payment systems. Before government, the 25-year-old Rutgers University graduate worked at SpaceX, where he focused on vehicle telemetry, Starship, and satellite software, according to an archived copy of his website seen by TechCrunch. Elez later worked on search AI at Musk’s social media company X, per an archived copy of his website. Elez does not list any prior government experience. On February 6, Elez briefly resigned from his position at DOGE, according to the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, after The Wall Street Journal surfaced racist posts from Elez’s social media accounts. Elez returned to government after Musk posted a poll on X asking whether Elez should be rehired. Elez was reinstated at DOGE, a Washington Post reporter posted on February 18. Luke Farritor is listed as a senior advisor in several U.S. government department employee directories, including the State Department, USAID, and the Department of Energy. He also requested access to data held by Medicare and Medicaid, as well as the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. Before government, Farritor, 23, was a student at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln and was well known for decoding the writings on ancient Roman scrolls, for which he won a $700,000 prize. Later, Farritor was among the 2024 Thiel Fellowship class, an annual award given by the billionaire Peter Thiel. An archived copy of Farritor’s website says he worked for Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, who he helped to “invest a large, multistage VC fund and help run AI Grant.” (Neither Friedman or Gross responded to a request for comment.) Farritor worked as an intern at Elon Musk’s satellite internet company Starlink in mid-2022, then went on to work at SpaceX between May 2022 and July 2023, where he worked on “several mission-critical projects” leading up to Starship Flights 1 and 2, per his website. Role: DOGE “Volunteer”; Federal Detailee Gautier “Cole” Killian is described as a DOGE “volunteer” who was designated a “federal detailee” at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in early February. A federal detailee is a federal employee usually seconded from another government agency. Killian was a student at McGill University in Canada where he studied math and computer science, and was a member of McGill’s AI team between 2021 and 2022. His personal website was scrubbed from the internet in late 2024, according to his website’s public DNS records. Role: Special Advisor to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management Gavin Kliger is an alum of University of California, Berkeley, and works at Databricks. Kliger joined the DOGE team earlier in 2025. Kliger is listed as special advisor to the director of the OPM on his LinkedIn profile, per Reuters, though much of Kliger’s online life, including his X account, has since been scrubbed from the internet, including the Wayback Machine, which archives copies of webpages in case they later become unavailable. A copy of Kliger’s resume that TechCrunch has seen said he previously interned at Twitter in mid-2019. According to an email sent to USAID staff, Kliger also has a USAID email address, and was one of the DOGE staffers who is now listed in the CFPB’s staff directory, according to the CFPB’s union. ProPublica reported in May that Kliger had been advised by government ethics attorneys he held stock in companies that federal employees are forbidden from owning, and as such could not take actions that would financially benefit him personally. Court records show Kliger participated in mass layoffs at the agency, including the terminations of the lawyers who had warned him about possible ethics violations. Role: Special Government Employee, U.S. Treasury; CEO, Cloud Software Group Tom Krause is a special government employee and a senior DOGE staffer in the U.S. Treasury. He concurrently serves as the chief executive of Cloud Software Group, a private company that owns several tech firms, including remote access giant Citrix, a once public outfit that went private through a series of deals. Bloomberg reports that Krause eliminated jobs at Citrix that staff said were critical to the security of the company’s products, according to multiple employees both named and unnamed for the story. Cloud Software Group told Bloomberg it inherited weaknesses at Citrix and faced rising security threats across the industry, and that cybersecurity has improved since its private equity buyout and meets or exceeds all industry standards. Before becoming CEO of Cloud Software, Krause, who is 47, was a former executive at Broadcom; prior to that he ran a consultancy firm. Since working at the Treasury as one of Musk’s DOGE front-line staffers, Krause has worked closely with Marko Elez, another senior Treasury employee. Politico reported in May, citing financial disclosures it had obtained, that Krause reported hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of shares in several financial, banking, and tech companies, including firms that provide services to the Treasury unit that Krause oversees. Jeremy Lewin is a DOGE staffer assigned to the General Services Administration, which oversees the federal government’s massive procurement and logistics operations, Bloomberg reported. Lewin reportedly failed to gain access to a secure GSA area, resulting in a superior of his lobbying the CIA for a clearance. Lewin is a 27-year-old Harvard Law School graduate who recently worked at the same law firm, Munger, Tolles & Olson, as did U.S. Second Lady Usha Vance, The Handbasket reported. Moghaddassi is part of a DOGE team assigned to the U.S. Department of Labor, and is one of several staffers that DOGE plans to install at the U.S. Treasury, per The New York Times. Moghaddasi has worked for at least three of Musk’s companies: X and Neuralink, according to multiple media reports, and a cached copy of Moghaddassi’s X account in 2023 said he also previously worked on AI at Tesla. Moghaddassi appears to be in his twenties. In 2019, he was a sophomore at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied applied math and computer science, the Santa Fe Institute’s website says. Nikhil Rajpal studied computer science and history at the University of California, Berkeley, where he served as the president of the libertarian-leaning student political group, Students for Liberty. According to archived snapshots of his website, Rajpal worked at Twitter from 2016 until some time before Musk’s acquisition. He may have first entered Musk’s orbit prior to this, reportedly doing work redesigning a Tesla console. On behalf of DOGE, Rajpal works at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and has a DOGE email address. Schutt is a technologist with longstanding links to Republican politics and was more recently linked to political operations by Elon Musk. Schutt reportedly has access to systems at FEMA. According to his since-deleted GitHub profile, which TechCrunch has seen, Schutt works at a company called Outburst Data. According to security researchers, Outburst Data hosts part of DOGE’s website and several other Musk-related sites, including his America PAC political fundraiser. TechCrunch has also seen the same DNS records, which reference a DOGE-named subdomain. On February 14, 404 Media reported a flaw that it said allows anyone to edit DOGE’s website. Schutt also serves as the chief technology officer at Revv, an online fundraising platform that is widely used by the Republican Party, as well as co-founder of Virginia-based software company KAMM. Ethan Shaotran, 22, and a California native, is a DOGE staffer and also a Harvard University student in the class of 2025. Shaotran was first publicly linked to Musk in September 2024, when he was runner-up in a hackathon run by the billionaire’s AI company xAI. Shaotran was previously the founder of Energize.ai, though its website no longer loads. He also developed several iPhone apps, including a Donald Trump-themed running game called “Donald Dash.” Shaotran reportedly has a working GSA email address and requested access to a decade’s worth of GSA data. Shaotran also has access to email systems at the Department of Education and access to the department’s back-end website. Shaotran was temporarily detailed to the Office of the Postmaster General at the U.S. Postal Service as of March 12, 2025, according to a Freedom of Information request. Role: Director of Technology Transformation Services, GSA; Chief Information Officer, Department of Labor. Thomas Shedd is a former Tesla engineer who now serves as the director of the General Services Administration’s Technology Transformation Services, or TTS, a unit known for designing and building digital services for the federal government. Since Shedd took charge of the unit, the GSA fired its 18F division of specialist technology consultants who worked on the Internal Revenue Service’s free tax-filing system and other government projects. Several staffers also reportedly resigned after Shedd gained access to parts of Notify.gov, a system that sends mass text messages to the public during emergencies, which contains the personal information of Americans who registered. As of mid-March, Shedd was also tapped as the chief information officer at the Department of Labor, which he serves concurrently as GSA’s technology director. Shedd reportedly is looking to reduce the agency’s headcount by 30%. Prior to working in federal government, Shedd worked at Tesla for eight years, according to the GSA, where he worked on “building software that operates vehicle and battery factories.” It’s not clear what prior government service Shedd has, if any, but he has said he wants to run TTS like a “startup software company,” according to Wired magazine, including the use of AI to analyze government contracts. Jordan Wick is a former Waymo software engineer who appears to have a DOGE email account associated with the Executive Office of the President, Wired reported. Wick is among the team that was given access to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau systems. Wick is also the co-founder of Y Combinator startup Intercept, according to YC’s website. An archived version of Wick’s website says that as of 2022, he had “recently” graduated with a master’s degree in engineering from MIT. Young is a DOGE staffer who works at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, per Bloomberg Law. Young is a “top Republican field operative” who was hired as Musk’s political advisor in 2024, The New York Times reported. Young has worked in Republican politics since at least 2007, according to his LinkedIn profile. ProPublica has since reported that Young earns as much as $1 million annually as a political adviser to Musk while also helping to dismantle the federal regulator and its consumer protection rules. Role: Unofficial Advisor to DOGE Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Silicon Valley VC firm Andreesen Horowitz, doesn’t formally work for DOGE but has acted as “a key networker for talent recruitment” at the agency, according to The Washington Post. Andreessen has jokingly referred to himself as an “unpaid intern” for DOGE, as well. Cooper is a Palantir engineer who worked on DOGE’s recruiting efforts in late 2024, according to Wired. He graduated from Pennsylvania’s Lehigh University in 2019 with a bachelor’s degree in computer science and business, according to his LinkedIn profile. Cooper worked to hire other Palantirians to join DOGE as they are “the most exceptional people I know,” he wrote in a message, seen by Wired. Hiremath, 32, is the co-founder of video recording startup Loom, which was sold to Atlassian in 2023 for $975 million. According to a blog post on his website titled “I am rich and have no idea what to do with my life,” Hiremath worked for DOGE in late 2024 for about a month making hundreds of recruiting calls. He wrote that he was added to DOGE-tied Signal groups and “immediately put to work.” While Hiremath praised DOGE’s work as “extremely important,” Hiremath said he quit as he needed to focus on himself, calling off plans to move to Washington, D.C. and going to Hawaii instead. Role: DOGE RecruiterJancso is a former Palantir software engineer who also worked on DOGE’s recruitment efforts late in 2024, according to Wired. In 2023, Jancso co-founded Accelerate SF, an initiative that taps engineers to solve the city’s problems with AI. Jancso’s exact age isn’t public, but he graduated from University College London in 2021 with a bachelor’s degree in economics according to his LinkedIn profile, seen by TechCrunch. Jancso was himself recruited to DOGE by Boring Company president Steve Davis. Kratsios helped lead efforts to staff DOGE in late 2024, conducting interviews of prospective staff, Bloomberg reported. Kratsios was previously managing director of Scale AI and the chief technology officer of the United States under President Trump’s first term. He was also a principal at Thiel Capital, a VC firm founded by Peter Thiel, from 2014 to 2017, according to his LinkedIn. Role: DOGE Advisor & Spokesperson Katie Miller is a Trump-appointed advisor to DOGE, and has served as its spokesperson. Miller served in the first Trump administration and is the spouse of Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller. Miller also serves on a presidential advisory board related to intelligence matters.

    "content": "Nearly two years after the layoffs across X’s trust, safety and security teams, Elon Musk’s social media company is now trying to hire new employees to help moderate content and secure its platform, according to X’s official job listings. In the last month, X posted two dozen job openings evenly split across its safety and cybersecurity teams. The jobs on X’s safety team range from director of strategic response on X’s safety team to government affairs managers. On its cybersecurity teams, X is hiring several security engineers and a threat intelligence specialist. These are small numbers compared to the number of staff Musk laid off following his $44 billion acquisition of the company, formerly known as Twitter, in late 2022. In April 2023, Musk told the BBC that Twitter, as it was known then, reduced its headcount by 6,000 workers in six months, leaving the company’s workforce at around 1,500 employees when layoffs were completed. Contact Us Do you work or used to work at X/Twitter, and have more information about the company’s security and safety? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email. You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop. Those cuts had included significant reductions for the company’s trust and safety team. In January this year, following an inquiry from Australia’s online safety commissioner, X said that it had laid off 80% of its trust and safety staff since Musk’s takeover. X also said in its responses that before Musk’s acquisition, the company had 279 engineers on its trust and safety teams around the world, which were cut down to 55 by the end of May 2023. Overall, X said it reduced its 4,062-strong trust and safety team by almost a third to 2,849 employees; its full-time content moderation team from 107 to 51 employees; and its contracted moderators from 2,613 to 2,305 employees, according to the Australian eSafety Commissioner’s report at the time. The recent job listings appear to confirm that X is trying to further beef up its safety team following the company’s announcement in January that it would create a new Trust and Safety center in Austin, Texas, which will include 100 full-time content moderators. Nine of the two-dozen jobs posted in the last month mention Austin among the possible locations, though the postings also include other cities, like New York City and Palo Alto, California, plus international offices like Manila in the Philippines and Delhi in India. When TechCrunch asked X’s press team a series of questions about these new hires, including the size of the company’s safety and cybersecurity teams, the company responded with an automated message: “Busy now, please check back later.” Departure’s in X’s trust and safety and cybersecurity teams have not been limited to its staff, but also included senior leadership. Since Musk took over, both the company’s chief cybersecurity officer Lea Kissner and the company’s trust and safety lead Ella Irwin have left. The reduction in staff on the trust and safety and cybersecurity teams appear to have hurt X’s ability to secure itself and its users, as well as deal with complex content moderation issues all over the world. On Friday, the Supreme Court in Brazil essentially banned X across the country after Musk refused to remove accounts spreading misinformation. Since taking over as Twitter’s owner, Musk himself has been accused of spreading hateful content and misinformation. On Tuesday, Musk promoted a podcast episode featuring a guest accused of engaging in Holocaust denialism. Also this week, Musk posted on X several images from an AI generator showing someone that looks vaguely like Vice President Kamala Harris wearing a beret with the Communist hammer-and-sickle. On the cybersecurity side, Musk hosted an X Spaces event with former President Donald Trump, which crashed and was delayed. Musk blamed the crash — without providing evidence — on “a massive [distributed denial-of-service] attack on X.” Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy.

    "content": "Knowde, an online marketplace for chemicals and polymers, just closed on a Series C round, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The San Jose-based startup raised $60 million in a round that values it lower than the $500 million valuation it garnered in its most recent round, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. This round values the company at north of 20x ARR, according to a source familiar with the transaction. The round included new investors: Blue Cloud Ventures and Point72 Private Investments in addition to existing backer Sequoia. The company has now raised more than $150 million in total venture funding. Its most recent round prior to this was a $72 million Series B led by Coatue; it closed in August 2021. Sequoia led the firm’s $14 million Series A round that closed in May 2020. Knowde launched in 2017 to bring the chemical and polymer market online. Co-founder and CEO Ali Amin-Javaheri is the child of a DuPont chemist; he’s spent his entire career in the industry. Prior to starting Knowde, Amin-Javaheri worked at ChemPoint, which also tried to introduce technology to the chemicals market, before pivoting to being a middleman distribution platform. Knowde currently has more than 8,000 chemical suppliers in its marketplace and works with such brands as Unilever, Johnson & Johnson and P&G, among many others.

    "content": "For the past few days, my Bluesky feed has been increasingly filled with mysterious posts about waffles. The back-and-forth seems to have started with a tongue-in-cheek post by Jerry Chen lampooning a form of social media sanctimoniousness that’s become all too recognizable on Bluesky: “(bluesky user bursts into Waffle House) OH SO YOU HATE PANCAKES??” Bluesky CEO Jay Graber quoted this approvingly, adding, “Too real. We’re going to try to fix this. Social media doesn’t have to be this way.” Another user then asked, “have y’all banned Jesse Singal yet or” to which Graber simply replied, “WAFFLES!” Singal’s presence on Bluesky was a flashpoint last year — while Bluesky built an early reputation as a haven for trans users, Singal has been widely criticized for his writing on trans issues. A Change.org petition arguing that Singal violated the social network’s community guidelines and calling on Bluesky to ban him received more than 28,000 signatures, and he was the most-blocked user on Bluesky until Vice President JD Vance surpassed him. In a follow-up post, Graber wrote, “Harassing the mods into banning someone has never worked. And harassing people in general has never changed their mind.” She also alluded to the controversy by posting a nudge-nudge wink-wink photo of waffles, as did Singal. Users continued to criticize her, with Graber firing back — when one compared the criticism to a customer threatening to cancel their service, she asked, “Are you paying us? Where?” When another suggested that she should apologize, Graber said, “You could try a poster’s strike. I hear that works.” It might be tempting to dismiss this whole thing as another example of leftist infighting, especially since the Bluesky Discourse has already moved on to the question of whether “clanker” is a slur. Or maybe, as one satirical account suggested, there’s just been “a week-long gas leak at Bluesky HQ.” But the controversy also underlines ongoing tensions between the company and some of its most vocal users. It’s a tension that could be seen last month in skeptical responses to the company’s updated community guidelines, and in recurring complaints that Bluesky has been too quick to ban Palestinian and trans users, while offering leniency to big accounts like Singal’s. It may be simplistic to reduce this tension to a single cause, but I suspect much of it comes from differing visions about what makes Bluesky special: If you think it’s Bluesky’s community, especially that early community of marginalized users, then it can feel like a betrayal when Bluesky executives seem unwilling to stand up for those users. One user who posts under the name Katie Tightpussy speculated that Bluesky leadership has come to loathe “having a large social media app that they never wanted” and suggested that they spin it off so they can return “to Protocol Land where they never have to think about the opinions of plebeians ever again.” Indeed, when Graber isn’t responding to criticism with posts about waffles, she’s resisted identifying Bluesky with any specific group or political leaning, instead emphasizing the decentralized protocol that allows users to build their own alternatives. Amidst the current controversy, she posted about “decentralization acceleration” and wrote, “We’re system architects at core. We built a decentralized network so you could run your own moderation,” then suggested that the company’s “upcoming healthy discourse project is taking some swings at the interaction model that drives these dynamics on Bluesky.” Graber may even have foreseen some version of this conflict when Bluesky was starting out with visions of a decentralized system that allows users to migrate elsewhere if they’re unhappy with company leadership. As she reportedly wrote in Bluesky’s founding documents, “The company is a future adversary.” Anthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "content": "The fundraising environment is challenging for emerging managers, defined as VC firms raising their first through third time. But Katie Jacobs Stanton, a former head of media at Twitter who founded Moxxie Ventures in 2019, said that she had a much easier time than she was expecting when raising funds for her third time. Moxxie, which invests in pre-seed and seed startups, announced on Tuesday that it closed a $95 million third fund, surpassing its target of $85 million. When the firm started fundraising, Stanton and general partner Alex Roetter, who was an SVP of engineering at Twitter, told limited partners that they didn’t intend to start deploying the capital until 2025. Luckily for them, their LPs, which include fund-of-funds Cendana Capital and Accolade Partners, the Nature Conservancy, the outsourced CIO Global Endowment Management, and several universities, were eager to back the firm. Cendana founder Michael Kim described Stanton’s network as one of the deepest and widest among seed-stage investors. “It didn’t take us as long as we thought to fundraise. We’re really happy about that, but you never know,” Stanton said. Although the five-year-old firm still hasn’t realized any meaningful exits, Stanton’s pre-Moxxie personal investing record through investment collective #Angels, which she co-founded with other female Twitter executives and alums, shows her investment prowess. She previously backed Carta, Coinbase and Airtable. The success of Moxxie’s portfolio companies has been more modest so far. When asked to highlight some companies, Stanton has pointed to startups like Certn, an identity verification company that last year raised an $80 million Series B, and Spellbook, an AI co-pilot for drafting legal contracts, which in January scored a $20 million Series A led by Innovia. Moxxie, whose name was inspired by the synonym for courage with an extra X for the female chromosome, has been on a mission of investing in underrepresented founders since its debut $25 million fund. Today, about a third of the firm’s portfolio companies are led by female founders and about a half have been founded by Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), according to Stanton. While the firm considers itself a generalist investor, it gravitates toward backing companies in health tech, climate tech, SaaS, and AI applications and has recently invested in a couple of robotics startups, including Jacobi Robotics, which is developing an AI-powered motion-planning technology. Moxxie’s median check size is $1.5 million, and the firm aims to acquire roughly 10% of each startup when making its initial investment. Stanton, who worked in the Obama administration during his first term, continues to be vocal about politics, the 2024 presidential election, and how VCs are being more public about their political preferences. She said that the current political transparency in the investing community is a good thing. In a world where capital remains a commodity, it can help founders decide who to choose as their backers because it shows “who can add value and who has values.” Marina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "content": "Social event planning app Partiful, which calls itself “Facebook events for hot people,” has firmly replaced Facebook as the go-to platform for sending party invitations. But what Partiful also has in common with Facebook is that it’s collecting a tsunami of user data, and Partiful could have done better at keeping that data secure. On Partiful, hosts can create online invitations with a retro, maximalist vibe, allowing guests to RSVP to events with the ease of ordering a salad on a touch screen. Partiful aims to be user-friendly and trendy, propelling the app to No. 9 on the iOS App Store’s Lifestyle charts. Google called Partiful the “best app” of 2024. Now Partiful has evolved into a powerful Facebook-like social graph, easily mapping who your friends are and who your friends’ friends are, what you do, where you go, and all of your phone numbers. As Partiful grew more popular, some users became skeptical of the company’s origins. One New York City promoter announced that it was boycotting Partiful because its founders and some staff are former employees of Palantir, Peter Thiel’s data-mining company, which produces the software that powers ICE’s master database for the Trump administration’s deportation crackdown. Given some of the speculation around the app, TechCrunch set up a new account and tested Partiful. We soon found that the app was not stripping the location data of user-uploaded images, including public profile photos. TechCrunch found it was possible for anyone, using only the developer tools in a web browser, to access raw user profile photos stored in Partiful’s back-end database hosted on Google Firebase. If the user’s photo contained the precise real-world location of where it was taken, anyone else could have also viewed the precise coordinates of where that photo was taken. Almost all digital files, like the pictures you take on a smartphone, contain metadata, which includes information like the file size, when it was created, and by whom. In the case of photos and videos, metadata can include information about the kind of camera used and its settings, as well as the precise latitude and longitude coordinates of where the image was captured. The security flaw is problematic because anyone using Partiful could have revealed the location of where a person’s profile photo was snapped. Some Partiful user profile photos contained highly granular location data that could be used to identify the person’s home or work, particularly in rural areas where individual homes are easier to distinguish on a map. It’s common practice for companies that host user images and videos to automatically remove metadata upon upload to prevent privacy lapses like this. TechCrunch verified the bug by uploading a new Partiful profile photo that we had previously captured from outside of the Moscone West Convention Center in San Francisco, which contained the photo’s precise location. When we checked the metadata of the photo stored on Partiful’s server, it still contained the exact coordinates of where the image was taken down to a few feet. After discovering the security flaw, TechCrunch alerted Partiful co-founders Shreya Murthy and Joy Tao by email, as Partiful does not have a public means for reporting security flaws. TechCrunch shared a link to a Partiful user’s raw profile photo containing that user’s real-world location at the time the photo was taken, a residential address in Manhattan. Tao told TechCrunch on Friday that the vulnerability was “already on our team’s radar, and was recently prioritized as an upcoming fix.” Partiful initially provided a timeline to fix the flaw by “next week,” but given the sensitivity of the data involved, TechCrunch requested the fix by Friday. Partiful confirmed it fixed the bug on Saturday. TechCrunch found by Saturday that metadata was removed from existing user-uploaded photos. The profile photo that we uploaded with our real-world location also had the metadata removed. Partiful disclosed the security lapse in a tweet shortly before the publishing of this story. When asked by TechCrunch if Partiful has the technical means, such as logs, to determine if there was any direct or bulk access to user profile photos stored in its database, Partiful spokesperson Jess Eames said this was “still under investigation but we have found no evidence of this yet.” Eames said the company “regularly [performs] security reviews with experts in the field, not just as a one-time action but as part of our ongoing processes.” Partiful did not provide TechCrunch with the name of the experts when asked. Partiful has raised over $27 million from investors since its founding in 2022, including a $20 million Series A funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz. TechCrunch asked Partiful’s co-founders if they had commissioned a security review of their product before launch, but they would not say. Zack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "content": "Zendesk announced Wednesday at its AI summit a string of LLM-driven products meant to reshape the company’s reliance on human technicians. The center of the new features is an autonomous support agent that Zendesk believes will solve 80% of support issues without human intervention. That system will be supplemented by a co-pilot agent, which will assist human technicians with the remaining 20% of issues, as well as an admin-layer agent, a voice-based agent, and an analytics agent. According to Shashi Upadhyay, Zendesk’s president of Product, Engineering and AI, the new agents are part of a broader change in the support industry, as AI replaces much of the work that was previously done by humans. “The world’s going to shift from software that’s built for human users, to a system where AI actually does most of the work,” Upadhyay told TechCrunch. Independent benchmarks suggest that contemporary AI models are capable of taking on the work. TAU-bench, which was designed to measure a model’s tool-calling ability, includes a scenario in which models have to process a returned product — a close analogue to many support tasks. The current leader, Claude Sonnet 4.5, solves 85% of issues on the test. After a chaotic investor fight in 2022, Zendesk has made a string of AI acquisitions that laid the groundwork for the current shift. The analytics agent launching today is built directly on the company’s Hyperarc acquisition, which was completed in July. Earlier AI acquisitions include the QA and agentic service system Klaus (acquired in February 2024) and the automation platform Ultimate (acquired the following March). Zendesk has previewed the new system with existing customers, and Upadhyay says the results have been promising. “For customers that have been using it, consumer satisfaction has been up by five to 10 points,” he told TechCrunch. Large language models have often been deployed for customer support, although rarely at the Zendesk’s scale. Companies from Airbnb to Regal Theaters have already experimented with in-house chatbot support, often contracting directly with foundation model labs. But those systems typically deal with information retrieval rather than more complex troubleshooting or taking self-directed action. If the new push for AI-based support is successful, the economic implications would be significant. Zendesk’s Resolution Platform already supports nearly 20,000 customers, resolving 4.6 billion tickets each year. Beyond Zendesk, the U.S. employs 2.4 million customer service representatives — with far larger workforces in other countries.

    "content": "AMD has signed a multi-year chip supply deal with OpenAI that could generate tens of billions in revenue for the chipmaker, helping accelerate its momentum in the AI industry. AMD has agreed to supply 6 gigawatts of compute capacity to OpenAI — enough to power up to 4.5 million homes — across multiple generations of its Instinct GPUs, starting with the Instinct MI450 GPU. OpenAI will receive the first gigawatt of capacity in the second half of 2026, when the new chip is scheduled for deployment. AMD claims the MI450 series will outperform Nvidia’s comparable offerings (Nvidia Rubin CPX) through hardware and software improvements, many of which will be made with OpenAI’s input. Its current MI355X and MI300X series GPUs, currently used in some workloads for OpenAI, are already strong for AI inference in large language models due to their large memory capacity and bandwidth. As part of the agreement, AMD has given OpenAI the option to buy up to 160 million shares of AMD stock, which amounts to a 10% stake. The first tranche will vest with the initial 1 gigawatt deployment, and additional tranches will vest as OpenAI buys up to the total 6 gigawatts, AMD said. OpenAI’s stake will also be directly tied to increasing AMD’s stock price milestones, with the final tranche vesting when the stock reaches $600 per share. For context, AMD shares closed at $164.67 on Friday, but started off Monday at $222.24, up nearly 35% following news of the deal. The deal comes as OpenAI works to secure as many chip partnerships as possible in its race to build out AI infrastructure, including five new Stargate data centers with a planned capacity of 7 gigawatts. “We are thrilled to partner with OpenAI to deliver AI compute at massive scale,” said Dr. Lisa Su, chair and CEO of AMD, in a statement. “This partnership brings the best of AMD and OpenAI together to create a true win-win enabling the world’s most ambitious AI buildout and advancing the entire AI ecosystem.” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement that the partnership is “a major step in building the compute capacity to realize AI’s full potential.” This is the latest of several deals the AI giant has made in recent weeks to secure compute capacity. Last month alone, Nvidia agreed to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI and supply the AI firm with at least 10 gigawatts; OpenAI and Broadcom also signed a $10 billion deal to develop and manufacture custom AI chips; and OpenAI said its Stargate initiative with Oracle and SoftBank would be expanding. Last week, OpenAI struck agreements with Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix to source DRAM memory chips for the Stargate project and build data centers in South Korea.

    "content": "Elon Musk’s AI startup, xAI, is creating its own version of ChatGPT. That appears to be the case, at least, from Musk’s tweets on X late Friday evening teasing the AI system xAI has been quietly developing. Called Grok — a name xAI trademarked recently — the system answers questions conversationally, possibly drawing on a knowledge base similar to that used to train ChatGPT and other comparable text-generating systems (e.g. Meta’s Llama 2). Grok leverages “real-time access” to info on X, Musk said. And, like ChatGPT, the system has internet browsing capabilities, enabling it to search the web for up-to-date information about specific topics. Grok has real-time access to info via the 𝕏 platform, which is a massive advantage over other models. It’s also based & loves sarcasm. I have no idea who could have guided it this way 🤷♂️ 🤣 pic.twitter.com/e5OwuGvZ3Z — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 4, 2023 Musk implied Grok will refuse to answer certain queries of a more sensitive nature, like “Tell me how to make cocaine, step by step.” Judging by a screenshot, the system answers that particular question a bit more wryly than ChatGPT; it’s not clear if it’s a canned answer or if the system is, in fact — as Musk asserts in a tweet — “designed to have a little more humor in its responses.” xAI’s Grok system is designed to have a little humor in its responses pic.twitter.com/WqXxlwI6ef Early Friday, Musk said that xAI would release its first AI system — presumably Grok — to a “select group” on Saturday, November 4. But in a follow-up tweet tonight, Musk said all subscribers to X’s recently launched Premium Plus plan, which costs $16 per month for ad-free access to X, will get access to Grok “once it’s out of early beta.” Separately, xAI is offering a “limited number” of users in the U.S. access to Grok. There’s a waitlist here. As soon as it’s out of early beta, xAI’s Grok system will be available to all X Premium+ subscribers Little’s known about Grok so far — or xAI’s broader research projects, for that matter. In September, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, a self-described close friend of Musk, said that xAI had signed a contract to train its AI models on Oracle’s cloud. But xAI itself hasn’t revealed anything about those AI models’ inner workings — or, indeed, what sorts of tasks they can accomplish. Or rather, it hadn’t until early Sunday, when xAI published a blog post detailing Grok — including the approaches taken to train it and the system’s underlying infrastructure. According to the post, the large language model driving Grok, Grok-1, was developed over the course of several months on a cluster of “tens of thousands” of GPUs (perhaps supplied by Oracle). Training data came from both the web (up to Q3 2023) and feedback from human assistants that xAI refers to as “AI tutors.” Grok-1 demonstrates “strong results” on common LLM benchmark tests, xAI claims — “surpassing all other models in its compute class.” And — as Musk alluded to — it has “a bit of wit” and “a rebellious streak,” answering “spicy questions that are rejected by most other AI systems” (although the jury’s out on what’s meant by “spicy,” exactly). “In some important respects, it (xAI’s new model) is the best that currently exists,” Musk was quoted as saying in a tweet Friday afternoon. Musk announced the launch of xAI in July with the ambitious goal of building AI to “understand the true nature of the universe.” The company, led by Musk and veterans of DeepMind, OpenAI, Google Research, Microsoft Research, Tesla and the University of Toronto, is advised by Dan Hendrycks, the director at the Center for AI Safety, an AI research nonprofit, and collaborates with X and other companies in Musk’s stead, including Tesla. In an interview with Tucker Carlson in April, Musk said that he wanted to build what he referred to as a “maximum-truth-seeking AI.” Is Grok this AI? Maybe — or it’s a step toward something even bigger. In the blog post, xAI hints at how its Grok-1 model might evolve down the line: “Grok doesn’t have other senses, such as vision and audio,” the company writes. “To better assist users, we will equip Grok with these different senses that can enable broader applications, including real-time interactions and assistance.” Musk’s AI ambitions have grown since the billionaire’s split with ChatGPT developer OpenAI co-founders Sam Altman and Ilya Sutskever several years ago. As OpenAI’s focus shifted from open source research to primarily commercial projects, Musk grew disillusioned — and competitive — with the company on whose board he sat. Musk resigned from the OpenAI board in 2018, more recently cutting off the company’s access to X data after arguing that OpenAI wasn’t paying enough for the privilege.

    "content": "Elon Musk’s xAI released its Grok large language model as “open source” over the weekend. The billionaire clearly hopes to set his company at odds with rival OpenAI, which, despite its name, is not particularly open. But does releasing the code for something like Grok actually contribute to the AI development community? Yes and no. Grok is a chatbot trained by xAI to fill the same vaguely defined role as something like ChatGPT or Claude: You ask it, it answers. This LLM, however, was given a sassy tone and extra access to Twitter data as a way of differentiating it from the rest. As always, these systems are nearly impossible to evaluate, but the general consensus seems to be that it’s competitive with last-generation, medium-size models like GPT-3.5. (Whether you decide this is impressive given the short development time frame or disappointing given the budget and bombast surrounding xAI is entirely up to you.) At any rate, Grok is a modern and functional LLM of significant size and capability, and the more access the dev community has to the guts of such things, the better. The problem is in defining “open” in a way that does more than let a company (or billionaire) claim the moral high ground. This isn’t the first time the terms “open” and “open source” have been questioned or abused in the AI world. And we aren’t just talking about a technical quibble, such as picking a usage license that’s not as open as another (Grok is Apache 2.0, if you’re wondering). 5 investors on the pros and cons of open source AI business models To begin with, AI models are unlike other software when it comes to making them “open source.” If you’re making, say, a word processor, it’s relatively simple to make it open source: You publish all your code publicly and let community to propose improvements or make their own version. Part of what makes open source as a concept valuable is that every aspect of the application is original or credited to its original creator — this transparency and adherence to correct attribution is not just a byproduct, but is core to the very concept of openness. With AI, this is arguably not possible at all, because the way machine learning models are created involves a largely unknowable process whereby a tremendous amount of training data is distilled into a complex statistical representation the structure of which no human really directed, or even understands. This process cannot be inspected, audited, and improved the way traditional code can — so while it still has immense value in one sense, it can’t ever really be open. (The standards community hasn’t even defined what open will be in this context, but are actively discussing it.) That hasn’t stopped AI developers and companies from designing and claiming their models as “open,” a term that has lost much of its meaning in this context. Some call their model “open” if there is a public-facing interface or API. Some call it “open” if they release a paper describing the development process. Arguably the closest to “open source” an AI model can be is when its developers release its weights, which is to say the exact attributes of the countless nodes of its neural networks, which perform vector mathematics operations in precise order to complete the pattern started by a user’s input. But even “open-weights” models like LLaMa-2 exclude other important data, like the training dataset and process — which would be necessary to recreate it from scratch. (Some projects go further, of course.) All this is before even mentioning the fact that it takes millions of dollars in computing and engineering resources to create or replicate these models, effectively restricting who can create and replicate them to companies with considerable resources. xAI open sources base model of Grok, but without any training code So where does xAI’s Grok release fall on this spectrum? As an open-weights model, it’s ready for anyone to download, use, modify, fine tune, or distill. That’s good! It appears to be among the largest models anyone can access freely this way, in terms of parameters — 314 billion — which gives curious engineers a lot to work with if they want to test how it performs after various modifications. The size of the model comes with serious drawbacks, though. You’ll need hundreds of gigabytes of high-speed RAM to use it in this raw form. If you’re not already in possession of, say, a dozen Nvidia H100s in a six-figure AI inference rig, don’t bother clicking that download link. And although Grok is arguably competitive with some other modern models, it’s also far, far larger than them, meaning it requires more resources to accomplish the same thing. There’s always a hierarchy of size, efficiency, and other metrics, and it’s still valuable, but this is more raw material than final product. It’s also not clear whether this is the latest and best version of Grok, like the clearly tuned version some have access to via X. Overall, it’s a good thing to release this data, but it’s not a game-changer the way some hoped it might be. It’s also hard not to wonder why Musk is doing this. Is his nascent AI company really dedicated to open source development? Or is this just mud in the eye of OpenAI, with which Musk is currently pursuing a billionaire-level beef? If they are really dedicated to open source development, this will be the first of many releases, and they will hopefully take the feedback of the community into account, release other crucial information, characterize the training data process, and further explain their approach. If they aren’t, and this is only done so Musk can point to it in online arguments, it’s still valuable — just not something anyone in the AI world will rely on or pay much attention to after the next few months as they play with the model.

    "content": "ChatGPT’s mobile app is raking in the revenue. Since launching in May 2023, ChatGPT’s app for iOS and Android devices has reached $2 billion in global consumer spending, according to a new analysis by app intelligence provider Appfigures. That figure is approximately 30x the combined lifetime spending of ChatGPT’s rivals on mobile, including Claude, Copilot, and Grok, the analysis indicates. So far this year, ChatGPT’s mobile app has made $1.35 billion, up 673% year-over-year from the $174 million it made during the same period (January-July) in 2024, per the data. On average, the app is generating close to $193 million per month, up from $25 million last year. That’s significantly higher — or about 53x higher — than ChatGPT’s next nearest competitor, Grok, which made approximately $25.6 million this year to date. Grok’s average monthly consumer spending is estimated at $3.6 million, or 1.9% of ChatGPT’s. This data suggests that other consumer chatbots still have a way to go to catch up with ChatGPT’s dominance on mobile devices, even if the numbers don’t provide a complete picture of the AI companies’ overall revenue. Consumers, teams, and businesses can also subscribe to AI plans on the web, and the companies generate revenue in other ways, too, like via their APIs. Rather, this new data offers a window into the apps’ traction with consumers, who discover and pay for these AI assistants via the mobile app stores. It’s also worth noting that when xAI’s Grok launched in November 2023 (after ChatGPT), Grok didn’t initially have stand-alone iOS or Android apps. Instead, users interacted with the AI chatbot through the X platform. Grok only became available on mobile devices through its own iOS app as of early January 2025 and has been on Google Play since March 4. Still, ChatGPT’s lifetime global spending per download is $2.91, compared to Claude’s $2.55, Grok’s $0.75, and Copilot’s $0.28, Appfigures found. In the U.S., ChatGPT’s spending per download to date is even higher, at $10, leading the market to account for 38% of the app’s revenue to date. Germany is the second-largest market, accounting for 5.3% of ChatGPT’s lifetime total spending. ChatGPT’s lead can also be seen in terms of downloads. To date, the app has been installed an estimated 690 million times globally, compared with Grok’s 39.5 million. (That puts X owner Elon Musk’s recent complaints about the App Store’s alleged favoritism of ChatGPT in its Top Charts into better context.) Average monthly downloads of ChatGPT globally are now at approximately 45 million, up 180% from about 16 million in January through July of 2024. In 2025 so far, ChatGPT’s app has been downloaded 318 million times, or 2.8x more than the 113 million it saw during the same period last year. By the number of installs, however, India is the top market, accounting for 13.7% of lifetime downloads, compared with second place, the U.S., which accounted for 10.3% of all downloads.

    "content": "Elon Musk is hyping the imminent release of his ChatGPT competitor Grok, yet another example of how his entire personality is just itself a biological LLM made by ingesting all of Reddit and 4chan. Grok already seems patterned in many ways off of the worst of Elon’s indulgences, with the sense of humor of a desperately unfunny and regressive internet troll, and biases informed by a man whose horrible, dangerous biases are fully invisible to himself. There are all kinds of reasons to be wary of Grok, including the standard reasons to be wary of any current LLM-based AI technology, like hallucinations and inaccuracies. Layer on Elon Musk’s recent track record for disastrous social sensitivity and generally harmful approach to world-shaping issues, and we’re already looking at even more reason for concern. But the real risk probably isn’t yet so easy to grok, just because we have little understanding yet of the extent of the impact that widespread use of LLMs across our daily and online lives will have. One key area where they’re already having and are bound to have much more of an impact is user-generated content. We’ve seen companies already deploying first-party integrations that start to embrace some of these uses, like Artifact with its AI-generated thumbnails for shared posts, and Meta adding chatbots to basically everything. Musk is debuting Grok on X as a feature reserved for Premium+ subscribers initially, with a rollout supposedly beginning this week. Clearly, Musk aims to dangle Grok as a carrot to attract more subscribers to his more expensive subscription tier for dumpster fire X. X will also inform Grok, which is its own cause for concern, given how far the network has fallen in terms of being a source of reliable info even from its not particularly stellar days as Twitter. The real threat isn’t even a woefully misinformation-laden chatbot deployed at scale on a network that was once roundly criticized by its current owner for being rife with bots; no, the real danger is what happens if Musk’s AI mini-me starts to drown out the rest of the discourse — and what happens if other moneyed megalomaniacs see it working out for him. Musk’s special ability as it stands is a sycophantic following with a willingness to accept his interpretation of reality, no matter how twisted or demonstrably untrue. But that’s nothing compared to an LLM trained on basically the same drivel, capable of not only parroting but also generating highly accurate novel “opinions” and “perspectives” made from the clay of their maker, and then of spreading them quickly with unfettered access to a network that still spans tens of millions of influential users. The only advantage that the many, many people who aren’t billionaires currently have over those that are is their very abundance — the masses are the masses because of, well, their mass. Despite what I’m sure are many clandestine offshore attempts to clone billionaires as an answer to this sticky math problem, it remains somewhat intractable. Yet the advent of LLM-based chatbots threatens to destabilize the very notion of popular opinion, by drowning out the voices of real users with countless artificial ones that are nigh-indistinguishable from authentic human beings. We’ve already seen the demagogues of late-stage capitalism try to claim a “populist” perspective that has no footing in actually being the will of the people. So far, though, they’ve mostly done that via bald-faced braggadocio; within a few iterations of the coming onslaught of LLM-powered chatbots, they could have the artificial, but convincing, numbers to back up their malign interpretations of the world.

The Tesla event, which begins at 1:30 p.m. PT September 22, kicks off with its annual shareholder meeting followed by the battery day activities. That’s today. Readers can watch the live stream here. Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting — like its earnings call — tends to be packed with announcements and updates and general ruminating and forecasting from Musk. Expect questions and hopefully answers about Tesla’s various construction projects around the world, including new factories in Austin, Texas and Berlin, as well as the expansion in Shanghai. Whether Musk provides an update on the Roadster and Tesla Semi is unclear. However, at least one tweet from Musk hints that the two products will come up during the Battery Day section of activities today. Musk noted that what is revealed today during Battery Day will affect long-term production, especially its Class 8 truck, the Tesla Semi, as well as its Roadster sports car and Cybertruck. “What we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022,” he wrote. Important note about Tesla Battery Day unveil tomorrow. This affects long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck & Roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 21, 2020 What many in the industry expect Tesla to announce is that it’s manufacturing its own battery cells, likely setting up production within the confines of its new factories as it continues to vertically integrate. Tesla’s $218 million acquisition of Maxwell Technologies in 2018 triggered speculation that the company was interested in developing and even manufacturing its own battery cells. Actions taken by the company in the past two years seem to support this. However, Tesla’s interest in developing better batteries was piqued long before it acquired Maxwell. In 2015, Tesla signed a five-year exclusive partnership with Jeff Dahn, a leading lithium-ion battery researcher and professor at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. The exclusive partnership with Tesla began in June 2016, after Dahn completed a project funded by 3M and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to develop longer-lasting, lower-cost lithium-ion battery cells. Expect the fruits of that partnership — which has produced a steady stream of patent applications — to be described in more detail today. Panasonic is Tesla’s primary battery cell supplier. The company has a joint venture with Tesla, manufacturing cells at the so-called Gigafactory in Sparks, Nevada. The initial plan was for the Gigafactory to produce 35 gigawatt hours of battery capacity, a goal it has reached. Now, Panasonic is adding another production line, an expansion that will increase battery cell capacity by 10%. The Gigafactory has been the centerpiece of Tesla’s plan to expand global battery capacity and reduce the cost of electric vehicles. Panasonic has been its most important partner in that project, which, based on a recent agreement, should last until at least 2023. That doesn’t mean Tesla hasn’t been dedicated to developing its own battery technology. Musk tweeted Monday that the company intends “to increase, not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic, LG & CATL (possibly other partners too). However, even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed, we still foresee significant shortages in 2022 and beyond unless we also take action ourselves.” We intend to increase, not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic, LG & CATL (possibly other partners too). However, even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed, we still foresee significant shortages in 2022 & beyond unless we also take action ourselves. And there’s plenty of evidence suggesting that the company has been working in earnest on its own batteries. In August 2019, Tesla received a permit from the Bay Area Air Quality District to operate a pilot battery manufacturing line at a facility in Fremont, California, near its vehicle assembly factory. The facility on Kato Road also had an application for what appears to be a more permanent permit, but it remains incomplete for data, which means the company never submitted all the necessary data for regulators to review. However, the air quality district has since issued two new permits, one for cathode coating and another simply described as “trade secret,” for the same Kato facility that has been tied to Tesla’s battery development in the past.

    "content": "Tesla reported Wednesday net income of $2.7 billion in the second quarter, up 20% from the same period last year as once again, the company’s EV price cuts dug into profits. The automaker has repeatedly reduced the cost of its four EV models in the United States, Mexico, Europe and China. The move helped boost sales in the first half of the year, with Tesla hitting record Q2 deliveries of 466,140 units. But it’s also taken chunks out of Tesla’s normally healthy automotive margins. For the second time this year, Tesla’s gross margins decreased to 18.2%, down from 25% in Q2 2022 and down from 19.3% last quarter. Tesla matched Wall Street revenue estimates of around $25 billion for the quarter, which is nearly 50% higher than year-ago sales of $16.9 billion. Most of the revenue came from Tesla’s automotive revenue, which hit $21.3 billion in Q2. That number includes $282 million from federal tax incentives. A small, but notable, chunk of Tesla’s Q2 revenue came from “services and other revenue,” which usually includes after-sales vehicle services and parts, retail merchandise, vehicle insurance and the Supercharger network. Tesla’s number of Supercharger stations and connectors increased 33% in the second quarter to 5,265 and 48,082, respectively. The automaker has been opening its network of Superchargers to other automakers in recent months, notably Ford and General Motors, and most recently Nissan. While charging isn’t a main revenue driver for Tesla, it’s possible that some of the increase came from Tesla opening up its charging network. Energy generation and storage revenue remained flat quarter-over-quarter, but grew 74% year-over-year. Tesla blames solar slump on interest rates as energy storage biz booms Tesla’s operating margin dropped slightly from 11.4% in Q1 to 9.6% in Q2. Its capital expenditures remained flat QoQ but increased 19% YoY. The company reported it spent $2 billion in capital expenditures, likely due to continued production ramping in the automaker’s Berlin and Texas gigafactories. Tesla’s Q2 earnings show that Berlin’s vehicle capacity increased by 25,000 units over Q1 reported numbers. Tesla closed out the quarter with $1 billion in free cash flow, which is up from the $441 million with which it finished the first quarter. Tesla stock closed at $291.26 Wednesday and dropped 5% in after-hours trading. Tesla’s full-year outlook hasn’t changed. “For 2023, we expect to remain ahead of the long-term 50% CAGR with around 1.8 million vehicles for the year,” reads Tesla’s earnings report. In Q1, Tesla delivered 422,875 vehicles globally. In the second quarter, that number hit 466,140 units, a 10% increase. If Tesla’s production and delivery capacity keeps increasing at around the same clip, the automaker will be able to reach close to 2 billion units by the end of the year. However, Musk did say Wednesday that Q3 production will decrease slightly, driven by planned downtime for factory upgrades. He noted that macroeconomic conditions are uncertain and could impact execution positively or negatively in the near term. Musk also defended Tesla’s many price cuts, saying it was a move to combat the potential for lower sales amid economic uncertainty. “When interest rates rise dramatically, we actually have to reduce the price of the car because the interest payments increase the price of the car,” said Musk. The executive noted that Tesla had also brought back its referral program in an effort to boost sales. Tesla finally built its much-delayed Cybertruck over the weekend at Giga Austin, but few details were shared at the time. During Wednesday’s earnings report, the company still left investors and analysts wanting more. “It’s always very difficult to predict the ramp initially, but I think we’ll be making them in high volume next year, and we will be delivering the car this year,” said CEO Elon Musk Wednesday. Musk also noted that “demand is so far off the hook, you can’t even see the hook,” emphasizing that the Cybertruck has “a lot of new technology…so the production ramp will move as fast as the slowest and least likely elements of the entire supply chain.” Tesla didn’t provide other information on the Cybertruck, like production capacity next year, pricing and more specs.

    "content": "Tom Zhu, Tesla’s China president who oversaw Gigafactory Shanghai’s transformation into the world’s largest EV plant, has been appointed to run the new Gigafactory in Austin, Texas, Bloomberg reported earlier this week. That would make the China chief, who joined Tesla China in April 2014, one of the top executives at the EV giant. The decision didn’t come as a surprise to industry insiders, given how quickly Gigafactory Shanghai became a cornerstone manufacturing and export hub for Tesla. It took the plant merely a year — from December 2018 to December 2019 — to go from construction to production. In August, Gigafactory Shanghai made its one-millionth car, accounting for a third of the total Teslas produced up until that point, Elon Musk tweeted. This November was a record month for the facility with 100,291 vehicles delivered. Such achievements no doubt make Zhu a preferred aide of Musk who promotes a “hardcore” work environment. While Zhu might have a secret recipe for building a well-oiled manufacturing team in a short time, China’s unique conditions aren’t easily replicable in another country. “Over the past three years, Gigafactory Shanghai has outperformed its counterparts in Fremont, Texas and Berlin, although [not all of the success] is attributable to Tom or the China team,” suggested Chris Zheng, founder of Chinese automotive blog Channel-Q. “A friendly regulatory environment, a strong supply chain base and an efficient front-line execution team — these are three factors that are currently only available in China, so the key isn’t Shanghai or Texas. Look at BYD. Granted, Tom and his executive team are excellent, but that’s not all,” he added. Chinese tech news site PingWest reported Wednesday that Musk has anointed Zhu as the CEO of Tesla Global, a new executive role in charge of sales and Gigafactories, while Musk continues to lead “key technical works at the firm.” Musk tweeted Thursday that he continues to “oversee both Tesla & SpaceX, but the teams there are so good that often little is needed from me.” Tesla forced to idle production at Gigafactory Shanghai again FLASH SALE ALERT: Register by Oct 17 and save up to $624 (or up to 30% on groups).Get the ticket type for you:Founders: Your next big connection and investor are here.Investors: Meet startups that align with your investment goals.Innovators & Visionaries: See the future of tech before everyone else.

    "content": "Elon Musk has dominated this summer’s headlines beyond the EV business he’s trying to scale. During the first half of July, the Tesla CEO commanded attention for adding twins to his brood of 10 children, backing out of a $44 billion deal to buy Twitter and going shirtless while yachting on the Aegean. Meanwhile, the far-reaching rounds of layoffs he initiated in the spring after voicing his “super bad feeling” about the economy have led to a spate of wrongful termination lawsuits. It’s enough to overlook the fact that Tesla’s bread and butter business — electric vehicles — seems to be in a precarious position. Tesla’s global deliveries fell nearly 18% in the second quarter compared to the first period — the automaker’s first quarter-over-quarter decline in two years — amid a supply chain crunch, factory shutdowns and a shortage of raw materials to make the batteries that power its vehicles. And while the company’s year-over-year delivery numbers were well in the black, the more recent quarterly decline has some wondering if this is just a blip or a sign of what’s to come the rest of the year. Tesla’s second-quarter financial report Wednesday should provide insight into how Tesla is managing these headwinds, as well as continuing to develop its Supercharger network and improve its Autopilot software. A call with analysts after the market closes on Wednesday will likely delve into other facets of the business and shed light on Musk’s long-term vision for the company. Per data from Yahoo Finance, analysts expect that Tesla generated Q2 2022 revenues of $17.2 billion and $1.85 in earnings per share. For the second quarter of 2021, Tesla reported $11.96 billion in revenue and $1.45 in earnings per share. After a stellar first quarter, Tesla showed that it’s not immune to the macro pressures that have slowed the global automotive industry. The company blamed its disappointing second-quarter production figures on COVID-19 lockdowns in China that shuttered its Gigafactory Shanghai. The spring openings of Tesla’s $5 billion Gigafactory Berlin – its first factory in Europe – and $1 billion Gigafactory in Austin didn’t help Tesla recoup the losses. The automaker’s global deliveries fell 17.9% to 254,695 electric vehicles in the second quarter, down from the 310,048 deliveries reported for the first quarter of the year. Tesla’s U.S. sales fell 18.3% to 131,449 units in the second quarter, compared with the same period last year, according to Autodata Corp. The automaker may provide an update Wednesday on its production outlook, as well as the status of its future lineup, which is set to include a Tesla Cyber Truck, Roadster and Semi. Last quarter, Tesla announced plans to cut costs and generate revenue at its Supercharger network by extending peak-charging hours at certain Superchargers and charging customers for the Gen 2 Mobile Connector Bundle that was historically included in the purchase price of a new Tesla. We’ll be tuning in Wednesday for updates on Tesla’s plans to expand its Supercharger network in the U.S. and turn its charging stations into profit centers. A White House memo in July revealed that Tesla plans to begin opening its Supercharger network to other electric vehicles by the end of the year. The rollout could help Tesla attract new buyers while profiting from customers of other EV brands. The question is how will Tesla manage its existing and loyal customers while bringing new non-Tesla drivers into the fold? We’re hoping Musk addresses that challenge during the call. Tesla’s Autopilot software made headlines this month as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opens special investigations into a spate of fatal crashes involving Tesla vehicles. The latest probe, announced Monday, seeks to ascertain whether Autopilot was engaged when a 2021 Tesla Model Y killed a motorcyclist in California. The federal safety agency is looking into several other fatalities involving Tesla vehicles in California and Florida. Meanwhile, Tesla appears to be disbanding the team developing its Autopilot technology. The automaker said last week that it’s laying off 229 data annotation employees who are part of the company’s larger Autopilot team, and is shuttering the San Mateo, California, office where they worked. Tesla announced the following day the departure of Andrej Karpathy, Tesla’s director of AI and leader of its Autopilot vision team. We’ll be listening for Tesla’s plans to develop its Autopilot software and improve its safety record. Musk has not spoken of the Master Plan 3 to scale Tesla to the “extreme” since he teased it in March. At the time, he tweeted that plans to deploy artificial intelligence and scale the automaker’s operations will dominate the next installment of Tesla’s long-term playbook. “Main Tesla subjects will be scaling to extreme size, which is needed to shift humanity away from fossil fuels, and AI,” Musk tweeted. “But I will also include sections about SpaceX, Tesla and The Boring Company.” Will talk of the Master Plan 3 resurface during Wednesday’s analyst call, or does the automaker have too much on its plate right now to plan its next act?

    "content": "Today after the bell American electric vehicle giant Tesla reported its first-quarter performance. The company detailed revenues of $18.76 billion and $2.86 worth of earnings per share, up from its Q1 2021 results of top line worth $10.389 billion and earnings per share of 93 cents. Tesla said it faced several challenges in the first quarter related to global supply chain, transportation, labor and manufacturing issues and that the problems could limit its ability to run its factories at full capacity. The automaker also warned of continued supply constraints that could hamper future production, despite the recent openings of its Gigafactories in Berlin and Texas that will build the Model Y. “Our own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through the rest of 2022,” the automaker said in its financial outlook. Tesla reported $3.32 billion worth of net income, a 658% increase from the $438 million reported for the same period last year. The company’s profit result stands out as it is by far the company’s largest in recent history, towering around $1 billion above its Q4 2021 net income results. The figures bested analysts expectations in both revenue and net income terms. Per data from Yahoo Finance, analysts expected that Tesla would generate Q1 2022 revenues of $17.8 billion, and $2.26 in earnings per share. Shares of the company are up around 4% in after-hours trading, after shedding nearly 5% of their value during regular trading. The company’s quarter is hard to fault. Revenues at Tesla rose 81% on a year-over-year basis, a figure bested by 87% growth in automotive revenues across a similar time frame. Even more, the company’s operating expenses only ticked up 15% compared to the year-ago quarter, giving the EV company a huge jump in its operating margin — that figure rose from 5.7% in the year-ago quarter, to 14.7% in the final quarter of 2021, to 19.2% in its most recent three-month period. While Tesla’s overall figures were strong in the quarter when compared to expectations, it was the company’s automotive business that stood out. In contrast, Tesla’s “energy generation and storage” revenues, which combines energy storage and solar, came to $616 million — slimmer than what it managed in quarters two, three and four in 2021. The company did beat its year-ago energy and storage top line result of $494 million, however. (Notably the company’s solar deployments fell sharply in the quarter, and energy storage deployments, measured in megawatt hours, posted a gain from year-ago results, but a weaker total tally than quarters two, three and four saw last year. Again when we dip a toe deeper into the numbers, things look good. Tesla’s automotive gross margin also posted what was at least a local maximum, rising to 32.9% from 26.5% in Q1 2021, and 30.6% in Q4 2021. Tesla’s revenue from regulatory credits more than doubled over the previous quarter, to $679 million. Finally from a big-number perspective, Tesla’s operating activities kicked off just under $4.0 billion worth of cash in the quarter, up 143% from its year-ago result of $1.64 billion. Notably Tesla generated more positive operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2021 than it did to start 2022, but the decline feels modest when compared to the year-ago comparison. Despite these rosy numbers, there is one figure that illustrates the company’s challenges. Supply chain issues are visible inside of Tesla’s listed “global vehicle delivery” number, which is measured in number of days of available supply. From a peak of nine days’ worth of cars in Q2 2021, Tesla reported just a third of that figure, a slim three days, in Q1 2022. That figure is closer to the company’s Q4 2021 result of four days’ worth of inventory, at a roughly flat production level. Same production with less slack? Sounds like a supply chain matter.

    "content": "While onstage at Tesla’s annual shareholder event, CEO Elon Musk hinted that the automaker would choose the location for a new gigafactory by the end of the year. Musk jokingly asked his fans where the company should build, and when a few yelled out “Canada!” Musk replied, “I’m half Canadian. Maybe I should.” It seemed like a throwaway comment at the time, but a July lobbyist registration from Tesla reveals the company might actually have its eyes set on the U.S.’s neighbor to the north. Tesla recently added an amendment to its registration with Ontario’s Office of the Integrity Commissioner that sets forth the automaker’s plans to engage with the Ontario government to identify opportunities for “industrial and/or advanced manufacturing facility.” To sweeten the deal, Tesla’s lobbyists propose such a facility could “increase the competitiveness of Ontario and its ability to attract capital investment.” Tesla did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s requests for comment. Ontario may not need much of a push to welcome a Tesla gigafactory into its lands. The region already has a thriving automotive ecosystem that plays off its neighbor Detroit. Ford and General Motors already have existing plants there. In fact, in April, the Canadian government invested about $415 million into GM’s two new plants in Ontario, including one that will produce electric vehicles. “By making Ontario a competitive business environment, including reducing the cost of doing business by $7 billion annually, we have attracted nearly $16 billion in electric vehicle investments in the last 20 months,” Vic Fedeli, minister of Ontario’s economic development, job creation and trade, said in a statement shared with TechCrunch. “We are building an end-to-end supply chain right here in Ontario, and expect to continue to see more companies from around the world looking to our province as a place to invest and grow.” Musk said during the shareholder meeting last week that Tesla could ultimately have 10 to 12 gigafactories globally. Even though Tesla has opened gigafactories in Berlin and Shanghai, the U.S. still makes up for the vast majority of Tesla vehicle sales globally, so it makes sense the company might choose another North American location for its next factory — especially considering the headaches the Shanghai factory has endured, what with consistent lockdowns and factory line updates causing vehicle sales in China to fall. It’s possible that Tesla is rushing to find locations to build batteries and vehicles closer to home after the Inflation Reduction Act was approved on Sunday by the U.S. Senate. The $430 billion bill could restrict automakers from using Chinese-made materials and require them to use North American-sourced battery components if they want to be eligible for consumer tax credits for EV purchases.

For example, the shareholder meeting to approve the merger is scheduled 9:30 a.m. ET on March 31, 2022. Gogoro expects to make $550 million when it goes public, which includes an oversubscribed PIPE (private investment in public equity) of $285 million and $345 million held in trust by Poema Global. The company will use the funds to expand further into China, India and Southeast Asia. The company’s prospectus details much of the Taiwanese company’s concerns regarding its dealings with China. “Changes in the policies, regulations, rules, and the enforcement of laws of the PRC government may be quick with little advance notice and could have a significant impact upon Gogoro’s ability to operate profitably in the PRC,” the filing said. “The business, financial condition and results of operations of Gogoro, and/or the value of Gogoro’s securities or its ability to offer … securities to investors may be materially and adversely affected to the extent the PRC government intervenes or influences Gogoro’s operations.” The risk factors go on to detail how Gogoro’s operations may be subject to a variety of PRC laws regarding cybersecurity and data protection, which might result in Gogoro spending additional resources and incurring time delays to complete the business combination or be prevented from pursuing certain investment opportunities. Berlin-based e-bike subscription startup Dance is expanding to Hamburg, Munich, Vienna and Paris, giving customers an e-bike for €79/month. It’s also acquiring moped subscription startup Rollich. Super73 released a ton of new e-bike models, including its first electric motorcycle, at SXSW. The motorcycle is just a concept vehicle, but the other models include an a-bike for kids. Get ’em while they’re young. Audi of America partnered with Spoke, a mobility platform for safety, Qualcomm and Commsignia to bring the benefits of cellular vehicle-to-everything tech to enhance safety for motor vehicles and bicycles. With its partners, Audi is developing hardware and software for cars to help them read their surroundings to identify nearby bicycles. Remember about six weeks ago when autonomous vehicle company Cruise unlocked a $1.35 billion investment from Softbank Vision Fund after launching a limited driverless robotaxi service to the public in San Francisco? Welp, General Motors now owns a helluva a lot more of the company. GM said late Friday it is buying Softbank Vision Fund 1’s equity ownership in Cruise for $2.1 billion. GM said it’s also making an additional $1.35 billion investment in Cruise, replacing a previous commitment made by the fund in 2018. GM acquired Cruise back in 2016. Within a couple of years, GM expanded the circle a bit, bringing in investment from Softbank as well as $2.75 billion from Honda as part of an exclusive agreement to develop and produce a new kind of autonomous vehicle. The pool of investors would grow again with T.Rowe Price & Associates and, more recently, Microsoft. It’s unclear who prompted the buyback. Was Softbank unhappy with progress and looking to claw back some of its investment, or was this driven by GM? Or perhaps a combination. It seems, from at least where I sit, GM is laying a foundation for a future spin out and even an IPO for its subsidiary. Other deals that got my attention … EO Charging, the British EV charging company, ended its merger agreement with First Reserve Sustainable Growth Corp. Flash, the cloud parking software startup, nabbed a more than $250 million strategic investment from Vista Equity Partners, money that it will use to expand its mobility operating system and payments platform and invest into new talent. Getir, the instant delivery startup, closed a new $768 million Series E funding round led by Mubadala Investment Company, with Abu Dhabi Growth Fund (ADG), Alpha Wave Global, Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global also participating. Following this deal, the company reached a valuation of $11.8 billion. GoTo Group, the Indonesian tech firm that formed last year via a merger between ride-hailing giant Gojek and marketplace Tokopedia, plans to raise at least $1.1 billion from an initial public offering scheduled for April 4. The company said it aims to sell up to 52 billion new Series A shares at between 316 rupiah and 346 rupiah apiece, raising $28.8 billion at the top end of the range. Moove, an African mobility fintech startup that provides vehicle financing to drivers of ride-hailing platforms like Uber and other gig networks, raised $105 million in a new Series A2 round led by Speedinvest and Left Lane Capital. Existing investor thelatest.ventures also participated, alongside new backers such as AfricInvest, MUFG Innovation Partners, Latitude and Kreos Capital participated. Shift, the used car e-commerce platform, acquired some of competitor Fair Technologies’ technology, allowing Shift to become the Amazon of the used car marketplace, a platform that displays third-party listings from dealers alongside the company’s own inventory. TuSimple, the autonomous vehicle company that is backed by Chinese social media firm Sina Corp, is evaluating whether to sell its business in China and only operate in the U.S after reaching an agreement with the U.S. government to restrict its data due to U.S. security concerns. Whale Dynamic, a Shenzhen-based autonomous delivery startup founded by Baidu veteran David Chang, said it has closed a seed round of about $2.5 million. Qianchuang Capital, a Beijing-based investment firm managed by veterans from China’s leading financial institutions, led the round, with participation from Shangbang Huizhong, a Chinese fund backed by real estate developers. Zomato, the food delivery firm, and instant delivery service Blinkit have reached an agreement for a merger, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The all-stock deal values Blinkit between $700 million and $750 million, the source said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private. Argo AI has released Argoverse 2, the second version of its collection of open-source autonomous driving data and high-def maps from Austin, Detroit, Miami, Pittsburgh, Palo Alto, and Washington, D.C. The company is also sharing a lidar dataset to fuel research into new methods of ML using unlabeled point cloud data. Aurora built a transferable hardware kit that will help it develop autonomous trucks and cars in parallel, as well as power those vehicles with its Aurora Driver. Solo Advanced Vehicle Technologies wants to build electric, purpose-built heavy-duty truck platforms for autonomous freight. Ford said it will launch three new electric passenger vehicles and four new electric commercial vehicles in Europe over the next two years, an acceleration of its plans to sell more EVs in the region on its way toward reaching carbon neutrality in the region by 2035. Side note: Ford’s Advanced Manufacturing Center has developed a patent-pending system that solves a bottleneck in the production line by using robots to operate the 3D printers through the night without human interaction. Maserati plans to launch a battery-electric version for each model in its portfolio by 2025 and phase out gas engines by the end of the decade, making it the latest to join the long list of marques from Aston Martin to Volvo that has pledged to go electric. Porsche provided an update on its strategy during its annual meeting, a plan that will now include producing an all-electric 718 followed by a Macan EV as well as building out its own proprietary global network of charging stations next year, a departure from its initial strategy to rely on partnerships with other companies. Stellantis and LG Energy Solution will build their new EV battery plant in Ontario, Canada. Tesla idled its Shanghai Gigafactory for two days amid a rise in China’s Omicron cases that has prompted the government to tighten restrictions there. The automaker sent a notice to employees and suppliers on Wednesday informing them of the closure, reported Reuters, which viewed the internal memo. Volta, the EV charging company, is working with Tanger Factory Outlet Centers to install charging stations at Tanger locations in nine markets in the U.S., with expectations to grow in the coming months. Lyft and Uber are adding temporary fuel surcharges to fares for ride-hail and deliveries as fuel prices around the country rise. The rising prices are due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has resulted in a mountain of economic sanctions from the west against Russia, including the U.S.’s ban last week of Russian oil imports and the U.K.’s promise to ease its dependency on Russian fuel by the end of the year. The Biden administration awarded $409 million in grants to 70 projects in 39 states to modernize and electrify America’s buses and improve safety. Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley’s total compensation skyrocketed 93% to $22.8 million in 2021, an increase largely due to stock awards, which more than tripled to about $16 million, according to the company’s annual proxy statement. Farley’s pay included a $1.7 million base salary, a 19% increase from 2020. His compensation also included $830,305 for personal use of aircraft.

    "content": "Hello and welcome back to Max Q. It was a big week for private spaceflight. As usual, send feedback, comments and tips to aria.techcrunch@gmail.com. You also can catch me on Twitter at @breadfrom. Don’t forget to sign up to get the free newsletter version of Max Q delivered to your inbox. Axiom Space’s inaugural fully private space mission is a go. The four-person crew took off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center inside a SpaceX Crew Dragon atop a Falcon 9 rocket on Friday, where they headed to the International Space Station for an eight-day stint. This is the first of many planned missions for Axiom, which aims to send its next batch of private citizens to the ISS in 2023. Axiom is not only in the business of private spaceflight — the company was also tapped by NASA to install commercial modules on the ISS, with the first module going up in late 2024. The company’s eventual aim is to separate the modules and operate them as a new station upon the ISS’ retirement at the end of the decade. San Francisco-based startup Astranis has purchased a dedicated launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. That’s right: Instead of using a “rideshare” model, where multiple companies split the cost of launch, Astranis has booked out the entire rocket, in an exclusive mission that the company says will put its package of four communications satellites closer to their target orbit in a much faster amount of time. “We’re actually using substantially less than the max capability of a Falcon 9,” Astranis CEO and founder John Gedmark explained. “This is just four small satellites that [will be] on there. So we’re actually able to use all of that extra performance to put those four satellites much closer to GEO than you would normally be able to do with this kind of launch.” Astranis manufactures MicroGEO satellites, so named because they are much smaller and lighter than the typical geostationary communications satellites that are in orbit today, coming in at around 1/20th the size and cost. The four satellites that will launch next summer already have dedicated customers, including Latin American telco company Grupo Andesat and Anuvu, which provides internet connectivity on airplanes and cruises. Jordan Noone is co-founder and founding CTO of Relativity Space, and also co-founded both Embedded Ventures and KittyCAD. Before that, he led University of Southern California’s Rocket Propulsion Laboratory for two years, overseeing the development and launch of the first two entirely student-built rockets with capability of reaching the altitude of space, over 100km high. Those flights resulted in him becoming the first student, and youngest person in the world, to get FAA clearance to fly a rocket to space. From there, he worked on crewed spaceflight propulsion systems at both Blue Origin as an intern, and then SpaceX full-time, before starting Relativity in 2015 when he was 22 years old. TechCrunch: What are you working on? Jordan Noone: My time is split between Embedded Ventures, the venture capital fund that Jenna Bryant and I founded together in 2020, and KittyCAD as CEO, which is a startup we spun out of the fund last year. Embedded invests in dual-use space startups beyond launch, riding the disruption wave of falling launch costs from the last two decades of commercial launcher development. KittyCAD brings code to hardware, providing code infrastructure for hardware design automation. They both branch out from my co-founding Relativity Space and as CTO for the first six years — Embedded: investing in the future applications of launch, next-generation additive manufacturing and next generation digital engineering tools for hardware design — and KittyCAD: solving the bottlenecks on the design floor of cutting-edge hardware companies, rather than what we solved through 3D printing on the factory floor at Relativity. What’s something that happened in the news in the last week that you can’t stop thinking about? My alma mater, USC, through a donation from the Embedded Ventures team, brought back Project Payload: a program in which middle school-aged girls experience what it’s like to have a career in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) through the design of rockets, payloads and satellites, along with programming. These hands-on programs are instrumental in creating interest in STEM for individuals under-represented in those fields today. A portion of the donation from Embedded Ventures will be made in honor of Summer Medford, a 2019 Project Payload alumna, who passed shortly after graduation from the program. We first learned about the program when Relativity sent volunteers to support the project years ago, however after that year, the previous donor cut the support for the program. What are you looking forward to next week? I’ve been fortunate to be on the entrepreneurial journey that I’ve had. The only goal that has ever resonated with me is to make the opportunity for that journey easier and more accessible for the next generation. That’s why we started Embedded, to support founders and tech areas overlooked by the mainstream venture community. That’s why we support programs like Project Payload and our other education outreach work. KittyCAD provides the tools needed by innovators designing world-changing hardware, Relativity allows iteration and imagination to flow freely in some of the world’s most complex hardware projects. I look forward to next week, and all my weeks, because they are full of the work required to see that goal happen. I am surrounded by equally ambitious people and teams working towards either the same goal, or goals that I believe in seeing happen. The beat from KittyCAD’s new website. My favorite photo of the week: A view of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket next to NASA’s Space Launch System, the first time two different types of rockets made to carry humans have been on launch pads at Kennedy Space Center at the same time. The photo was tweeted out on KSC’s Twitter page. Max Q is brought to you by me, Aria Alamalhodaei. If you enjoy reading Max Q, consider forwarding it to a friend.

    "content": "SpaceX’s Dragon capsule is once again heading to the International Space Station. The company launched its 22nd Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) mission for NASA on Thursday. This is the fifth capsule SpaceX has sent to ISS in the last 12 months, SpaceX director of Dragon mission management Sarah Walker noted in a media briefing Tuesday. It’s also the first launch of the year on a new Falcon 9 rocket booster. The rocket took off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 1:29 PM eastern time, right on schedule despite the threat of storm clouds from the south and east. The first stage separated as planned and touched down on the “Of Course I Still Love You” droneship in the Atlantic Ocean eight minutes after launch. The second stage, which takes the capsule to orbit, separated 12 minutes after launch, also right on schedule. The Falcon 9 Rocket launch vehicle is sending more than 7,300 pounds of research materials, supplies and hardware, including new solar arrays, to the ISS crew. It’s the second mission under SpaceX’s new CRS contract with NASA; the first took place last December. Dragon is carrying a number of research experiments to be conducted on the ISS, including oral bacteria to test germ growth with Colgate toothpaste; a number of tardigrades (also affectionately called water bears), primordial organisms that will attempt to fare and reproduce in space environments; and an investigation that will study the effects of microgravity on the formation of kidney stones — an ailment that many crew members display an increased susceptibility to during spaceflight. The capsule is also delivering fresh food, including apples, navel oranges, lemons and avocados. Acquisition-happy space infrastructure company Redwire set to go public via SPAC Of the over 7,300 pounds of cargo, around 3,000 pounds will be taken up by a new roll-out, “flex blanket” solar array developed by space infrastructure company Redwire. As opposed to more traditional rigid paneled solar arrays, flex blanket technology provides more mass and performance benefits, Redwire technical director Matt LaPointe told TechCrunch. The arrays were placed in the Dragon’s unpressurized trunk. It’s the first of three missions to send iROSA solar arrays to the station, with each mission carrying two arrays, LaPointe said. Once installed, the six iROSA arrays will collectively produce over 120KW of power. Redwire, which announced in March that it would go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, says the new iROSA arrays will improve the ISS’s power generation by 20-30%. The Dragon capsule is set to arrive at the space station at around 5 AM on June 5, where it will autonomously dock on a port of the Harmony module of the ISS. It will spend more than a month with the station before splashing down in the Atlantic with research and return cargo.

    "content": "Discovery has ordered a new reality show, to air in 2022, which will be an eight-episode competition series where competitors will vie for a chance to take a trip to the International Space Station on a commercial Axiom Space mission. The winner will be a crew member for AX-2, the second mission from Axiom to transport a fully private group of space travelers to the ISS following AX-1, which is set to take place as early as next January. Axiom and NASA went into detail about AX-1 earlier this month in a press briefing, explaining that the mission will span eight days and take four paying customers to the orbital science station for a brief stay, with an overall price tag of $1.69 million being paid to NASA for the privilege (which excludes the value of some in-kind supply transport services that Axiom is providing). Axiom Space and NASA detail first fully private human launch to the Space Station, set for January 2022 Axiom will be using a SpaceX Falcon 9 and Crew Dragon spacecraft to transport its private astronaut customers to the ISS for AX-1. The initial press materials for the “Who Wants to Be an Astronaut?” series doesn’t specify which vehicle will be used for the AX-2 mission that will play host to the winner, but it’s reasonable to expect it’ll be SpaceX for that one as well, given that it’s the only fully private trip provider active so far. Here’s how Discovery describes the actual selection process that will take place during the reality series: [W]hat does it take to win a coveted seat to space? The process will be grueling and only a select few will make it through the rigorous selection process. The series will follow each of the contestants competing for the opportunity in a variety of extreme challenges designed to test them on the attributes real astronauts need most, and as they undergo the training necessary to qualify for space flight and life on board the space station. In the end, one lucky candidate, deemed to have the right stuff by a panel of expert judges, will punch their ticket for an adventure few have ever taken. The series will chronicle each pivotal moment along the way – from lift off to re-entry and the return home.

    "content": "Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft is officially on its way to the International Space Station, marking an historic first for the long-delayed astronaut transportation program. Inside the spacecraft are two NASA astronauts — spaceflight veterans Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams — who are set to arrive to the station on Thursday. The spacecraft lifted off at 10:55 a.m. ET from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center aboard an Atlas V rocket from United Launch Alliance (a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture). The liftoff comes after a string of delays that pushed the mission back by nearly a month, first due to issues with the Atlas rocket and later due to a problem with one of the three ground computers responsible for the launch countdown. While there are more milestones Starliner must hit before Boeing and NASA can call the mission a success — docking to the ISS and eventually returning the astronauts back to Earth — it’s still a historic leap forward for the aerospace giant’s long-delayed astronaut transportation program. If all goes to plan, Boeing will become NASA’s second astronaut transportation provider, joining Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Both companies were awarded multi-billion-dollar NASA contracts to develop a crewed taxi service a decade ago, but Boeing’s program has been beset by technical delays that have run the company more than $1.5 billion over budget. Boeing did execute a successful uncrewed mission to the ISS in May 2022, but this is the first time the spacecraft has carried humans. While Boeing has struggled, SpaceX has soared: Using its Crew Dragon capsule, SpaceX has been providing astronaut transportation to and from the ISS since 2020. Wilmore and Williams will make an around 26-hour journey to the ISS, with an anticipated arrival of around 12:15 p.m. EST Thursday. During their journey, they’ll perform a handful of flight test objectives to support Strainer’s certification for regular missions. They’ll need to demonstrate the performance of crew equipment from prelaunch to ascent, and assess Starliner’s thrust performance, test navigation systems, conduct communication checkouts, and evaluate life-support systems. Even after Starliner autonomously docks to the station and the crew are onboard the ISS, the two astronauts will evaluate even more of the spacecraft’s performance, including determining whether it can act as a “safe haven” for astronauts in the unlikely event of an issue aboard the space station. Wilmore and Williams will remain onboard the station for around a week before reboarding the spacecraft. After just six hours, Starliner is expected to make a landing under parachutes and assisted by airbags somewhere in the southwestern United States. This is the last major step before Starliner can be certified as an operational crew system, and the first Starliner mission is expected to launch in 2025.

    "content": "SpaceX is set to make a change to its Crew Dragon spacecraft for its forthcoming history-making all-civilian launch, currently set for September 15. That Dragon will replace its International Space Station docking mechanism with a transparent dome, through which passengers will be able to take in an awe-inspiring panorama of space and the Earth from an orbital perspective. The glass dome will be at the “nose” of the Dragon capsule, or its topmost point when it’s loaded upright on top of a Falcon 9 rocket readying for launch. There should be space for one passenger to use it at a time, and it’ll be opened up once the spacecraft is safely out of Earth’s atmosphere, exposed by a protective cover that can be flipped back down to protect the observation deck when the spacecraft re-enters on its return trip. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk called it “the most ‘in space’ you could possibly feel” in a tweet sharing a concept render of the new modification in use. During a press briefing for the upcoming tourist flight, which is called “Inspiration4” and led by billionaire Jared Isaacman, it was described as being similar to the exiting cupola on the International Space Station in terms of the views it affords. SpaceX alumni are helping build LA’s startup ecosystem Probably most “in space” you could possibly feel by being in a glass dome https://t.co/SOAIzxVGgX — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 30, 2021 The ISS cupola is an observatory module built by the European Space Agency (ESA) and installed in 2010. Based on these renders from SpaceX, the Dragon version will be a continuous unbroken transparent surface, whereas the ISS cupola is made up of segmented panes separated by support structure, so that could mean Dragon provides a better view. This modification could pave the way for a more permanent alternate configuration of Dragon, one best-suited for SpaceX’s planned commercial passenger missions, most of which will likely aim to do orbital tours without any actual docking at the ISS. It’s possible the company will make further cabin modifications when the vehicle isn’t configured for crew delivery to the orbital science station. SpaceX also revealed new details about the Inspiration4 mission today, including its planned launch date of September 15, and a three-day mission flight duration. The remaining two passengers on board the four-person crew were also revealed this morning.

    "content": "More details are beginning to emerge on Houston-based Axiom Space’s ambitious project to build and operate the world’s first commercial space station. Thales Alenia Space, a European aerospace manufacturer, will develop the two pressurized modules of the Axiom Space Station. The two elements, which are scheduled to launch in 2024 and 2025, will dock to the International Space Station before eventually detaching and operating as a fully independent, commercial station. The two companies announced the signing of the final contract, valued at €110 million ($130 million), on Thursday. Each module will be able to accommodate four people. Thales will also be designing the micrometeoroid and debris protection system for each module. The modules are still in their design phase, Thales Alenia said. The company recently completed development of the first module’s four radial bulkheads at its facility in Turin, Italy. The bulkheads, once connected, will form a cylinder. That structure will attach to the common berth mechanisms, parts of the module that will connect to the ISS and hatches. The two modules have a long road ahead of them. Thales Alenia, a joint venture between French company Thales Group and Italian conglomerate Leonardo, will begin welding on the first module this September through to next year. That module will be sent to Axiom’s Texas facilities in July 2023, where Axiom will then integrate the core systems and prepare it for launch in 2024. NASA tapped Axiom to build the first commercial living quarters for the ISS in January 2020. Once the ISS is decommissioned, Axiom’s station will detach and function as a commercial center for future missions and scientific experiments. It’s a major part of NASA’s plans to encourage the growth of the burgeoning low Earth orbit economy and the buildout of other private orbital labs and commercial facilities. Axiom will also operate the first fully private mission to the ISS, scheduled for January 2022. Axiom Mission 1 will send four private astronauts to space onboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon, for an eight-day mission. Axiom Space and NASA detail first fully private human launch to the Space Station, set for January 2022 Despite economic downturn, space startup funding defies gravity Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "content": "Boeing’s Starliner capsule is leaving the launchpad after a series of delays that prevented takeoff over the last few days. NASA and the beleaguered aerospace giant will take “whatever time is necessary” to find and fix the issue, but it’s beginning to feel like this long-in-development spacecraft may never make it to the ISS. This is the second major launch attempt after the Starliner failed to enter the correct orbit in a 2019 launch. The rescheduled ISS rendezvous launch was originally scheduled for March of this year, but eventually delayed to this week. A valve issue prompted a countdown halt yesterday, but the ground teams have been unable to resolve the problem as the whole operation has had to stand down as a result. “Engineering teams have ruled out a number of potential causes, including software, but additional time is needed to complete the assessment,” wrote NASA in a news release. “Mission teams have decided to roll the Atlas V and Starliner back to the Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) for further inspection and testing where access to the spacecraft is available. Boeing will power down the Starliner spacecraft this evening.” It’s another major setback for Boeing’s shot at providing crew launch capability, something its rival SpaceX has achieved now multiple times despite originally working on a very similar timeline. Both experienced years of delays, but ultimately Crew Dragon was successfully piloted to the ISS while Starliner has yet to make a successful orbital trip at all, let alone one with astronauts on board. ‘This is certainly different’: Astronauts on controlling the Dragon spacecraft via touchscreen Some may wonder whether this is throwing good money after bad, since the race is apparently lost. But Boeing knows better than many that this is a marathon, not a sprint, and that the demand for orbital launches is nearly insatiable. Even if SpaceX has a multiyear lead on Boeing, Boeing has a multiyear lead on some of its other competitors and if it can get Starliner working there will likely be enough customers to make even its tortuous development worthwhile. Depending on how quickly this valve issue is resolved, it could be weeks or months before there’s another launch attempt. Devin Coldewey is a Seattle-based writer and photographer.

    "content": "Sales of Tesla’s Cybertruck have plummeted from their peak last year, to the point that the hulking (and expensive) GMC Hummer EV outsold the polarizing steel-clad curiosity in the second quarter. Tesla sold just 4,306 Cybertrucks in the second quarter, just shy of the 4,508 Hummers that GMC moved in the same period, according to new data from Cox Automotive. Both were beat by Ford’s F-150 Lightning, which once again became the best-selling electric truck in the U.S. in the first quarter, beating out the Cybertruck. But even Ford’s offering is struggling; the 5,842 Lightnings sold in Q2 was the lowest quarterly total for the company in over a year. To be fair, the GMC Hummer tally includes sales of both the pickup truck and its SUV variant, although there is very little that differentiates the two. Put another way, the SUV version of the Hummer EV still more closely resembles a truck than it does a typical sport utility vehicle. Rivian has also been struggling with its own electric truck, the R1T. The company sold just 1,752 of them last quarter, down from 3,309 in the same period last year. But the Cybertruck has had the biggest fall from grace by far. After handing over the first few units in December 2023, the company started selling them in earnest in early 2024. Sales shot up to a high of nearly 17,000 in the third quarter of 2024, but fell just as quickly, as seen in the chart above. Whether that fall was due to the brand damage wrought by Elon Musk and his involvement with the Trump administration, or the fact that the Cybertruck is still far more expensive than the $40,000 price tag Tesla promised when it revealed the EV in 2019, is difficult to say. The company, at one point, predicted it would be making as many as 250,000 Cybertrucks a year, and now has a tremendous amount of unused capacity at its Texas factory as a result. As Musk once said about the shiny EV: “We dug our own grave with Cybertruck.” Sean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "content": "Tesla’s flailing sales figures have put the company closer to the red than it has been in years, according to financial results released Tuesday, threatening one of its biggest advantages over other EV players. The electric automaker reported $409 million in net income on $19.3 billion in revenue after delivering almost 337,000 EVs in the first quarter of the year. The company’s net income reflects a 71% drop from the same quarter last year. It was the worst quarter for Tesla deliveries in more than two years and came on the heels of the company’s first-ever year-to-year drop in sales. Tesla’s income was buffered by selling $595 million in zero-emissions tax credits, according to its earnings report — without those, it would have posted a loss. And yet, Tesla stock rose in after-hours trading as investors put more weight on the company’s plans to begin production on an affordable EV in June and CEO Elon Musk’s comments during an earnings call that he would reduce his role with the Department of Government Efficiency to focus more attention on Tesla. Musk did not commit to ending his DOGE work altogether though, noting he may continue in some capacity through the remainder of President Donald Trump’s second term. TechCrunch published a roundup of other Musk comments covering tariffs, robotaxis, AI, and EVs, during Tesla’s earnings call. Tesla also cautioned shareholders about how the trade war may affect its business moving forward. The company said President Trump’s tariffs and “changing political sentiment” could have a “meaningful impact on demand for our products.” The company noted the current tariffs, the bulk of which are directed at China, will have “a relatively larger impact on our Energy business compared to automotive.” Tesla said it is taking actions to stabilize the business in the medium to long term and focus on maintaining its health, but it also cautioned investors that it can’t say whether it will be able to grow sales this year. Tesla is sticking to its ambitious (but mysterious) plans around making more affordable models, stating it remains on track for start of production of these vehicles in the first half of 2025. During the earnings call, Musk was more specific, stating production would begin in June. These vehicles will use aspects of a next-generation platform that powers the robotaxi, but will rely on its existing one that powers the Model Y and Model 3, the company said in its shareholder’s letter. As such, these cheaper vehicles will be produced on the same manufacturing lines as the current vehicle lineup, the company said. This flies in the face of a Reuters report from last week that claimed the first of these new EVs is delayed by months. Tesla’s sales are up against a number of headwinds. The company’s EV lineup is aging (though the sedans and SUVs have now all gotten face-lifts) and its newest product, the Cybertruck, is nowhere near the hit that CEO Elon Musk thought it could be. And Musk’s far-right politics, along with his involvement in the Trump administration, have created a sizable backlash to Tesla’s brand. At the same time, Musk has oriented the company toward its Robotaxi and Optimus robot projects. He has promised to launch an initial version of the Robotaxi service in Austin this June, with other cities potentially coming by the end of this year, but has been light on details about how it will work. Musk has yet to demonstrate that Teslas are capable of driving themselves without human intervention despite years of making that promise. What’s more, The Information recently reported that an internal analysis done at Tesla showed the Robotaxi program would lose money for a long period of time even if it were to work. At this time last year, Tesla was grappling with some gloomy numbers. In case you forgot, the company’s profits fell 55% to $1.13 billion in the first quarter of 2024 from the same period in 2023. Tesla said it was due to a protracted EV price-cutting strategy and “several unforeseen challenges” cut into the automaker’s bottom line. Tesla tried to turn that profit ship around, but faced continued pressure. In Q2 of 2024, Tesla reported $1.5 billion in profit, down 45% from the same period in 2023. Profits were hit by a $622 million restructuring charge. Although it’s worth noting, that profit was padded by a record $890 million in regulatory credit sales.This article originally published at 1:15 pm PT.

    "content": "Tesla has announced that its redesigned Model Y SUV is coming to the U.S., Canada, and Mexico in March, with a starting price just shy of $60,000. The news comes just two weeks after Tesla revealed the new-look Model Y and said the SUV was coming to China and other Asian markets, also in March. Thursday’s announcement means the company is effectively launching the revamped SUV simultaneously around the globe — a departure from the multiple-month gap between the Asian and North American launch of the Model 3 sedan refresh in late 2023 and early 2024. The redesigned Model Y is being launched at a crucial time for Tesla, which delivered fewer vehicles in 2024 than it did in 2023. Tesla has repeatedly warned investors that it is in between “two major growth waves” coming off the success of the Model Y and promised that it will roll out mysterious new models meant to be built on existing production lines. Those models will likely be cheaper than Tesla’s current offerings (which start in the low $40,000 range), but it’s not clear by how much. CEO Elon Musk has implied those new models, plus the Cybercab that was teased last October, will help bridge the company’s evolution from an automaker into a robotics and AI player. But at the same time, Tesla’s vehicle lineup has been aging. Tesla has now refreshed each of its core vehicles — the Model S and 3 sedans and the Model X and Y SUVs. It has only launched one truly new model in the last four years, the Cybertruck. While it became the best-selling electric truck in the U.S. in 2024, the Cybertruck did little to boost the company’s bottom line last year, and it does not seem to be the runaway hit Musk had hoped for. The new-look Model Y could offer some relief, although it is coming in at a higher price point than the existing versions. The starting price for the “Launch Series” special edition, which is an all-wheel-drive variant, is $59,990. That gets buyers a 320-mile range battery and it includes Tesla’s most advanced driver-assistance software, which it calls “Full Self-Driving (Supervised)” — typically an $8,000 option. The older Model Y currently starts at $44,990 for a 337-mile rear-wheel drive version. The most noticeable changes to the new Model Y come on the exterior, where the bubbly front fascia has been ditched in favor of a more cinched nose with a thin light bar that stretches across the hood. The rear of the vehicle also now has a light strip that stretches the full width. Inside the refreshed SUV, Tesla has added a configurable light strip that rims the cabin. There’s a new rear-passenger touchscreen and some quality-of-life upgrades like powered rear seats and improved suspension.

    "content": "Tesla just turned in one of its more disappointing first quarters for deliveries in a while, and the company is putting some of the blame on an arson attack at its factory in Germany and shipping disruptions caused by Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. Tesla said Tuesday that it delivered 386,810 vehicles in the first quarter of 2024, down 20% from the 484,507 it delivered in the final quarter of 2023. Crucially, Tesla shipped fewer cars than it did in the first quarter of 2023, meaning this was the first year-over-year drop in sales in three years. Production was also down year-over-year, which Tesla attributed to switching to making the new Model 3, as well as the other disruptions. The arson attack shut down the Germany factory for nearly a week, and Tesla suspended production there for two weeks in January due to the problems in the Red Sea. The company’s stock fell more than 6% in early trading. These drops come just two months after Tesla warned that sales growth could be “notably lower” in 2024 as it comes off a successful 2023 fueled by price cuts. The company claimed in January that it is “between two major growth waves” as it tries to ramp up production of the Cybertruck. It also has a lower-cost EV in the works, though plans for that have already shifted, and the company has said it is trying to create an all-new manufacturing process to get costs lower. The company is facing increasing competition in China, too, where companies big and small are flooding the market with low-cost EVs. Bloomberg News reported last month that Tesla curtailed output at its Shanghai factory as a result of slower sales growth in the country. Tesla tried to pull a few tricks at the end of the quarter to boost sales, as it usually does. The company promoted a one-month free trial of its advanced driver assistance software (which it calls Full Self-Driving, even though it does not make the cars autonomous). It also teased through much of March that it was hiking prices starting April 1. This story has been updated to include more information about Tesla’s factory shutdowns.

    "content": "Update: Tesla’s We, Robot event has concluded, but there’s still plenty to catch up on. The Cybercab, which Tesla is pitching as the future of autonomous transport, was revealed to be a two-seater that could be purchased for less than $30,000. Then, in a surprise reveal, CEO Elon Musk showed off the larger Robovan for transporting up to 20 people. And Anthony Levandowski, who co-founded Google’s self-driving car program, broadly supported Musk’s visions in a post-event interview. Check out the full archive of the event below, which is set to skip the 53 minutes of techno that preempted the actual event, or go back and follow along with our live blog from Thursday. Tesla loves to put on a show, and Thursday’s Robotaxi reveal might just be the flashiest of them all. The electric vehicle maker is slated to unveil its much-hyped Robotaxi vehicle at Warner Bros. Discovery’s movie studio in Burbank, California. For those attending, doors will open at 5 p.m. PT, with remarks beginning at 7 p.m. PT today. Tesla will livestream the “We, Robot” event on X, which Musk owns, and on the automaker’s usually streams events live on its YouTube page. The YouTube backup is a smart option, considering the technical issues X’s livestreams have faced. And you can follow along with our own live blog of the event here. Musk first teased the Robotaxi event in April, setting a date of August 8 for a reveal — a date that Tesla had to push back due to “an important design change to the front.” The Robotaxi appears to have come at the expense of a next-generation $25,000 EV that Musk also promised. A few weeks after Musk announced the Robotaxi event, he slashed more than 10% of Tesla’s workforce and said the automaker was going “balls to the wall for autonomy.” Musk has promised autonomous capabilities in Tesla vehicles for years. The company’s advanced driver-assistance system is rather brazenly named Full Self-Driving (FSD), even though it is not fully self-driving and requires a human driver to pay attention and take over if needed — a fact that is borne out again and again in drive-along videos that fans regularly post on social media. When Musk first floated the idea of robotaxis in 2019, the idea was that some existing Teslas would be able to act as autonomous robotaxis with only software updates, potentially unlocking an opportunity for Tesla owners to make money from their cars when not driving them. That plan, which was supposed to result in millions of robotaxis on the road by 2020, has never been implemented. At the time, Musk said that in places where there aren’t enough people to share their cars, Tesla would provide a dedicated fleet of robotaxis. We expect this reveal — which we remind you is at a Hollywood studio — to be less about the autonomous technology and more about the vehicle itself. Musk has said he wants to build a robotaxi without a steering wheel or pedals, and images of the vehicle that were included in Walter Isaacson’s Elon Musk biography, which was published in 2023, reveal a Cybertruck-inspired, two-door, two-seater compact vehicle. Whatever the event brings, TechCrunch will be following it live and bringing you the news as it happens, so stay tuned. This post has been updated following the conclusion of Tesla’s We, Robot event.

    "content": "Elon Musk unveiled a prototype of Tesla’s Robovan on Thursday night during the company’s We, Robot event in Los Angeles. The Robovan will be an electric, autonomous vehicle roughly the size of a bus, designed for transporting people around high density areas. It will carry up to 20 people at a time and also transport goods, according to Musk. “We’re going to make this, and it’s going to look like that,” said Musk on Thursday night as the Robovan rolled towards center stage. That’s about as much as Musk was willing to say, and we’re not even sure that much is true. Musk didn’t mention how much the Robovan would cost, how Tesla would produce it, or when it will come out. However, it does look pretty cool. The Robovan has a retro-futuristic look – somewhere between a bus from The Jetsons and a toaster from the 1950s. It features silver metallic sides with black details, and strips of light running parallel to the ground along its sides, with doors that slide out from the middle. Inside, there are seats and room to stand, with tinted windows throughout. There is no steering wheel, since it’s autonomous. “One of the things we want to do – and we’ve done this with the Cybertruck – is we want to change the look of the roads,” said Musk. “The future should look like the future,” he said, repeating an old line. It looks similar to other purpose-built robotaxis, like those designed by Zoox and Cruise. Only Tesla’s van is much bigger. In China, WeRide has built a similar Robobus. That said, the Robovan showed on Thursday is only a prototype. Despite what Musk says, there’s no telling what the real thing will look like or when it will actually come out. Tesla had kept the design of the vehicles it introduced on Thursday pretty close to the chest. The only real hint we had was from Tesla’s 2023 Investor Day, when the automaker teased a couple of new vehicles that appeared to be designed for volume production: One smaller vehicle that appears now to be the Cybercab, and a larger one that we can now say is likely the Robovan. The stated goal at the time was to produce 20 million vehicles per year by 2030. That would mean that Tesla needs to increase production and sales by about 15 times from 2022. During Thursday’s event, Musk did not outline any plans for building new production facilities or retooling existing facilities to accommodate either the Cybercab or the Robovan. He also didn’t provide much in the way of timelines for the Robovan, though he predicted the Cybercab would start production in 2026 or 2027. Tesla CEO Elon Musk first floated the idea of launching a robotaxi network using autonomous Teslas in 2019, saying he… Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "content": "Elon Musk says he will show off Tesla’s purpose-built “robotaxi” prototype during an event October 10, after scrapping a previous plan to reveal it August 8. Musk said Tesla will also show off “a couple of other things,” but didn’t explain what that meant. The comments, made on Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call Tuesday, largely confirms Bloomberg’s original report about the delay, including that it was driven by Musk’s desire to redesign certain elements of the prototype. Musk confirmed earlier this month that he requested an “important design change to the front.” “Moving it back a few months allowed us to improve the robotaxi, as well as add in a couple other things for the product unveil,” Musk said during the call. The Tesla robotaxi — and the “unsupervised” full self-driving software that Musk says will run them — is at the center of the company’s future. Earlier this year, he laid off more than 10% of Tesla’s global staff in a bid to reorganize the company toward developing artificial intelligence-powered products, including a “balls to the wall” push toward developing autonomy. That AI-focused future is bumping up against the company’s primary profit center of selling EVs, though. Tesla reported Tuesday that it made $1.5 billion in profit for the second quarter of 2024, down 45% from the same period last year. That profit was padded by a record $890 million in regulatory credit sales, too, though Tesla reported a $622 million restructuring charge that dragged down its earnings. And while total revenues were up 2% year-over-year, automotive revenues dropped 7% to $19.9 billion. This performance follows what was already a rough start to the year for Tesla, where it saw a 55% year-over-year drop in profit in the first quarter. The company is now looking at a real possibility of selling fewer EVs in 2024 than it did in 2023, which would represent a stunning reversal of its prior growth trajectory. Tesla has massaged this by telling investors that it is between “two major growth waves,” pinning hopes of more sales on the new (but polarizing and expensive) Cybertruck, and mysterious future models that could be sold at a lower MSRP. That’s all “in the noise,” though, according to Musk. Tesla’s long-term value lies in autonomy and autonomy alone, he stressed on Tuesday’s call. That includes the company’s humanoid robot effort, dubbed Optimus, which got a sneaky delay this week. But it mostly centers around Musk’s longest running promise that he has yet to deliver on: self-driving cars. With that in mind, Musk tried to focus investors’ attention to the October 10 event. Not much is publicly known about what Tesla will show off, though there was an illustration of a small robotaxi prototype in the biography of Musk written by Walter Isaacson in 2023. Musk has spoken about making the vehicle available to people through Tesla’s app, similar to how Uber and Lyft operate. He’s also claimed Tesla owners will be able to put their own cars on the shared network once the company makes its Full Self-Driving software advanced enough to handle all driving — something it is still far from accomplishing, despite the name. Despite years of promises, Musk has struggled to execute on the idea of fully self-driving cars, and as a result Tesla is being sued by owners and investigated by numerous government agencies. Asked on the call when Tesla would be able to offer its first unsupervised robotaxi ride, Musk said he believes it could be possible by the end of this year. But he added that it also could happen in 2025, and that he is “overly optimistic” with his predictions. This story has been updated with more details from Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call.

    "content": "One of SpaceX’s Starship rockets exploded on a test stand in Texas late on Wednesday night, as the company prepared for the tenth test flight of the heavy-lift rocket system. SpaceX said “all personnel are safe and accounted for” in a post on X, and claimed there are “no hazards to residents in surrounding communities.” The company said in a later update on Thursday that an initial analysis suggests the explosion was caused by a failure of a “pressurized tank known as a COPV, or composite overwrapped pressure vessel” in the Starship’s nosecone. The enormous explosion caused damage to the area surrounding the test stand, according to SpaceX. But the company said there are no reported injuries. SpaceX was preparing to perform a “static fire” of the Starship’s six Raptor engines, and so the area around the rocket had been cleared prior to the explosion. It’s not immediately clear what impact this will have on SpaceX’s development of the Starship rocket system. A recent advisory from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) suggested the tenth test flight could have happened as soon as June 29. That will most likely be delayed as the company works through what went wrong on Wednesday night. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said in a post seemingly related to the explosion that he considers it to be: “Just a scratch.” ANOMALY! Just before Ship 36 was set to Static Fire, it blew up at SpaceX Masseys!Live on X and YT:https://t.co/GPjZIX1Zyd pic.twitter.com/CfZhDeSGae SpaceX has spent the last few years aggressively developing the 171-foot Starship and the massive 232-foot Super Heavy booster that powers it into space. The company started 2025 saying this year would be a “transformational” one for the program, and the FAA recently increased its limit on Starship launches in Texas from five to 25. But Starship, in particular, has had a number of problems this year. The rocket unexpectedly exploded during its seventh test flight in January, and then again in March. It failed again during its ninth test in May. While the rocket made it further into its most recent flight in May than during the previous two tests, it still failed to deploy the dummy Starlink satellites it was carrying onboard — a crucial step in the company’s plan to use the mega-rocket to grow its space-based internet service. Musk has maintained that SpaceX is on track to try to send a Starship to Mars in 2026, giving it a “50/50” chance in a company update in May. The company is also developing a larger “Version 3” of Starship that, Musk claimed, could fly as early as this year.

    "content": "SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket lifted off on its 10th test flight Tuesday evening, hitting two long-sought milestones and putting an end to a string of failures. The 403-foot vehicle lifted off from Starbase, SpaceX’s launch facility and recently incorporated city, at 7:30 p.m. ET after two scrubs earlier this week. The rocket ascended on 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines before separating around three minutes after liftoff. On descent, the Super Heavy booster tested out a new maneuver: intentionally shutting down the engines used for landing and transitioning to backup engines. The test will help engineers understand how the booster might perform in the case of failure. The test appeared to go as planned, with the 232-foot-tall booster successfully making a targeted splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. Meanwhile, the upper stage, also called Starship, reached space. There, for the first time on a Starship flight, it opened its Pez-style payload door and released eight Starlink mass-simular satellites. This is a capability that SpaceX had planned but failed to demonstrate on earlier missions. The company also successfully relit one of the Raptor engines in space before guiding the vehicle toward the Indian Ocean, where it splashed down, tipped over, and promptly exploded. On the way down, the exterior of the ship was exposed to incredible heat during atmospheric reentry, providing an excellent test environment for the upgraded thermal-protection system. SpaceX also used this test to try out a series of experiments, like removing tiles from sections of the ship to see how its “skin” operates on reentry, plus a new metallic tile and an actively cooled tile. Most importantly, however, is the upper stage completed the entire test and splashed down in the Indian Ocean without losing comms with SpaceX engineers. During the last flight, the ship reached space and then lost attitude control during the coast phase, preventing the payload doors from opening. Engineers appear to have overcome those issues. It’s a big win for SpaceX, which has repeatedly lost the Starship upper stage due to a series of technical failures during flight. The persistent issues have raised questions as to whether the rocket will be ready to land humans on the moon by mid-2027 for NASA, or when it will be capable of deploying next-gen Starlink satellites for the company. This test marks a material advancement for the Starship program, which the company wants to eventually use to send humans and cargo to Mars. While SpaceX still has to complete a series of tough technical milestones before it can get there, it got one step closer tonight.

    "content": "Watch Starship’s second integrated flight test → https://t.co/bJFjLCiTbK https://t.co/cahoRQ72lm — SpaceX (@SpaceX) November 18, 2023 SpaceX flew Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built, for the second time today — and even though both the Super Heavy booster and the Starship upper stage had to be blown up in midair, it was still a huge success for the company best known for taking a rapidly iterative approach to hardware development. The rocket lifted off at 7:03 a.m. CST from SpaceX’s massive Starship development and launch facilities near Boca Chica, Texas. At liftoff, all 33 Raptor engines on the Super Heavy booster were lit and none went out during the mission, which is a huge improvement from the first launch, which lost around six engines between lift-off and flight. The launch infrastructure, including the orbital launch mount that the vehicle sits on prior to lift-off, also seemed to have fared better this time around. This suggests that the new water deluge system, which floods the launch area with water at engine ignition, seemed to have successfully protected the infrastructure. (During the first launch, the power of the Raptor engines igniting sent huge chunks of concrete and dust into the air, effectively destroying the orbital launch mount.) The other major win came during stage separation. The first Starship orbital flight test didn’t get this far. But the second time around, using a novel stage separation technique known as “hot staging,” where Starship’s engines actually ignite to push the Booster away, SpaceX managed to pull it off. Shortly after this point, the automated flight termination system (FTS) onboard the Super Heavy booster was triggered, leading to a “rapid unscheduled disassembly” — in other words, it was blown up. It is not clear why this occurred, though SpaceX hosts on the company’s live launch webcast said the team will be able to use the data from the moments post-hot staging and pre-explosion to better understand the booster’s performance. This same fate eventually came to the Starship upper stage. Before second engine cutoff, when Starship would’ve powered down its six engines and continued its ascent, SpaceX hosts announced that they had lost data from the second stage. The hosts then said that the automated FTS was activated — though again, it’s unclear why. The mission concluded around seven minutes after lift-off. No people or payload were onboard the vehicle. The eventual aim during a flight test is for Starship to successfully complete engine cutoff, glide more than halfway around Earth and splash down in the Pacific Ocean. “An incredibly successful day, even though we did have a ‘rapid unscheduled disassembly’ both of the Super Heavy booster and the ship,” SpaceX’s senior quality systems engineering manager Kate Tice said on the webcast. Standing at 397 feet tall and around 30 meters in diameter, Starship is the largest rocket humanity has ever built. To put things in perspective, Super Heavy’s 33 Raptor engines produce 16.7 million pounds of thrust — many times more than the 1.7 million pounds of thrust of Falcon 9, SpaceX’s workhorse rocket. At this point, getting Starship operational is key to SpaceX’s mission. In the nearer term, that mission is being able to launch many, many dozens of heavier Starlink satellites at once; in the longer term, that’s using the cash flow from the improved Starlink constellation to fund a mission to Mars. But SpaceX is not the only entity banking on Starship’s success. NASA has also pegged itself to SpaceX’s ship, awarding the company contracts topping out at around $4 billion to develop a lunar landing system using Starship to bring astronauts to the moon for the space agency’s Artemis program. That first landing mission, Artemis III, is currently slated for 2025. Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "content": "SpaceX said Monday that last month’s Starship explosion was brought on by a cascading series of events caused by propellant leaks — a problem the company says has been addressed ahead of an eighth test flight that could happen as early as Friday. The spaceflight company is still waiting for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to either officially close the “mishap investigation” into the explosion, or specially authorize SpaceX to perform the flight while the investigation continues. This is, notably, the first time SpaceX has been subjected to a mishap investigation while CEO Elon Musk is operating inside the United States government, with workers from his so-called Department of Government Efficiency actively making changes at the FAA. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. SpaceX’s January test of Starship started off fine enough. The company was hoping to test out a number of upgrades to the Super Heavy booster, the launch-and-catch tower, and on Starship itself. The heavy-lift rocket system launched without any problem and headed off to space, with the booster eventually separating and coming back down to the ground in Texas where it was caught by the tower. The problems started about two minutes after Starship ignited its own rocket engines to get to orbit. The company wrote in a blog post that “a flash was observed in the aft section of the vehicle near one of the Raptor vacuum engines.” Sensors onboard the ship started picking up a rise in pressure after the flash “indicative of a leak” of propellant, according to SpaceX. Another flash was seen two minutes later, and SpaceX says “sustained fires” began in that section of Starship due to the leaks. The fires caused “all but one of Starship’s engines to execute controlled shut down sequences and ultimately led to a loss of communication with the ship.” SpaceX says the leaks were most likely caused by vibrations that exceeded what the company expected from testing, “which led to increased stress on hardware in the propulsion system.” The automatic in-flight abort system eventually triggered the destruction of the ship following the fires and communications blackout. That explosion led to a spectacular display over the islands of Turks and Caicos, and also resulted in the FAA diverting a number of flights to avoid any danger. SpaceX claims that all of the Starship debris “came down within the pre-planned Debris Response Area” — a sort of safe-zone that it typically negotiates ahead of flights with government agencies. Residents have been posting photos of debris washing up on beaches and at least one vehicle was struck, receiving minor damage. SpaceX says it has made changes to the lines that send fuel to Starship’s engines, tweaked the temperature of the propellant, and has added extra vents and “a new purge system” to make the aft section in question “more robust to propellant leakage.” Sean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "content": "As regulators weigh SpaceX’s plans to launch its massive Starship rocket from Kennedy Space Center, federal documents warn those flights could ripple through Florida airspace, forcing ground stops at multiple airports, reroutes, and delays of up to two hours. Even after launch, reentry of Starship’s two stages could require ground stops at some of the busiest airports in the country, according to a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) released by the Federal Aviation Administration this month. Florida airports affected by the launches may include Orlando International, Miami International, Tampa International, and Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International. Average delays could be as long as 40 minutes to 2 hours for launches and Super Heavy booster landings, and 40 minutes to one hour for Starship reentries. Diversions and cancellations are possible, the FAA said in a companion slide deck. To manage risk, the FAA would establish Aircraft Hazard Areas (AHAs) over potentially impacted zones, as it does for commercial space launches today. Depending on the Starship flight trajectory, those zones could overlay routes above the Atlantic, parts of the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and airspace in several Central American countries. “AHAs may necessitate the closure of dozens of coastal and deep-water oceanic airways over the Atlantic Ocean, requiring substantial aircraft rerouting to avoid the AHAs,” the draft EIS says regarding Starship launches. Tampa International Airport spokesperson Emily Nipps told TechCrunch the airport has not been involved in any briefings or procedural planning with the FAA or SpaceX, so far. However, a day after TechCrunch sent its inquiries to the relevant airports and the FAA, Nipps said the airport was informed it would be having those discussions “soon.” “Whether that changes anything for us operationally, I don’t yet know,” she said. A spokesperson for Miami International said they have not received any briefings on possible ground stops. SpaceX has been launching its flagship Falcon rockets from the Florida coast for years, and that cadence has sharply increased since 2020. Despite launching over 80 Falcon rockets from the Eastern Range last year, these launches don’t typically interrupt commercial airlines. But the Falcon rockets are substantially different from Starship: Falcon’s smaller size means a smaller possible footprint for debris in the case of an anomaly, and the Falcon launches are at this point predictable and mature. Starship is in a much earlier stage of development, with vehicles still occasionally blowing up during both ground tests and orbital flights. Indeed, the draft EIS notes that the size of airspace closures may vary with each Starship mission, and that it could shrink as the vehicle becomes more reliable. An FAA spokesperson said the agency has already engaged with aviation organizations, and worked with SpaceX to develop notional launch and reentry trajectories. Prior to launch, the agency will also distribute a final Airspace Management Plan. The FAA relies on a number of factors, including the number of affected passengers, launch window duration, and major holidays when determining when a space launch can proceed, the spokesperson added. Starship is SpaceX’s next-generation launch system designed for travel to the moon and Mars. The 400-foot-tall rocket is composed of two stages: an upper stage, also called Starship, and a Super Heavy booster. Both stages are designed to be fully reusable and rapidly refurbished for high-cadence satellite delivery and missions to deep space. Today, SpaceX conducts all Starship launch activities from Starbase in south Texas. But the company is looking to expand operations to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, prompting the environmental review. That review is conducted by the FAA in cooperation with NASA, the Air Force, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and other federal agencies. The draft EIS analyzes up to 44 Starship launches per year, which could include up to 44 Super Heavy booster landings and 44 Starship landings. Super Heavy could land back at LC-39A, the launch pad at KSC, on a droneship, or be expended in the Atlantic. Starship landings could likewise occur at the pad, on a ship, or as water splashdowns with recovery in the Atlantic, Pacific, or Indian Oceans. The FAA said in the draft EIS that while temporary airspace closures may impact commercial airlines and other stakeholders, “mitigation strategies such as pre-coordinated reroutes, dynamic scheduling, and time-based traffic flow management could reduce operational burdens.” Today, the FAA uses a prototype tool called Space Data Integrator, which ingests real-time flight data from SpaceX and other operators to shrink the amount of time airspace is closed. The regulator says it wants to develop more tools to beef up its situational awareness capability, and each time Starship launches it will get more data on its operations. The U.S. Space Force is running a parallel environmental review at neighboring Cape Canaveral Space Force Base that analyzes up to 76 annual Starship launches. While the draft EIS for that site states Starship launches would result in airspace closures, it says details of the closures are not yet known because the site is expected to take months to prepare.

    "content": "For the first time, SpaceX not only launched its mammoth Starship, but also returned the booster to the launch site and caught it with a pair of oversized “chopsticks.” This test flight — the fifth in the Starship development program — took place Sunday morning at the company’s Starbase site in southeast Texas. The nearly 400-foot-tall Starship is at the centerpiece of SpaceX’s stated ambition to make life multi-planetary, but more immediately NASA’s ambitious Artemis campaign to return humans to the surface of the moon. SpaceX envisions rapid reuse of the entire Starship vehicle, which includes an upper stage (also called Starship) and a Super Heavy booster — but that means proving out the capability to recover both stages and quickly refurbish them for future flights. So it makes sense that the primary objectives for this fifth flight test were two-fold: attempting the first-ever “catch” of the Super Heavy booster at the launch site and an on-target Starship reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The latter goal had already been achieved: SpaceX nailed a controlled reentry and splashdown of the Starship upper stage during the last test mission in June. But the booster catch, as the company put it in a blog post, would be “singularly novel” in the history of rocketry. The closest analogue is the now-routine Falcon 9 booster landings on autonomous barges and terrestrial landing zones. In today’s launch, the booster slowed to a hover and gently positioned itself inside the zone of two “chopstick” arms attached to the launch tower. Those arms then closed around the booster and held it up after its engines stop firing. You can see the catch at around 40 minutes into SpaceX’s video of the test. Following the booster detachment and catch, Starship continued to ascend into orbit before splashing in the Indian Ocean and exploding (SpaceX had not planned to recover the spacecraft). SpaceX noted in an update posted on its website that “thousands” of criteria showing healthy systems across the vehicle and pad had to be met for the catch attempt to occur. This test also took place a little sooner than expected: The Federal Aviation Administration had previously said that it did not anticipate issuing a modified launch license for this test before late November. That timeline gave much umbrage to SpaceX, leading the company to repeatedly call out what it characterized as the regulator’s inefficiency. But the FAA announced on Saturday that it had approved the launch. “The FAA determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental and other licensing requirements for the suborbital test flight,” the regulator said in a statement. Notably, the authorization also includes approval for the next test flight, given that “the changes requested by SpaceX for Flight 6 are within the scope of what has been previously analyzed,” the FAA said. While awaiting this launch license, SpaceX engineers have stayed very busy: In recent months, they have conducted numerous tests on the launch tower, completely replaced the rocket’s entire thermal protection system with newer tiles and a backup ablative layer, and updated the ship’s software for reentry. This week, engineers completed propellant loading tests and testing of the launch pad’s water deluge system, which is meant to protect the pad from the powerful fire of the booster’s 33 Raptor engines. The company eventually plans on bringing the Starship upper stage back to the landing site too, though we’ll have to wait to see that in future test launches. “With each flight building on the learnings from the last, testing improvements in hardware and operations across every facet of Starship, we’re on the verge of demonstrating techniques fundamental to Starship’s fully and rapidly reusable design,” the company says. “By continuing to push our hardware in a flight environment, and doing so as safely and frequently as possible, we’ll rapidly bring Starship online and revolutionize humanity’s ability to access space.” Anthony Ha contributed to this report, which has been updated to reflect the successful test flight.

    "content": "The Federal Aviation Administration has concluded its review of SpaceX’s investigation of the second Starship launch in November, with the regulator saying Monday that it accepted the “root causes and 17 corrective actions” identified by the company. While this means the investigation is now closed, SpaceX must implement all the corrective actions and apply for a modified launch license before it can fly Starship again. “The FAA is evaluating SpaceX’s license modification request and expects SpaceX to submit additional required information before a final determination can be made,” the regulator said in a statement Monday. SpaceX’s second orbital flight test of the nearly 400-foot-tall Starship rocket in November went farther than the first test by a huge margin: all 33 of the Raptor engines on the Super Heavy booster powered on successfully and none failed in the course of the nearly three-minute ascent burn. The company also pulled off a spectacularly difficult “hot-stage separation” for the first time, wherein the Starship upper stage lit up to push away from the booster. But like the first test, which occurred last April, it ended in a fiery explosion mid-air. When any rocket launch encounters catastrophic issues during flight, the FAA opens what’s known as a “mishap investigation” — that’s what’s happened here. These are led by the company and reviewed by regulators, who must sign off on the analysis and ensure the corrective actions are actually implemented. After the first test, the FAA directed SpaceX to complete 63 corrective actions. Per the FAA, the company ultimately identified seven changes to the booster and 10 to the Starship vehicle: “Seven booster corrective actions were identified, including redesigns of vehicle hardware to increase tank filtration and reduce slosh, updated thrust vector control system modelling, reevaluation of engine analyses based on OFT-2 data, and updated engine control algorithms. Ten Starship corrective actions were identified, including hardware redesigns to increase robustness and reduce complexity, hardware changes to reduce leaks, operational changes eliminating pre-second engine cutoff propellant dumps, flammability analysis updates, installation of additional fire protection, creation of analytical guidance, performance of transient load analysis, and modeling updates.” In an update also published Monday, SpaceX demystified some of these corrective actions in a rare post-launch postmortem, with the company noting that the likely root cause of the booster’s “rapid unscheduled disassembly” — aerospace lingo for “explosion” — was a filter blockage in one of the Raptor engines. This engine failed “energetically,” the company said, which led to a total loss of the booster. The Starship upper stage met its own end around seven minutes into the flight, when a propellant leak started a fire that severed communication between the spacecraft’s onboard computers. This led to an engine shutdown, which then triggered the autonomous flight termination system to destroy the vehicle. Some of these hardware changes and design upgrades have already been introduced to the versions of the vehicle that will fly for the third orbital flight test, SpaceX said in the update. Company CEO Elon Musk said during a conversation on his social media platform, X, that mission could take place as soon as the second week of March. “More Starships are ready to fly, putting flight hardware in a flight environment to learn as quickly as possible. Recursive improvement is essential as we work to build a fully reusable launch system capable of carrying satellites, payloads, crew, and cargo to a variety of orbits and Earth, lunar, or Martian landing sites,” SpaceX said in the update. Ultimately, SpaceX is aiming to complete the full mission profile, which includes the Super Heavy booster completing a “boost back burn” and executing a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. Starship would then fly halfway around the world and land in the Pacific Ocean. Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "content": "SpaceX employees are more likely to be injured while working at Starbase than any of its other manufacturing facilities, according to company worker safety records reviewed by TechCrunch. Starbase, a sprawling launch-and-manufacturing site that recently incorporated as its own Texas city, logged injury rates that were almost 6x higher than the average for comparable space vehicle-manufacturing outfits and nearly 3x higher than aerospace manufacturing as a whole in 2024, according to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) data released in May. That outsized injury rate has persisted since 2019, when SpaceX began sharing Starbase injury data with the federal regulator. Starbase is home to SpaceX’s most ambitious program: a fully reusable, ultra-heavy-lift rocket called Starship. The company has been moving at a breakneck pace to bring Starship online to launch Starlink internet satellites and other payloads. Since Starship’s first orbital test in April 2023, SpaceX has attempted eight additional integrated flights. During three of those tests, the company made history by catching the massive Super Heavy booster with “chopstick” arms attached to the launch tower. The data suggests that SpaceX’s rapid progress comes at a cost. And while injury rates alone don’t provide a complete picture of the safety culture at Starbase, they do offer a rare glimpse into the working conditions of the world’s leading space company. OSHA uses a standardized safety metric called Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) to measure a company’s safety record and compare it to industry peers, like Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance. The publicly available data has limitations. It doesn’t distinguish between minor injuries like stitches versus serious incidents such as amputations. TechCrunch calculated the TRIR based on that data, which includes the total number of incidents and total number of hours worked by SpaceX employees at each site. Starbase, which plays a central role in SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s mission to make life multi-planetary, is an outlier in the company and across the industry as a whole. Its TRIR topped out at 4.27 injuries per 100 workers in 2024, when it employed an average of 2,690 workers, according to the data submitted to OSHA. Injured Starbase employees were unable to perform their normal job duties for a total of 3,558 restricted-duty days, plus 656 lost-time days where injuries made them unable to work at all. Starbase is classified by the U.S. government as a space vehicle-manufacturing operation. The injury rate in this sector has fallen dramatically since 1994, dropping from 4.2 injuries per 100 workers to 0.7 injuries per 100 workers in 2023, according to historical data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (BLS calculates these rates through its annual company surveys, which asks for the same information found in OSHA’s worker injury forms.) But despite major changes in safety processes across the industry, Starbase is closer to the rates of 30 years ago. The injury rate across all of SpaceX’s manufacturing facilities — which includes an engine development and testing site in McGregor, Texas; a Starlink satellite-manufacturing complex in Bastrop, Texas; the Falcon rocket complex in Hawthorne, California; and another satellite-manufacturing site in Redmond, Washington — is 2.28. These other facilities report lower TRIR rates, though most still exceed the industry averages. For instance, 2024 data shows TRIR rates of 2.48 at McGregor, 3.49 at Bastrop, 1.43 at Hawthorne, 2.89 at Redmond. The 2024 TRIR for aerospace manufacturing as a whole is 1.6. SpaceX also operates several non-manufacturing sites, including barge operations off both coasts; offices in Sunnyvale, California; and launch sites at Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Space Force Base. Former OSHA chief of staff Debbie Berkowitz told TechCrunch via email that Starbase’s TRIR “is a red flag that there are serious safety issues that need to be addressed.” However, there is a debate among safety professionals about whether TRIR is the most reliable metric for assessing and predicting injury rates, particularly serious incidents like fatalities, and especially for small companies. A recent paper on TRIR questioned its statistical validity and advocated that organizations use alternative measures of safety performance instead. Of the 14 OSHA inspections at SpaceX facilities over the past four years, six involved accidents and injuries at Starbase. That includes a partial finger amputation in 2021 and a crane collapse in June 2025. The latter inspection is still ongoing. Investigations by other news outlets, including Reuters, have uncovered hundreds of previously unreported worker injuries, including crushed limbs and one fatality. The 2024 injury rate at Starbase marks an improvement to that of the prior year, which topped out at 5.9 injuries per 100 workers in 2023 and 4.8 injuries in 2022. But it still leads among SpaceX’s land-based facilities and is second overall only to its West Coast booster recovery operations, which has a TRIR of 7.6. OSHA confirmed TechCrunch’s calculation of Starbase’s TRIR over email, but otherwise did not respond to questions regarding that location’s injury rate. SpaceX did not respond to request for comment. NASA has a major stake in Starship’s development. The agency is counting on using the rocket to return humans to the moon before the end of this decade, and it is paying more than $4 billion to SpaceX for two crewed Starship flights to the lunar surface. Both the contract for the Starship lander and SpaceX’s contract for its Commercial Crew services to the International Space Station contain particular clauses that allow the agency to take action in the case of a major breach of safety, such as a fatality or a “willful” or “repeat” OSHA violation. While a persistently high TRIR rate can be evidence of a safety problem, it is not an automatic trigger for action and does not fall under the definition of a “major breach of safety” in their contracts. “NASA interacts frequently with its partners, including SpaceX, to ensure safety from a mission assurance perspective, and remains in regular contact with the company during normal contract administration,” a NASA spokesperson told TechCrunch in response to questions about the company’s TRIR. “Safety is paramount to NASA’s mission success. The agency continues to work with all our commercial partners to build and maintain a healthy safety culture.” Among rocket makers with vehicles in operation, Starbase still leads the pack: at ULA’s manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama, the TRIR is 1.12 injuries per 100 workers; at Blue Origin’s rocket park on the coast of Florida, the rate is 1.09.

    "content": "This article was originally published at The Conversation. The publication contributed the article to Space.com's Expert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights. For 24 hours a day, seven days a week since November 2000, NASA and its international partners have sustained a continuous human presence in low-Earth orbit, including at least one American – a streak that will soon reach 25 years. When viewed in the history of spaceflight, the International Space Station is perhaps one of humanity's most amazing accomplishments, a shining example of cooperation in space among the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan and Russia. But all good things must come to an end. In 2030, the International Space Station will be deorbited: driven into a remote area of the Pacific Ocean. I'm an aerospace engineer who has helped build a range of hardware and experiments for the ISS. As a member of the spaceflight community for over 30 years and a 17-year member of the NASA community, it will be hard for me to see the ISS come to an end. Since the first pieces of the International Space Station were launched in 1998, the station has been home to significant research accomplishments across domains that include materials science, biotechnology, astronomy and astrophysics, Earth science, combustion and more. Astronauts performing research inside the space station and payload experiments attached to the station's exterior have generated many publications in peer-reviewed science journals. Some of them have advanced our understanding of thunderstorms, led to improvements in the crystallization processes of key cancer-fighting drugs, detailed how to grow artificial retinas in space, explored the processing of ultrapure optical fibers and explained how to sequence DNA in orbit. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! In total, more than 4,000 experiments have been conducted aboard the ISS, resulting in more than 4,400 research publications dedicated to advancing and improving life on Earth and helping forge a path for future space exploration activities. The ISS has proven the value of conducting research in the unique environment of spaceflight – which has very low gravity, a vacuum, extreme temperature cycles and radiation – to advance scientists’ understanding of a wide range of important physical, chemical and biological processes. But in the wake of the station's retirement, NASA and its international partners are not abandoning their outpost in low-Earth orbit. Instead, they are looking for alternatives to continue to take advantage of low Earth orbit's promise as a unique research laboratory and to extend the continuous, 25-year human presence some 250 miles (402 kilometers) above the Earth’s surface. In December 2021, NASA announced three awards to help develop privately owned, commercially operated space stations in low-Earth orbit. For years, NASA has successfully sent supplies to the International Space Station using commercial partners, and the agency recently began similar business arrangements with SpaceX and Boeing for transporting crew aboard the Dragon and Starliner spacecraft, respectively. Based on the success of these programs, NASA invested more than US$400 million to stimulate the development of commercial space stations and hopefully launch and activate them before the ISS is decommissioned. In September 2025, NASA issued a draft announcement for Phase 2 partnership proposals for commercial space stations. Companies that are selected will receive funding to support critical design reviews and demonstrate stations with four people in orbit for at least 30 days. NASA will then move forward with formal design acceptance and certification to ensure that these stations meet NASA's stringent safety requirements. The outcome will allow NASA to purchase missions and other services aboard these stations on a commercial basis – similar to how NASA gets cargo and crew to the ISS today. Which of these teams will be successful, and on what timescale, remains to be seen. While these stations are being built, Chinese astronauts will continue to live and work aboard their Tiangong space station, a three-person, permanently crewed facility orbiting approximately 250 miles (402 km) above the Earth's surface. Consequently, if the ISS's occupied streak comes to an end, China and Tiangong will take over as the longest continually inhabited space station in operation: It's been occupied for approximately four years and counting. It will be several years before any of these new commercial space stations circle the Earth at around 17,500 miles per hour (28,000 kilometers per hour) and several years before the ISS is deorbited in 2030. So while you have a chance, take a look up and enjoy the view. On most nights when the ISS flies over, it is simply magnificent: a brilliant blue-white point of light, usually the brightest object in the sky, silently executing a graceful arc across the sky. Our ancestors could hardly have imagined that one day, one of the brightest objects in the night sky would have been conceived by the human mind and built by human hands.

A good telescope or pair of binoculars will help you see some of the night sky’s fainter objects. However, the unaided eye is enough to learn its stars and constellations, watch the moon, experience meteor showers and see satellites whizz across the night sky. Read on to find out what you can see in the night sky tonight, from planetary meet-ups to the ever-changing moon phases, meteor showers and more. Want to look even further ahead? Check out our monthly night sky guide our brightest planets guide also tells you what planets are visible and when this month. Track the ISS | Starlink satellite train | Moon viewing guide Sign up for our skywatching newsletter \"Night Sky This Week\" to discover this week's must-see night sky events, moon phases, and stunning astrophotos. Today sees the beginning of two meteor showers associated with the constellation Taurus, the Southern Taurids and Northern Taurids. They both begin today and peak on Nov. 3-4 and Nov. 8-9, respectively, which is close to the next full moon. Both are caused by comet 2P/Encke, which orbits the sun once every 3.3 years, according to NASA. The Southern Taurids and Northern Taurids each produce only around five \"shooting stars\" each per hour, but are famous for spawning extremely bright meteors that we call \"fireballs!\" Look out for them when you're stargazing over the next few weeks, they'll appear to have come from the east. — Jamie Carter Jupiter has been shining brightly close to the stars of the constellation Gemini for some months. This morning, visible in the east just after midnight and in the southwest before sunrise, the giant planet will form a vast triangle with Pollux in Gemini and a passing last-quarter moon. Pollux is one of the \"twins\" of Gemini. Its brother, Castor, is just above it, helping to create a Y-shape with Pollux, Jupiter and the moon.— Jamie Carter Look to the east a few hours after sunset to see a 77%-lit waning gibbous moon form a cosmic triangle with the Hyades and Pleiades open star clusters. While the Pleiades is 445 light-years from the sun, the Hyades is just 150 light-years. The Hyades covers a broader region of the sky than the Pleiades and is found around the bright orange star Aldebaran in the constellation Taurus. — Jamie Carter The Delta Aurigids are nothing to get excited about, but they may add an occasional sparkle to any stargazing session. If you're out with a telescope in the few hours before sunrise and you see a \"shooting star,\" it's probably from the Delta Aurigid meteor shower. It peaks early today, though only about two meteors per hour are expected. Emanating from close to bright star Capella in the constellation Auriga, the weak Delta Aurigid meteor shower runs from Oct. 10-18, 2025, according to In-The-Sky.org. — Jamie Carter It's one of the most famous stars in the night sky, but have you ever watched Betelgeuse rise? Today, it does so alongside a 56%-illuminated waning gibbous moon very close to its last quarter phase. The action will happen just before midnight, with red supergiant Betelgeuse rising in the east, with the moon on its left and the other very bright star in Orion, the blue supergiant Rigel, on its right. Look between Betelgeuse and Rigel for the three stars of Orion's Belt, rising nearly vertically as it clears the horizon. Jupiter will rise beneath the moon soon after. — Jamie Carter The moon has been passing through the Pleiades a lot in 2025, but tonight's conjunction is particularly close. Look east a couple of hours after sunset, and you'll see an 88%-illuminated waning gibbous moon less than a degree from the sparkling open cluster. Watch the Pleiades for the next few hours and you'll see the moon pass across its stars — a beautiful sight! — Jamie Carter At just 10 “shooting stars” per hour, the annual Draconid meteor shower is not the most prolific of the year. However, it’s one of the most convenient because it’s visible as soon as it gets dark. That’s because not only does Earth pass close to the orbit of comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner each Oct. 8, but the source constellation, Draco (the dragon), is close to Polaris, the North Star. It’s therefore circumpolar — high in the northern sky all night — so its meteors are visible to anyone in the Northern Hemisphere as soon as it gets dark. — Jamie Carter Here comes the main event — the appearance of the full Harvest Moon on the eastern horizon just after sunset. From North America, the full moon will rise several minutes after sunset, allowing it to shine a little brighter and a little earlier than last night. Get into position a few minutes before the time of moonrise where you are, with an unobstructed view east for the best chance of seeing the orange orb peek above the horizon. It's called the Harvest Moon this year — as opposed to the usual Hunter's Moon name for October's full moon — because it's the closest full moon to the equinox on Sept. 22, 2025. — Jamie Carter The moon turns full today, but since that global moment comes just 11 minutes before midnight for the eastern region of North America (11:47 p.m. EDT), it affects when it will look best in North America. In fact, the full moon will rise in the east within about 10–20 minutes of sunset, depending on location, so it will look pale as it becomes visible on the horizon. It will look full — and appear as an orange orb as the light fades — but you'll have to come back 24 hours later on Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2025, to see a more impactful sight as it rises in the east in a slightly darker sky. — Jamie Carter Look south-southeast after dark to see a waxing gibbous moon, now 87%-illuminated, directly above bright star Fomalhaut — the \"Autumn Star\" — with Saturn about the same distance to its left. One of the brightest stars in the night sky, but not visible above mid-northern latitudes, Fomalhaut is the most prominent star in the constellation Piscis Austrinus, the \"Southern Fish.\" — Jamie Carter September is a month of change in the night sky, with the stars of fall emerging as the stars of spring and summer descend. Look to the northeast after dark, about two hours after sunset tonight, and you'll see the yellow star Capella, one of the brightest stellar bodies visible from the Northern Hemisphere. It's the most prominent star in Auriga, \"The Charioteer,\" found beneath Perseus and Cassiopeia in September. Capella shines at the same brightness as Arcturus, in Boötes, a star of spring that's setting in the west in early October. You can find Arcturus by going \"arc to Arcturus\" using the handle of stars in the Big Dipper to travel in a west-northwest direction. You can find Capella by tracing a line through the top two stars of the bowl of four stars in the Big Dipper and continuing across the horizon to the northeast. — Jamie Carter Tonight, a 98%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon — just a day from being the full “Harvest Moon” — will shine just 3.5 degrees to the upper-left of Saturn. Having reached opposition a couple of weeks ago, Saturn is as big and bright as it ever gets, though to see its rings, you’ll need a small telescope. Although you can’t see Neptune, it’s just to the left of Saturn, forming an equilateral triangle with it and the moon. — Jamie Carter Although it forms one-third of the Summer Triangle, the star Altair often gets overlooked in favour of brighter Vega and the supergiant Deneb. However, at just 17 light-years from the solar system, it's one of the closest naked-eye stars visible from the Northern Hemisphere. The brightest star in the small constellation Aquila, \"The Eagle,\" is flanked by Tarazed and Alshain, which together form the eagle's head. — Jamie Carter Tonight offers a chance to explore Cygnus, \"The Swan,\" the largest constellation that forms part of the Summer Triangle asterism. The bright star Deneb, positioned at the top of the elongated Summer Triangle high above the western horizon tonight after dark, is one of the most distant stars visible to the naked eye, at around 1,600 light-years from the solar system. It marks the tail of the swan while Albireo, a colorful double star in the center of the Summer Triangle, represents the bird's head. — Jamie Carter A prominent star high in the western sky after dark tonight, Vega is part of the Summer Triangle, a vast asterism formed by Vega and two other bright stars, Altair (to the left of Vega) and Deneb (above Vega). It remains a prominent sight in the southwestern sky after sunset, but it's now sinking into the western horizon late at night. A mere 25 light-years away, Vega is part of the small constellation Lyra, \"The Harp.\" — Jamie Carter Today there's a first-quarter moon, where half of the moon's Earth-facing side is lit by direct sunlight. Until tonight, there's been a waxing crescent moon gradually growing in illumination and brightness, and sinking into the western horizon a little later each night. That will now ramp up as the moon becomes a waxing gibbous moon, brightening each night until it reaches its full phase in a week's time. — Jamie Carter The waxing crescent moon, now 23%-illuminated, will move into the constellation Scorpius tonight. Look for the lunar disk in the western sky at sunset, with its shadowed regions lit by Earthshine (sunlight reflected from Earth's oceans, clouds and ice onto the moon). It will sit to the lower right of the three stars that represent the head of the great scorpion in the constellation Scorpius — Acrab (top), Dschubba (middle) and Pi Scorpii (bottom). Dschubba, also called Delta Sco, is the brightest. — Jamie Carter The waxing crescent moon, now 31%-illuminated, will appear just three degrees to the left of the bright star Antares in the southwestern sky after sunset tonight. Often called the \"heart of the scorpion\", Antares is the brightest star in a binary star system about 555 light-years from Earth. — Jamie Carter Hopefully, you've had a chance to see the spiral arms of our galaxy, the Milky Way, arc above you in the night sky this summer. Now you get the chance to see another naked eye galaxy! It takes some practice, but it's relatively easy; first find the W-shaped constellation of Cassiopeia above northwest, and locate the star at the tip of the right-hand \"V.\" Use that V as an arrow that points at the next bright star going in a diagonal line to the horizon — that's Mirach. About two-thirds of the way along that journey is Andromeda, the farthest object it's possible to see with the naked eye at 2.5 million light-years. — Jamie Carter The waxing crescent moon, now 15%-illuminated, will shine tonight with Mars to its lower-right and Antares, the brightest star in the constellation Scorpius, to its upper-left. Mars sometimes passes close to Antares — as proven tonight — and consequently the two can be easily mistaken for one another in the night sky. The name Antares is derived from the ancient Greek phrase \"rival to Mars\", with Mars being the Roman name for the Greek god of war Ares — Jamie Carter The waxing crescent moon, now 9%-illuminated, will appear close to Mars tonight and be much easier to see than last night. Be outside looking south-southwest after sunset for the pair, which will sink swiftly below the horizon. After a year featuring lots of moon-Mars close conjunctions, this is the final show, as Mars is now transitioning out of the post-sunset night sky. — Jamie Carter Fresh from eclipsing the sun from the point of view of some lucky southern hemisphere skywatchers, the moon will tonight have edged just far enough from the glare of our star for Earthlings to see it once again just after sunset. Just 4%-illuminated, the waxing crescent moon will be a tough find, but may be visible just above the west-southwest after sunset. — Jamie Carter Another early start beckons for stargazers after two wondrous sights in one (admittedly early) sky-watching session. A super-slim 2%-illuminated waning crescent moon will rise in the east-northeast about 90 minutes before sunrise. Not only will Venus and Regulus shine above it — this time with the planet just below the star — but it may also be possible to see a triangular glow of light in the east called zodiacal light. The phenomenon, sometimes known as a \"false dawn\", arises when sunlight reflects off interplanetary dust orbiting the sun along the plane of the solar system. It makes for a spectacular sight, but is only visible from very dark sky destinations. — Jamie Carter With just one day remaining until the new moon, it's a fabulous night for stargazing, but the highlight is something virtually immune to light pollution of all kinds — Saturn at opposition. Though a view of its fabulous rings (albeit virtually side-on this year) demands at least a small telescope, Saturn will rise in the east around sunset and set in the west around sunrise. That's the beauty of it being at opposition — when Earth gets between it and the sun — as well as it looking its biggest, brightest and best in 2025. It will shine at magnitude 0.6. The moon will reach its new phase today at 2:54 p.m. EST. During this time, the moon is positioned roughly between the Earth and the sun, making its illuminated side invisible from Earth. It means dark skies that are perfect for stargazing — and it also causes a partial solar eclipse to be seen in some parts of the globe (though that will be seen tomorrow, local time). — Jamie Carter For those in New Zealand, the South Pacific and Antarctica, a partial solar eclipse happens close to sunrise today, local time. Visible only from the Southern Hemisphere, a big eclipsed sunrise will be seen from New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga. You can follow along with a livestream starting at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Sept. 21 showing real-time views of the eclipse courtesy of Time and Date. During the event, as much as 79% of the sun will be blocked by the moon. Then on Sept. 22 we mark the equinox, which occurs at 2:20 p.m. EDT (1820 GMT), heralding the onset of Autumn in the northern hemisphere — Jamie Carter Are you ready for the naked eye sight of the month? If you got up early yesterday to see the crescent moon, persuade yourself to repeat the process. Your reward will be a spectacular conjunction of a 6%-illuminated waning crescent moon with Venus and Regulus. The three will align incredibly closely, with a mere half a degree between them. Look to the east-northeast horizon about an hour before sunrise. — Jamie Carter It's at this time of the year that the Milky Way's core puts on its final good show for skywatchers in the Northern Hemisphere. It's visible in the south-southwest immediately after it gets dark for those with both dark skies and a little patience, with its glowing ribbon of stars dust and gas running through the vast Summer Triangle asterism — specifically from Deneb to Altair — and down to the horizon. For a best-ever, jaw-dropping view of the bright core of the Milky Way, go to dark regions of the Southern Hemisphere (outback Australia, Southern Africa, southern South America, or a Pacific island) in July and August, from where the center of the Milky Way's core will be visible stretching straight up above you. — Jamie Carter An 11%-illuminated waning crescent moon will appear directly above bright Venus before sunrise on Sept. 18, blazing away at magnitude -3.9 just a few short days ahead of its new moon phase. Look closely at Venus and you'll notice that there's a bright star just below it. That's Regulus, the brightest star in the constellation Leo. It's also the ideal morning to witness the Earthshine phenomenon, as sunlight reflected from Earth bounces onto the lunar surface. — Jamie Carter It may be a famous constellation, but Pisces, \"the fishes,\" is not easy to find. It's made up largely of faint stars and demands a dark September night and some patience. However, with those in hand, it's relatively easy to find the core part of it, particularly because this year, Saturn can be used as a guiding light. Look east after dark and find Saturn in the south — it will be the \"star\" with a constant light, unlike the others, that will flicker. Look directly above Saturn at five (though some say seven) stars in an oval shape. That's the Circlet of Pisces. — Jamie Carter On Sept. 16, a 28%-illuminated waning crescent moon will be easily visible in the pre-dawn sky close to three bright points of light. To its lower right will be bright Jupiter, with the two bright stars of the constellation Gemini on its left side. To the moon's lower left will be orangey Pollux (34 light-years from the solar system), while to its upper left will be yellowy Castor (51 light-years). Together, they'll create the illusion of a rhomboid shape, with each object about four degrees apart. — Jamie Carter Most stargazers focus on watching moonrise only on the night of the full moon, but it can be a spectacular sight for many nights afterwards. Tonight, about an hour before midnight, the 64%-illuminated waning gibbous moon will rise just below and to the left of the Pleiades star cluster in the constellation Taurus. Catch the moon as it rises to see it glow in golden-orange hues. — Jamie Carter For those lucky enough to have a clear view of the west-southwest horizon, a lovely sight awaits just after sunset when Mars and Spica sink together. Although the timing will have to be precise because they'll sink in the gathering twilight shortly after sunset, reddish Mars will be just above right of blueish Spica, the brightest star in the constellation Virgo. — Jamie Carter The moon will reach its last quarter phase today, meaning 50% of its Earth-facing side will be lit by the sun. The line across the middle of the lunar surface — known as the terminator — creates shadows and brings craters into view. However, for stargazers, tonight marks the beginning of the moon's rise after midnight, followed by a decrease in illumination, creating ideal conditions for skywatching and astronomy. — Jamie Carter Tonight offers a good opportunity to locate the iconic, almost ever-present constellation Cassiopeia, \"The Queen.\" A circumpolar constellation that appears to revolve around Polaris, the North Star, it's now rising higher into the sky at night. It begins as an \"E\" shape above northeast and rises higher in the north as an \"M\" shape. It's always opposite the Big Dipper, whose position is easy to recall with the memory aid \"spring up, fall down.\" For Cassiopeia, it's \"fall up, spring down.\" — Jamie Carter It's a common phrase, but can you see the \"Man in the Moon?\" It refers to the blunt image of dark patches on the lunar surface that, to the naked and untrained eye, make the moon's Earth-facing side resemble the eyes, nose and mouth of a human face. The eyes and mouth are, of course, basalt plains on the moon known as maria. It's all a form of Pareidolia — the human tendency to look for patterns where they don't exist. — Jamie Carter The full \"Corn Moon\" may have passed, but tonight presents yet another grand view, as a 97%-illuminated waning gibbous moon sits close to Saturn in the constellation Pisces. The pairing will be visible throughout the night, with Neptune lurking between the two — though the ice giant will be too dim to see with the naked eye. With its annual opposition on Sept. 20, Saturn is now close to its brightest and best in 2025. — Jamie Carter A couple of hours before sunrise on Sept. 9 is the peak of the ε-Perseid meteor shower, a lesser-known display of about five “shooting stars” per hour from the Perseus constellation, according to In-The-Sky.org. It’s not worth planning an early start for it, but if you’re up anyway doing astronomy, it’s worth knowing about. Later in the day, after sunset, the now 92%-illuminated waning gibbous moon continues its appearance near Saturn in the constellation Pisces throughout the night, though tonight there’s a much wider separation between the two. — Jamie Carter Today, we celebrate the 48th launch anniversary of NASA's Voyager 1 mission, which lifted off aboard a Titan-Centaur rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Sept. 5, 1977, destined to expand humanity's understanding of the solar system and the greater universe beyond. The spacecraft is now over 23 light-hours away (the time it takes for a message to be relayed to and from it), but can you find its approximate location in the night sky? Voyager 1 is currently in the constellation Ophiuchus, very close to that vast summer constellation's bright star Rasalhague, which forms a diamond shape with the three bright stars of the famous \"Summer Triangle\" asterism now high in the western sky. Ophiuchus is recognised as the 13th zodiac sign because the sun passes through it for a portion of the year. — Jamie Carter As darkness descends, look due east for the appearance of the Great Square of Pegasus, a prominent asterism — or formation of stars — in the night sky that's not part of an official constellation. The Great Square is the core of the constellation Pegasus and is comprised of four obvious corner stars — Scheat, Alpheratz, Markab and Algenib. Its appearance in the east signals the changing of the seasons and the coming of the southward equinox, now just two weeks away. — Jamie Carter September's full moon is often called the Harvest Moon, but not this month. The crucial date is that of the southward equinox, which occurs on Sept. 22 this year. The closest full moon to the equinox gets the moniker \"Harvest Moon,\" which this year goes to October's full moon on Oct. 7. That leaves September's full moon with the fill-in name \"Corn Moon.\" Either way, it will be best seen rising at moonrise in the east this evening, shortly after sunset. Those in parts of Asia, Australia and the Pacific will see a total lunar eclipse as the moon passes entirely through Earth's deepest shadow to take on a deep reddish hue for 82 minutes, a phenomenon known as a \"blood moon.\" Those in Europe and Africa will see it eclipsed as it rises, though it likely won't be noticeable to most. None of the eclipse will be seen from North or South America. — Jamie Carter Look due west after sunset, and you'll see Arcturus close to the horizon. It's the brightest star in the constellation Boötes, which at this time of year looks like a Y-shape — or a cocktail glass — extending above Arcturus. The red giant star is located some 37 light-years from our solar system and is the fourth-brightest star in the night sky. With a low view of the northwestern horizon, you can still just about make the famous star-hop by following the curve of stars in the handle of the Big Dipper, due north, to go in an \"arc to Arcturus.\" There's a mythological link, too; the Big Dipper is part of the constellation Ursa Major, \"The Great Bear,\" with the name Arcturus meaning \"Guardian of the Bear.\" — Jamie Carter Mars is now way past its best and will be behind the sun by January. You can still see it, however, low on the west-southwest horizon shortly after sunset, shining to the right of the bright star Spica in the constellation Virgo. Today is the 49th landing anniversary of Viking 2, one of the first NASA spacecraft to touch down on the Martian surface. It set down in Utopia Planitia near the edge of the Martian polar ice cap. Viking 1 landed on July 20 and sent back the first image of the Martian surface. Mars will next reach its bright opposition — when it swings close to Earth — on Feb. 19, 2027. — Jamie Carter If you watched last month's \"planet parade\", you'll have seen Mercury make a spectacular appearance alongside Venus and Jupiter. Its apparent journey to and from the sun's glare — from our point of view of Earth — is now on the wane, with an hour before sunrise today being the best time to be in position to see the \"Swift Planet's\" final appearance, close to bright star Regulus in the constellation Leo. Regulus will be just to the lower-right of Mercury. Be quick because both will fade long before sunrise. — Jamie Carter August is prime time to view the constellation Sagittarius, which lies across the busiest section of the Milky Way from the point of view of the solar system — the galactic center point. Dense starfields and nebulas abound in this part of the sky, but the easiest shape of stars to see resembles a teapot. Look to the southern horizon a few hours after sunset, and you'll see eight stars just to the left of the brightest part of the Milky Way, resembling a handle, teapot and spout. The teapot tips forward slightly, with the Milky Way acting as steam rising from its spout. — Jamie Carter Low on the southwest horizon, about 45 minutes after dark, you'll find a big, bright, waxing crescent moon just shy of its plump first quarter phase. It will be just to the lower-right of Antares, the brightest star in the summer constellation Scorpius, \"The Scorpion.\" — Jamie Carter Rise at the latest an hour before sunrise and cast your eyes to the eastern horizon. You'll see a neat equilateral triangle with Jupiter at the top, the bright star Procyon at the bottom-right and super-bright Venus at the bottom-left. If the sky is dark enough and your eyesight is sharp, you'll notice a fuzzy patch on the left-hand side of Venus, close to the planet. That's the Beehive Cluster (M44), an open cluster of about 1,000 stars and one of the nearest to the solar system. Take along a pair of binoculars for the best view. — Jamie Carter Aug. 31 was the best time to catch Venus at its closest to the Beehive Cluster (M44) in the constellation Cancer, but about an hour and a half before sunrise on Sept. 1, the sight will still impress low on the east-northeast horizon. Shining at magnitude -3.9, Venus will be blazingly bright and easy to spot, though a pair of binoculars will make it easier to spot M44. From about an hour before sunrise, you may see Mercury rise into view at magnitude -2, with Venus equidistant between it and Jupiter at magnitude -1.4 above and to the east. — Jamie Carter If you have seen any \"shooting stars\" this season, there's a good chance that they will have been Perseids, which, as their name suggests, appeared to streak away from a point of origin located in the ancient constellation Perseus, \"The Hero.\" Rising in the northeast is the W-shape of the constellation Cassiopeia as darkness falls. The most famous shape in Perseus is a curve of stars called the Segment of Perseus, with the bright star Miram in its center. Most of the stars in Perseus are in the Perseus Moving Group (also called the Alpha Persei Cluster), which is about 570 light-years from the solar system. — Jamie Carter Look to the southwest about 45 minutes after dark, and low on the horizon, you'll find a 21%-illuminated waxing crescent moon. To its right will be Spica, and beyond that, Mars. Look high above for the Big Dipper (The Plough), identifying the four stars that form its handle. Follow then in a curve to the next bright star — Arcturus in the constellation Boötes, which will be directly above Spica and Mars. You've just performed one of the most famous star-hops in stargazing — \"Arc to Arcturus, spike to Spica.\" — Jamie Carter Look to the southwest to see the 14%-illuminated waxing crescent moon shine with Mars on its right and the bright star Spica on its left. Spica, the brightest star in the constellation Virgo, is 250 light-years from the solar system. — Jamie Carter Look due west about 30 minutes after the sun sets, and you may see one of the most delicate signs in all nature — a young moon. Just 8%-illuminated, a waxing crescent moon will shine just below and to the right of Mars. Although the red planet is still visible after sunset, it's now faint. — Jamie Carter It's August. The moon is down. That can mean only one thing. It's peak Milky Way season! Our home galaxy will look its very best tonight, with no moonlight in the sky. It's also at its most dramatic and convenient, visible, arcing from high in the southeast to the southern horizon, with the brightest part — the core, or galactic center point — low on the southern horizon. If you're struggling to see it, that's because you're looking at light-polluted skies. Get away from city lights — about 25 miles (40 km) south, where the southern horizon is dark — and you'll see it. Any newish smartphone boasting a \"night mode\" can take a decent image of the Milky Way, but do keep it still, either by using a tripod or simply resting it on something like a gatepost or table. — Jamie Carter Related: Black Moon darkens August skies — here's how to hunt sparking wonders in the Milky Way this weekend There's not much to see, but today, the moon reaches its new phase, slipping roughly between Earth and the sun to get lost in the glare of our star for a day or two. It will emerge as a crescent in the evenings to come. This month, the new moon has a special name — a \"black moon.\" It's purely an astronomical term for the third new moon in a season with four new moons. Strictly speaking, it's a \"seasonal black moon.\" Related: A rare Black Moon rises with the sun on Aug. 23: Here's what to expect Can you see a black moon? No — not this year — but it is possible during a solar eclipse when its silhouette is visible in eclipse glasses. That's exactly what happens one lunar year (12 orbits of the moon around the sun — 354 days) from today, when the next total solar eclipse on Earth is visible from Greenland, Iceland and Spain on Aug. 12, 2026. More importantly, with the \"black moon\" out of the sky altogether, it's a chance to take advantage of the increased hours of darkness to go stargazing. — Jamie Carter You'll never see Pluto with the naked eye. Or with a telescope, for that matter, unless it's incredibly powerful. However, it's useful to know where it is in the sky, and today is a good excuse, for 19 years ago — on Aug. 26, 2006 — the International Astronomical Union voted to approve a new definition of \"planet\" that excluded Pluto. Since then, it's been known as a dwarf planet. The discovery of a similarly sized body, Eris, prompted re-evaluation — and ultimately reclassification — of Pluto, hence the vote. Look high in the southeast just after dark for the Summer Triangle, that vast elongated asterism of three bright stars — Deneb and Vega at the top and Altair at the bottom. Come down to the horizon from Altair. About two-thirds of the way through that journey is the approximate position of Pluto. Since it takes 248 years to orbit the sun, its position doesn't change much from year to year. — Jamie Carter Head away from city lights and look high above the southern horizon a couple of hours after sunset on Aug. 21 to find the three stars of the famous 'Summer Triangle' asterism astride the Milky Way. Altair — the brightest star in the constellation Aquila — can be seen twinkling to the left of the Milky way, closest to the horizon, with bright Vega visible to its upper right on the other side of the galactic ribbon of stars, dust and gas. Deneb, the tail of the swan represented by the constellation Cygnus, will be visible embedded in the glowing band of the Milky Way to Vega's left, completing the cosmic triangle. It's going to be a challenging sight that requires a very clear eastern horizon and excellent timing, but how often do three exquisite celestial sights align in the night sky? If you can get some binoculars on Mercury as it rises (start looking about an hour before sunrise), look just above it for a sparkling clump of stars — the Beehive Cluster. Above and to the left of that will be an incredibly delicate, 4%-illuminated waning crescent moon. Thursday marks the eighth anniversary of the \"Great American Eclipse,\" a total solar eclipse that crossed the U.S. on Aug. 21, 2017. That day, the NASA website's live broadcast got more than 50 million views and almost 31 million unique views on Facebook. The next one in the U.S. is on Aug. 23, 2044, in Montana and North Dakota. That's just 19 years from this Saturday! — Jamie Carter If you're going to rise early once this month, make it today because in the east, an hour before sunrise, the \"planet parade\" peaks. You can look for Mercury beneath and Jupiter above, but your eyes will be drawn to what's between the two — a spectacularly slender 9%-illuminated waning crescent moon next to bright Venus. Look just to the left of the moon and you'll see Pollux, one of the \"twins\" in the constellation Gemini. Just above it, you'll find its \"brother,\" Castor. — Jamie Carter You may have glimpsed it already, but summer 2025's \"planet parade\" now begins its grandest phase. Be up and looking east an hour before sunrise and you'll see a now 16%-illuminated waning crescent moon form a slight curve with Jupiter and Venus. Today, Mercury reaches what astronomers call the \"greatest elongation west,\" when the tiny \"Swift Planet\" reaches its farthest distance from the sun in the pre-dawn sky. — Jamie Carter The presence of a full moon this week has ruined the Perseid meteor shower's peak last Monday/Tuesday. Can we salvage anything? Perhaps. With the moon on the cusp of its last quarter phase, it won't rise until shortly before midnight. That gives sky-watchers a little time in dark skies to see what remains of the 100-or-so \"shooting stars\" that were buzzing around last Monday. You can look anywhere in the night sky, but know that the source constellation, Perseus, is rising in the northeast after sunset. Any \"shooting stars\" you do see are grains of dust left in the inner solar system by comet Swift-Tuttle. — Jamie Carter A last quarter moon is an important waymarker for stargazers, and this month, that goes double. It marks the point in the moon's orbit when it wanes to being half-lit, with it shrinking to an ever-slimmer crescent over the next week. As well as leaving the skies darker when it is present, a last quarter moon rises at midnight and about 50 minutes later each night thereafter, clearing the evening skies of any natural light pollution. As luck would have it, the half-lit moon will tonight rise just a few degrees above the sparkling open cluster of stars known as the Pleiades, or \"Seven Sisters\" — a favorite of many stargazers — in the constellation Taurus, \"The Bull.\" — Jamie Carter Whisper it, but there's a must-see planetary conjunction building in the pre-dawn sky. Should you bother to get up for it? If you're only going to do so once, wait until Tuesday, Aug. 19, when the moon will be slimmer and Mercury will be highest — but if there's a clear sky forecast this morning, go for it. Your reward will be a 36%-illuminated waning crescent moon high above Jupiter, Venus and, closer to the eastern horizon, possibly Mercury. Be in place about an hour before sunrise. — Jamie Carter The \"planet parade\" gets even more impressive this morning before sunrise as a now 26%-illuminated waning crescent moon gets a little closer to Jupiter and Venus, with Mercury peeking above the eastern horizon as dawn approaches. Look for \"Earthshine\" on the crescent moon and, to the right of the planets, for the winter constellation of Orion \"The Hunter\" rising. Let the three stars in Orion's Belt point you towards the bright star Sirius on the east-northeast horizon. — Jamie Carter Some sights in the night sky are small but perfectly formed. Such an object is Brocchi's Cluster, also known as Collinder 399 and, more descriptively, as the Coathanger. Visible close to the Summer Triangle stars in the southeast after dark, Brocchi's Cluster does require dark skies, but it's more obvious than you might think. Almost exactly halfway between the bright stars Vega and Altair in the Summer Triangle, Brocchi's Cluster is about 10 easily visible stars in the shape of — you guessed it — a coat hanger, complete with hook. Just bear in mind that the coat hanger is upside down as viewed from the Northern Hemisphere. — Jamie Carter One of the smallest but oldest-named constellations, Sagitta, \"The Arrow,\" is found between the bright stars Deneb and Altair (but much closer to the latter) in the Summer Triangle asterism high in the southeast after dark. It's only four stars, but they're arranged in a dramatic arrow shape that's unmistakable. It points towards the northern horizon. — Jamie Carter. It's a shame, but tonight's peak of the annual Perseid meteor shower isn't going to provide many \"shooting stars.\" Although there can be as many as 100 per hour in the darkest hours of the peak night, a waning gibbous moon — about 91%-illuminated — will rise in the east just as it gets dark and will shine brightly for the rest of the night. That will bleach the sky and make the Perseids hard to see, but the brightest ones should still be visible. Be outside just before midnight and stand with your back to the bright moon for the best chance. — Jamie Carter In what has to be one of the celestial highlights of August, the two brightest planets in the solar system will come to within a degree of each other in the pre-dawn sky. Look to the east-northeast for the fabulous sight of the second and fifth planets from the sun appearing just a width of an outstretched finger apart. Be in place an hour before sunrise where you are to see the two brightest planets shine side by side — it's not something that happens too often. By the way, you'll hear lots of stories about six planets being \"in alignment\" this morning from people who have no idea what alignment means. Yes, Uranus is in the sky (high above Jupiter and Venus), and Neptune is close to Saturn beside the 89%-illuminated moon, but it's not an alignment — the planets all orbit on the same path through the sky, known as the ecliptic (the plane of the solar system). It's like saying cars align with each other on a road! — Jamie Carter If you've been watching the sky for some time, you'll have seen a full moon appear on the eastern horizon during dusk. It's an exquisite sight, but exactly which night to look can be tricky to tell in advance. The effect looks best when the full moon appears about 20 minutes after sunset, when the surrounding landscape is still slightly aglow from the recently set sun. That perfect time is tomorrow, but tonight, the almost full moon will rise almost simultaneously with the sunset. So get yourself a clear view of the eastern horizon and see summer's second full moon appear in a muted orange. Then come back tomorrow for a second helping — and a subtly different view. — Jamie Carter Read more: August full moon 2025 rises this weekend: Here's how to see the stunning 'Sturgeon Moon' At 3:56 a.m. EDT today, the moon will be 100%-illuminated by the sun and be at its full phase while in the constellation Capricornus, \"The Goat.\" Although the conditions were good last night to watch an almost full moonrise, there's a second chance tonight. With the moon rising in the east about half an hour after sunset, the landscape should still be visible as a bright orange orb appears. Expect a dramatic sight. — Jamie Carter The Summer Triangle is an anchor of the seasonal night sky. Dominating the southeastern sky immediately after dark, its three bright stars — Deneb, Vega and Altair — can help stargazers navigate all summer long. Altair, in particular, can also act as a signpost to several night sky sights you could otherwise easily miss. One is a very tiny but beautiful constellation called Delphinus, \"The Dolphin.\" Found just to the left of Altair soon after dark at this time of year, Delphinus is formed from five stars clustered close together, with the four making an unmistakable diamond shape. — Jamie Carter The heliacal rising of a star is the date when it first becomes visible in the east just before dawn, having previously been visible in the west just after sunset. For the brightest star in the night sky, Sirius, its heliacal rising holds an important place in human culture, and specifically in ancient Egypt, where it marked the beginning of a new year. The exact date you can see Sirius swap from the evening sky to the morning sky will depend on where you live. According to data from Sky & Telescope, subtract your latitude from 29 to get the date in August. For example, if you live at 50 degrees north, it's Aug. 21, while those at 40 degrees north will see Sirius before sunrise for the first time this year on Aug. 11. It will appear on the east-southeast horizon, with the three stars of a vertical Orion's Belt pointing straight down at it. — Jamie Carter The fourth brightest star in the nighttime sky, Arcturus, is the brightest in the constellation Boötes, \"The Plowman.\" Its name means \"Guardian of the Bear\" in Greek because it's close to the Big Dipper/The Plough. This month, you can find it high above the western horizon. Relatively close to Earth at 37 light-years away, Arcturus sits at the bottom of a pattern of stars in the Boötes constellation that looks like a champagne flute. — Jamie Carter Having found Vega earlier this week, now look for Deneb, a bright star in the southeast that's the top-left corner of the Summer Triangle asterism. One of the most distant stars visible to the naked eye, Deneb, is approximately 1,500 light-years from the solar system. So why is it visible at all? A blue-white supergiant around 200 times larger than the sun, it's one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way galaxy. — Jamie Carter Jupiter is currently shining in the pre-dawn sky just below Venus. Although it's a fine sight to the naked eye, put any pair of binoculars on the giant planet and its four large moons suddenly appear as points of light, just as they did to Galileo in 1610 when he put the first astronomical telescope up to his eye. Jupiter and its moons are currently being investigated by NASA's Juno probe, which was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, on Aug. 5, 2011 — exactly 14 years ago. Juno has been at Jupiter since 2016 and has made discoveries ranging from cyclones to Io's flowing magma. However, this is the last launch anniversary we can happily celebrate because Juno is scheduled to end its mission on September 15, 2025. Will it get an extended mission? In normal times, yes, but if Trump's 2026 budget call does slash NASA funding by 24%, Juno may end its mission prematurely. — Jamie Carter Stargazers often look for constellations and asterisms (shapes), but what about stars? If the constellations are just imaginary shapes in the night sky, the stars are real — the anchors and signposts — and not only do they look different, but many of them have names as old as human culture. Arguably, the most important star in the night sky is Vega, an anchor star of summer. A mere 25 light-years from the solar system, it's part of the Summer Triangle asterism in the southeast after dark. It's assigned zero magnitude because all other stars' brightness is measured relative to it. The second brightest in the Northern Hemisphere, Vega was the first to be photographed in 1850 and was imaged by the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes in 2024. — Jamie Carter Venus has dominated the post-sunset and, more recently, the pre-dawn night skies for all of 2025 so far. Its apparition as the bright \"Morning Star\" — as stargazers call it when it's visible before sunrise — peaks tonight as it reaches its highest altitude in the morning sky while in the hand of Orion, \"The Hunter.\" Exactly how high it is will depend on where you are, but it's the easiest time to see Venus in the east before dawn this year. It will now wane, eventually passing around the back of the sun on Jan. 6, 2026, as it reaches superior solar conjunction. — Jamie Carter Since it reached first quarter phase, when half of its Earth-facing side appears lit as seen from our planet, the moon is now brightening the sky and making faint stars hard to see. However, it's a great time to see Maria (lunar \"seas\" of ancient lava in impact craters) on the moon. The most prominent are Mare Serenitatis (Sea of Serenity) and Mare Tranquillitatis (Sea of Tranquility), with three smaller maria beneath them: Mare Nectaris (Sea of Nectar), Mare Fecunditatis (Sea of Fertility) and Mare Crisium (Sea of Crises). — Jamie Carter The moon has been passing close to Antares — the brightest star in the Scorpius constellation — on every orbit this year, and tonight it will pass directly beneath it. Antares is one of four bright stars the moon regularly passes close to and occasionally occults, the others being Aldebaran in Taurus, Regulus in Leo and Spica in Virgo. That's because they lie near the ecliptic, which closely matches the moon's path through the sky. The close conjunctions and occultations occur in a predictable, repeating series over several years as part of the 18.6-year-long lunar cycle. — Jamie Carter If you've been thinking about Apollo 11 this month, 11 nights on from the 56th anniversary of its mission, it's finally a good night to look for where it landed on the moon. Anytime after sunset tonight, look at the now 39%-lit waxing crescent moon, more specifically at the terminator. Right in the middle of the moon, to the right of the terminator, is a dark patch — that's an ancient lava field called Mare Tranquillitatis — the Sea of Tranquility — where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed at 9:41 p.m. EDT on July 20, 1969. — Jamie Carter Related: Discover where the Eagle might have landed: How to find Apollo 11's backup sites on the moon The waxing crescent moon is such a beautiful sight for skywatchers during the week after a new moon. However, while watching its face gradually be revealed by sunlight is a treat, the moon also conducts a guided tour of some of the night sky's brightest stars. Drop in on the tour tonight, when it will hang just a degree or so from Spica, the brightest star in the constellation Virgo. Spica, a blue-white binary star, is 250 light-years from the solar system. Expect up to 20 \"shooting stars\" per hour at the peak of the Delta Aquariids tonight. The result of debris left in the inner solar system by comet Marsden and comet Kracht, an early-setting waxing crescent, should mean decent viewing conditions. As a bonus, it's also the peak night for the Alpha Capricornids, which promise another 5-10 \"shooting stars\" per hour. The farther south you are, the more meteors you're likely to see. If you want to get your eyes on something few other skywatchers ever do, be outside looking west immediately after sunset. On offer is a 2%-illuminated waxing crescent moon, just a day past its new moon phase. It will be very close to the northwestern horizon, so you'll need a low view (and a cloudless horizon), as well as a pair of binoculars. — Jamie Carter If yesterday's sight of a super-slender crescent moon was a difficult catch, tonight's is slightly easier and likely more rewarding. Tonight, the moon will be 6%-illuminated and a little easier to see, but it's what's nearby that will make it really special. Look about two degrees to the right of the moon, and you'll see the bright star Regulus, shining at 1.3 magnitude. The brightest star in the constellation Leo, \"The Lion,\" Regulus, is over 70 light-years from the solar system. — Jamie Carter Higher in the west after sunset than it was last night, an 11%-illuminated waxing crescent moon will shine, with Mars to its upper left. The mostly dark face of the moon will catch Earth's reflected glow, giving it a faint shine. According to NASA, an astronaut standing on the moon at this time would see a spectacular, fully lit Earth, with the lunar surface around subtly lit by Earthshine, just as dark nights on Earth are lit by the light of the full moon. The phenomenon is easiest to see about three mornings before and the evenings after the new moon. — Jamie Carter Very early this morning, we see the peak of a minor meteor shower, the Piscis Austrinids. Expect about five meteors per hour, according to In-The-Sky.org. Come back many hours later, about 45 minutes after sunset, and look west for the lovely sight of a 19% waxing crescent moon to the left of Mars. It's all that remains of the stunning \"planet parades\" of February and March. The two solar system bodies will be separated by about a degree — the width of your little finger held against the sky. — Jamie Carter With a new moon tonight, there's no moonlight or distractions, so use the darkness well and find one of the oldest known naked-eye stars. A yellow dwarf like our sun, Mu Cassiopeia A is a whopping 12.7 billion years old. It's actually one star in a visual binary star system (also called a double star) called Marfak in the constellation Cassiopeia. Look for it above the north-northeast horizon tonight by first identifying the W-shape of Cassiopeia. Use the four outside stars of Cassiopeia and connect them towards the horizon to make a larger V-shape with a brighter star below — that's Marfak. Fittingly, its name means \"the elbow.\" — Jamie Carter Here's a challenging one — but it will be worth the effort. This morning, rising in the east-northeast but never getting far from the horizon in twilight, a slender 3%-illuminated waning crescent moon will shine close to Jupiter. This is the final morning it's possible to see it before it heads into the glare of the sun to become a new moon. The moon at this stage of its orbit is typically very hard to pick out with the naked eye. However, using Jupiter as a guardrail will help. Locate the giant planet, shining at -1.8 magnitude, and look just to its left. They'll be about five degrees apart. You'll need a clear horizon. — Jamie Carter The waning crescent moon will have moved another 12 degrees east on its journey around Earth this morning. By now, it's close to the sun's glare, so low in the east and just 7%-illuminated. This final Earthshine morning will be the best, with the slender nature of the lunar crescent and the delicate impact of Earth's reflected light making the moon a drop-dead gorgeous sight — but there's much more to see. The moon will hang between Venus, to its right, and Jupiter, beneath it. Snake your way upwards from Jupiter to the moon, across to Venus and beyond to bright star Aldebaran in Taurus before heading up to the beautiful Pleiades. Now, head back to the horizon directly below the Pleiades and Aldebaran, and you may see Orion's belt shooting up. Six of the night sky's most beautiful and brightest objects in one (albeit early!) stargazing session! — Jamie Carter Prominent in the southeast right after dark and drifting across the south overnight is the Summer Triangle, a classic asterism that provides a staging post to swing the Milky Way. However, one of the Summer Triangle's bright stars, Deneb at top-left, is the lynchpin of the constellation Cygnus, \"The Swan.\" Deneb is the tail of the swan, with Albireo in the center of the Summer Triangle as its head. Native American cultures see the same shape as a salamander, a crane and a skeleton bird. — Jamie Carter Having familiarised yourself with the Cygnus constellation last night, take a look at it again and see something completely different. This time, you're looking for a cross-shape, and all you need to do is ignore some of the wing stars of Cygnus, then turn the entire shape upside down in your head. With Deneb at the top and Albireo at the bottom. It's oddly not as famous as the Southern Cross in the Southern Hemisphere, but the Northern Cross is much larger and easier to find. It's worth considering the rarity of both of the major stars; Deneb is one of the farthest stars that can be seen with the naked eye at 2,600 light-years distant from the solar system, while Albireo is a double star — one yellow-orange and one blue — though they're not visible to the naked eye. — Jamie Carter Here comes the sky-watching highlight of the month. Rise early this morning and look to the east-northeast about 45 minutes before sunrise for the spectacular conjunction of the moon and an open cluster of stars, and on an auspicious day for space exploration. A 24%-illuminated waning crescent moon will shine within the Pleiades, also known as M45 and the Seven Sisters. As you look at Earthshine lighting up the dark portion of the moon, including its Sea of Tranquility, think of the monumental achievement of NASA's Apollo 11 mission. On this day in 1969, at 3:17 p.m. EDT, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to land on and walk on the lunar surface. \"Houston, Tranquility Base here,\" said Armstrong. \"The Eagle has landed.\" — Jamie Carter If you can get up early this morning, on offer is the beautiful sight of a 15%-illuminated waning crescent moon close to Venus. The planet will shine brightly at -3.9 magnitude to the lower right of the moon. Look to the east about 45 minutes before sunrise. Aldebaran, the brightest star in Taurus, will be close by, forming a star-planet-moon equilateral triangle. It's another Earthshine morning, with Earth's reflected light clearly visible on the unlit portion of the moon. — Jamie Carter Rising around midnight tonight will be a last-quarter moon when the lunar surface appears half-lit from Earth. It's the starting gun for 10 nights of dark, moonless evening skies, which kicks off with the first appearance of Perseid meteors. The most famous and one of the most prolific meteor showers of the year, the Perseids, will this year likely disappoint on its peak night — August 11/12 — because of a recent full moon. So begin watching for shooting stars tonight and through the rest of July. Just don't expect the 100-per-hour rate possible on peak nights. It's one of the largest constellations in the night sky and visible for many months, but few stargazers know much about Ophiuchus, 'The Serpent Bearer.\" It's known as the 13th sign of the zodiac because, like the others, it's on the ecliptic, so the sun passes through it for 18 days from November 30. Between Scorpius and the Summer Triangle, the vast Ophiuchus constellation largely has faint stars, but its brightest star, Rasalhague, is easy to find — and can even be used to make the Summer Triangle into a Summer Diamond. Inside Ophiuchus — though not visible to the naked eye — is Barnard's Star, one of the closest stars to the sun at just six light-years distant. — Jamie Carter Look east around midnight tonight, and you’ll see a 70%-illuminated waning gibbous moon shining about two degrees above the planet Saturn. They’ll shine together all night. You won’t see it — it’s just beyond the capability of the human eye — but Neptune will be very close to Saturn. Saturn will come to its bright opposition on September 21, 2025, by which time its rings will have opened up slightly after being precisely side-on in March. From mid-northern latitudes, you're only likely to see the tail of Scorpius, \"The Scorpion,\" below which you'll see the bright red supergiant star Antares, which is also known as \"The Scorpion's Heart.\" Look above the southeastern horizon for the three stars that comprise its claws — Achrab, Dschubba and Fang. Shaula, a bright blue star that marks the Scorpion's tail, could go supernova at any time. At just 587 light-years distant, it's one of the closest supernova candidates. — Jamie Carter With the moon still bright, stick to bright stars when you're outside at night. A great target is one of the lesser-known stars of the Summer Triangle, that vast asterism visible in the southeast immediately after dark. Attention usually focuses on Deneb and Vega, marking the top of the triangle. Instead, focus on Altair at the bottom, which, as well as being the point of the Summer Triangle, is also the brightest star in the constellation Aquila, \"The Eagle.\" Altair is a mere 17 light-years distant. Flanking Altair is orangey Tarazed at 395 light-years and Alshain at 45 light-years, which collectively mark the head of the eagle. As a bonus, Aquila sits across the Milky Way; look below it for the richest, brightest core of our home galaxy. — Jamie Carter For weeks, Venus has been moving ever closer to the V-shape of stars that represents the core of the famous constellation Taurus, “The Bull.” This morning in the east, best viewed at least 45 minutes before sunrise, Earth’s sister planet will make its closest approach (about three degrees above) to the bright orange-yellow star Aldebaran. Above the pair will be the sparkling Pleiades open cluster of stars. Although this morning is the best time to view it, it will remain a notable sight until approximately July 18. Tonight, see the start of two minor meteor showers that combine to bring a steady stream of shooting stars to summer skies. Both the Delta Aquarid and Alpha Capricornid meteor showers begin tonight, both officially peaking on July 30, but in reality, any night in late July and early August is when you’ll see their prodigy. Today sees the rising of the first Summer full moon in the Northern Hemisphere. July's full moon has a few names, with its most popular in North America associated with the growth of new antlers on male buck deer. It's also called the Hay Moon and Thunder Moon. The moon will reach its full phase, which technically only lasts for a moment, at 4:37 p.m. EDT (2037 GMT). However, as always, the time to observe it will be as it appears on the southeastern horizon during dusk. Find out the exact time of moonrise where you are and be in a position to see it appear as a spectacular orange orb. As the night progresses, it will move into the southwestern sky, remaining remarkably low. That's because it's happening so soon after the Summer Solstice. Since the moon mirrors the sun, when the sun is high in the sky, the moon is low. From today through July 21, Venus will be as high in the pre-dawn night sky as it gets during its current apparition as the \"Morning Star.\" For this short time, it will be a genuine night-time object instead of the twilight sight it so often is. See it about 30 minutes before sunrise, and it will be around 25 degrees above the east-northeast horizon. It’s been lost in the sun's glare for the past few weeks and has effectively gone unseen since May, but this morning, the gas-giant planet will re-emerge into the pre-dawn morning sky. This morning, it will appear in the constellation Gemini and shine at magnitude -1.9, rising just before the sun (though if you want to see it, prepare for an “is that it?!” kinda view). Meanwhile, Venus will begin to shine above the east, just above Aldebaran in Taurus, getting closest on July 13. Jupiter won’t be an impressive object until mid-August. It will reach its bright opposition — when Earth briefly sits between it and the sun — on January 10, 2026. A waxing gibbous moon, now 92%-illuminated, will tonight shine in the southeastern sky about four degrees below Antares. A red supergiant star about 550 light-years from the solar system in the constellation Scorpius, \"the Scorpion,\" Antares translates to \"rival of Ares\" (Ares means Mars) because it sits close to the ecliptic, so the red planet passes close to it every few years. When that happens, they can be easily confused because Antares is a distinctive reddish color. However, there will be no confusion tonight because Mars will be on the opposite side of the sky in the west, in the constellation Leo. — Jamie Carter Although it was technically highest above the horizon on June 26 as seen from North America, today is when the \"Swift Planet\" Mercury is at its greatest elongation east. All that means is that Earth has a good view of Mercury as it appears to swing farthest from the sun from our point of view, in the evening sky. It's a view that has more to do with Earth's position in the solar system than Mercury's. It will shine at 0.5 magnitude, with Regulus in Leo and, beyond, Mars, to its upper left. — Jamie Carter Look to the northeast about an hour before sunrise, and you'll see the lovely sight of Venus, blazing away at -4.1 magnitude, close to the most beautiful open cluster of stars in the night sky, the Pleiades. Also called M45 and the Seven Sisters, it's bright because the light from its seven bright stars (and about 1,000 others) is shining on interstellar dust and causing a reflection nebula. Uranus is between Venus and the Pleiades, though at 5.8 magnitude, the eighth planet from the sun is too faint to see with the naked eye (and, besides, it's just a tiny blue dot even in a large telescope). — Jamie Carter Just as it did one lunar orbit ago, the moon, now an 86%-illuminated waxing gibbous, will shine close to the constellation Scorpius. It will approach its brightest star, giant Antares, on July 7, but tonight, it sits in the Scorpion's claws, three stars that trace out the celestial shape's pincers. Try to find the crescent of stars that make up the rest of the constellation. It's not that easy from mid-northern latitudes, where Scorpius rises in the east, moves along the southern horizon and sinks in the southwest. One reason of many to plan a stargazing trip to a more southerly location, or the Southern Hemisphere (though always plan to do that between last quarter moon and first quarter moon for dark moonless skies!). — Jamie Carter Go find your solar eclipse glasses. Is there an eclipse? No — the next one is on September 21, 2025, in the South Pacific, Antarctica and New Zealand. However, there is a reason for looking at the sun today. Earth is at what astronomers call aphelion, the point in its orbit at which it is furthest from the sun. Although it's only 1 arcminute smaller than at its perihelion (closest point) in January, it's a good excuse to look at the smallest possible sun in the daytime sky. Besides, you'll probably see sunspots. If you do, note where you think they are on the solar disk and compare them with the real-time HMI Intensitygram images of the sun from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, which are published every few minutes. — Jamie Carter Today at 2:31 p.m. EDT, the moon reaches its first quarter phase, when it will appear half-lit as seen from Earth and shine in the southwestern night sky. Look to its left and you'll see bright star Spica, the brightest star in the constellation Virgo. Come back tomorrow, and the moon will have waxed to 62%-illuminated and be much closer to Spica; this time, at it's lower-left. On either night, below the two, will be the little-known constellation Corus, \"The Crow.\" Its five main stars — Gienah, Kraz, Algorab, Minkar and Alchiba — should be relatively easy to find. — Jamie Carter Stargazing is best done little and often, typically in the early evening, which allows the new stars and constellations you learn to slowly sink in through repetition as the night sky gradually changes throughout the year. However, it is possible to cheat. Stay up until about 2:00 a.m. local time, and you'll see constellations rising that you otherwise wouldn't see for many weeks or months during the early evening. Rise at 2:00 a.m. tonight — perhaps while out camping in the balmy summer temperatures — and look east, and you'll see what is, in effect, the evening night sky for September, with the Great Square of Pegasus, an easy-to-recognise asterism, rising in the east below the Summer Triangle. — Jamie Carter Here's one more chance to see the crescent moon this month. Regaling the western horizon after dark tonight will be a now 33%-illuminated waxing crescent moon in an equidistant alignment with Mars and Regulus. Having pulled away from the brightest star in the constellation Leo, the red planet will gradually sink into the sun's glare, hanging on thanks to the lengthening nights but eventually disappearing by October to re-emerge in the pre-dawn sky. — Jamie Carter Look again to the west-northwest soon after dark for the best night of the month to see the crescent moon. Now almost 9%-illuminated and arguably at its most spectacular, it will also be much easier to find than yesterday, simply because it will be higher up in a darker sky for longer. Look for the reflected light of Earth on its dark side — Earthshine — and to its lower right for tiny Mercury, which will become harder to see over the next few nights as it sinks into the sun's glare. Tonight also sees the peak of the annual Bootid meteor shower, a minor affair that will see just a couple of meteors flying about from the constellation Boötes, \"The Herdsman,\" from comet 7P/Pons-Winnecke. — Jamie Carter About 45 minutes after sunset tonight, a beautiful alignment will be visible above the western horizon. The most obvious will be a 16%-illuminated waxing crescent moon, with visible \"Earthshine\" on its darkened limb. Look to its upper left, and you'll see the bright star Regulus and, beyond it, Mars, creating a lovely panorama of three equidistant celestial bodies. It's also a good lesson in scale and the importance of our line of sight because although they all appear aligned, it's just an optical illusion. While the moon is tonight 237,700 miles (382,800 kilometers) distant, Mars is 178 million miles (286 million km), and Regulus is 79 light-years away. If the moon were just an inch away, Mars would be 62 feet away and Regulus about 31,000 miles away. Space is BIG! — Jamie Carter Look above the west tonight immediately after dark at what is perhaps the highlight of the month for anyone interested in exploring the night sky with the naked eye. A beautiful 24%-illuminated crescent moon? Yes — but there's something else. Look just above the curve of the lunar crescent and you'll see Mars, shining at 1.5 magnitude, looking like a cherry on top. With a conjunction this close — just a fifth of a degree apart as seen from North America — it likely won't come as a surprise to learn that from the Pacific Ocean close to northern South America, the moon will briefly occult Mars, according to In The Sky. Such a thing was spectacularly imaged on January 13, 2025, by a new telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona. — Jamie Carter You'll need a low west-northwest horizon for this one, but it's worth making an effort to have a fine view of a slender moon close to Mercury and a couple of famous stars, all strung out in a curved, sickle-shaped formation. About 45 minutes after sunset tonight, a 3.4%-illuminated waxing crescent moon — making its first appearance in the post-sunset sky of its new orbit — will be positioned between two points of light. On its left will be Mercury, at its highest in the night sky of its current apparition (about 16 degrees as seen from mid-northern latitudes). It will shine at a magnitude of near-zero. To the right of the moon will be Pollux, then Castor, the two brightest stars in the constellation Gemini, 37 and 51 light-years from the sun, respectively. The four celestial bodies form an equidistant crescent, with about 2.5 degrees between each one, that will quickly sink into the horizon. — Jamie Carter At 5:33 a.m. EDT, the moon will be roughly between Earth and the sun as it reaches its new phase. That leaves the skies moonlight-free and, consequently, as dark as they get. However, in June in the Northern Hemisphere, it all depends on your latitude (if you're above 48.5 degrees north, then astronomical darkness — when the sun is 18 degrees below the horizon — doesn't occur for a few weeks on either side of the solstice). If it does get properly dark where you are, it's a good night to use binoculars or a small telescope to find objects beginning with 'M' in the night sky, such as the Great Hercules Cluster in the constellation Hercules (M13), the Ring Nebula in Lyra (M57) and the Lagoon Nebula in Sagittarius (M8). The 'M' comes from Charles Messier, a French comet-hunter who categorized 110 Messier objects— fuzzy objects in the night sky that could be confused with comets. He was born on June 26, 1730, exactly 295 years ago tomorrow. — Jamie Carter If you can access dark skies, late June is a great time to begin looking for the Milky Way. Although its arc of stars is always somewhat visible, from the Northern Hemisphere, we spend most of winter and spring looking only at its outer spiral arms. Come late June, the Milky Way's core begins to appear — and with the moon down, this week is perfect for finding it. You will, however, need to stay up late, with the couple of hours after midnight a good time to see it. Look due south; the band of stars will appear to stream down to the horizon through the Summer Triangle asterism — specifically from Deneb to Altair. — Jamie Carter Today is the solstice, the day the sun will not set at the North Pole and will not rise at the South Pole. Caused by Earth's axis being tilted about 23.5 degrees relative to its orbital plane around the sun — thus altering the amount of sunlight different parts of the globe receive at different times of the year (seasons!) — it marks the beginning of astronomical summer north of the equator (which is titled towards the sun) and winter in the Southern Hemisphere (which is tilted away from it). At 10:40 p.m. EDT, the midday sun somewhere on Earth will appear above the Tropic of Cancer, a line of latitude at 23.5 degrees north of the equator. Solstice is when the days begin to get shorter and nights longer in the Northern Hemisphere. That's good news for stargazers, who can tonight celebrate the arrival of warm nights by looking for the famous Summer Triangle asterism. Look east-northeast for the stars Vega (top), Deneb (lower-left) and Altair (lower-right) — a sign not only of summer but of the location of the arc of the Milky Way. — Jamie Carter This one's likely a bit of a challenge — as always with Mercury — but if you fancy seeing the \"Swift Planet,\" then look west-northwest 45 minutes after sunset. You're looking for a slightly reddish point of light with two stars just above — Pollux and Castor in the constellation Gemini, The Twins.\" Early risers should know that from today through August 5, Venus will rise before 3 a.m. local daylight time. Catch it this morning about an hour before sunrise for a view of it beneath a 22%-illuminated waning crescent moon. — Jamie Carter Although there's a good distance between all three, looking east an hour before sunrise will get you a beautiful panorama of a 13%-illuminated waning crescent moon between a bright Venus on the right and the Pleiades open star cluster to the lower left. As well as the lovely sight of Earthshine on the moon's darkened limb, the tableau offers a good lesson in the brightness of objects in the night sky. The moon, the brightest object in the night sky, will shine at -8 magnitude, with Venus about half as bright at -4.2 magnitude, but the scale is logarithmic, with every 1 magnitude difference meaning about 2.5 times difference in brightness — so the moon will be about 33 times brighter than Venus this morning. Both will shine in the faint constellation Aries. — Jamie Carter Here comes one of the stargazing — and astrophotography — highlights of the month. However, it's not particularly convenient. Rising about 3:30 a.m. local time on the east-northeast horizon will be a slender 6%-illuminated waning crescent moon. That alone will look fabulous, but cast your eyes just above to its right and there, not half a degree away, will be the beautiful open cluster of stars called the Pleiades (also called the Seven Sisters and M45). As a bonus, Venus will be blazing away at 4.1 magnitude just to the right of the pair. — Jamie Carter Look to the eastern horizon in the predawn hours on June 20 to spot the waning crescent moon hanging in the constellation Pisces, with Saturn and Neptune to its right and the bright morning star Venus close to the horizon. This is a perfect opportunity to observe the dark basaltic plains of Mare Imbrium (Latin for the Sea of Rains) and Oceanus Procellarum (the Ocean of Storms) scarring the lunar surface. It is thought that Mare Imbrium was created in the wake of a giant impact that created a magma ocean over a thousand kilometers wide, which swiftly cooled in the frigid space environment. — Anthony Wood They may be just past their closest conjunction, but Mars and the bright star Regulus, in the constellation Leo, remain extremely close above the west immediately after dark tonight. The perfect opportunity, then, to gaze at the two and see how the red planet interferes with a popular asterism of springtime. An informal shape of stars beloved of stargazers, rather than an official constellation, the Spring Triangle consists of two stars above Mars and Regulus, Arcturus in the constellation Boötes and Spica in Virgo. If you want to make the Spring Triangle less lopsided, use Denebola — at Leo's rear-end — rather than Regulus. It's a great night to find vast asterisms like this because the moon tonight reaches its last quarter phase, rising around midnight, thus keeping the early evening night skies as dark as possible. However, with the solstice approaching, true darkness in the Northern Hemisphere is now in short supply. — Jamie Carter Although the conjunction between Mars and Regulus was at its best last night, it's virtually identical tonight, so it's worth another look. Visible above the west after dark, the conjunction is worth pondering for the contrast of colors it brings. Look carefully, and you'll see that the light from Mars is reddish (though some see a golden hue), while Regulus is more of an ice-white-blue color. Mars is named after the Roman god of war and Regulus, meaning \"king,\" is known as the \"heart of the Lion\" because it's the brightest star in the constellation Leo. They'll be less than a degree apart tonight, with Mars just above Regulus. — Jamie Carter If you've been following the passage of Mars towards Regulus, the brightest star in the constellation Leo, tonight that journey peaks. Seen above the west after dark for a few hours, the red planet and the blue star will appear to be just seven-tenths of a degree — less than the width of an outstretched little finger — apart. What's more, while Mars will shine at 1.4 magnitude, Regulus will do so at a near-identical 1.35 magnitude. — Jamie Carter Read more: How to see Mars visit a bright star and the moon this June If you're yet to get to know the small but beautiful constellation Corona Borealis, the \"Northern Crown,\" here's a good opportunity. Its lovely crescent of seven stars — found between the Boötes and Hercules constellations — is an entrancing sight in itself, but this season there's an ulterior motive. It's home to a dim star called T Coronae Borealis (also called T CrB and the \"Blaze Star\"), a nova that explodes every 80 years or so — and it's due to go nova during 2025. For its constellation, look about halfway between Arcturus and the bright star Vega high above the southeast. — Jamie Carter Stargazers have a mixed reaction to low-Earth satellites in the night sky. The sight of one streaking overhead can elicit delight in many beginners, particularly since you'll almost certainly see several more after you see one. This week, when darkness is hard to come by in the Northern Hemisphere, is the easiest time to see satellites (particularly just after sunset) simply because the sun doesn't get all that low beneath the horizon, so it's able to shine on satellites high above well after sunset. Heavens-Above is the place to find timings for satellites, notably SpaceX Starlink satellites, which are launched frequently and can sometimes be seen in swarms soon after. Just bear in mind that astronomers and astrophotographers tend to detest the Starlink constellation, which now numbers about 7,000 and routinely ruins scientific data and images of the night sky. Tonight's a good time to look for satellites because the 85%-illuminated waning gibbous moon won't rise until about two hours after sunset.— Jamie Carter We're well into the Noctilucent Clouds season, also called NLCs, which tend to appear in northern skies in June and July. They're not predictable, but they can bring a welcome dose of awe to stargazers in northern latitudes starved of true darkness at this time of year. Appearing as ghostly, wispy webs high up in Earth's atmosphere, they comprise frozen dust. Their position about 47-53 miles (76-85 kilometers) is why they shine at night, able to reflect light from the sun, which for Earthlings below is already beneath the horizon. The Kármán line — the official beginning of space — is defined as 62 miles (100 km) above sea level, which is why NLCs are sometimes called \"space clouds.\" Many mistakenly think the North Star is the brightest in the night sky. If you stood facing east last night to see the Strawberry Moon appear in a blaze of orange light, turn 90 degrees to the right after dark tonight and gaze generally north. Find the seven bright stars of the Big Dipper/The Plough, which look like a kitchen ladle or a deep spoon. It will be in the northwestern night sky with its bowl closer to the horizon. Find the two stars at the end of its bowl, Merak and Dubhe. Mentally extend the distance between the two stars four times, and you'll cross a fairly empty part of the night sky before coming across a bright-ish star. That's Polaris, the North Star. It never appears to move because Earth's northern axis is pointed virtually straight at it. The moon reaches its full phase at 3:44 a.m. EDT (0744 GMT) today. If you want the most impactful view of the full moon this month, watch the moonset early this morning, which will occur shortly before sunrise. Many hours later, the full moon will rise in an already darkened sky for those in North America. A full moon rising is at its best when it rises about 20 minutes after sunset, when the landscape is still visible and the sky is still partly lit. The celestial mechanics don't work out that well today, with sunset and moonrise separated by almost an hour. Still, any moonrise is worth watching. This one will see the Strawberry Moon about 99%-illuminated, slightly on the wane. Although tomorrow is the official date of the full moon, tonight is when to watch it emerge from beneath the southeastern horizon. That's not only because it will be 99.7%-illuminated and so very close to full, but because the celestial mechanics work out better for a good view. Named after the ripening of strawberries in the Northern Hemisphere (yes, moon names are extremely hemispheric!) — though also known as the Rose Moon, Honey Moon and Flower Moon — the time to see this full moon will be moonrise where you are. Today, sunset and moonrise almost coincide, meaning the near-full moon will rise in a fairly bright sky. It will do so in the southeast — almost as far south as the moon can rise — because of what astronomers called its once-every-19-years lunar standstill. — Jamie Carter The largest object in the night sky and one of the largest stars visible to the naked eye come head to head tonight after dark. Look to the southeast about 45 minutes after sunset and you'll see a now 98%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon, by now looking almost full, close to the red supergiant star, Antares. The brightest star in the summer constellation of Scorpius, \"The Scorpion,\" Antares will be to the lower left of the bright moon. The moon will appear just outside Scorpius's claws and later sink into the southwestern horizon, positioned just below Antares, in the gathering light of dawn. — Jamie Carter Today sees the first of three opportunities to see a conjunction between the two planets in the night sky that bear the least resemblance to each other — Jupiter and Mercury. Size-wise, it's not a fair fight — you could fit about 24,000 rocky Mercurys into gas giant Jupiter — and when it comes to brightness in the night sky, the \"Swift Planet\" usually comes off second best, too. However, today in the north-northwest, 45 minutes after sunset, the two will shine at a comparable magnitude. You'll need to find yourself a good, clear view low to the horizon, and be quick about it because the window to see these two worlds together is tight. It would also be wise to have binoculars with you (but don't use them until the sun has set). Here's a second chance to see the conjunction between Jupiter and Mercury, which will shine alongside each other for a short time in the north-northwest 45 minutes after sunset. A low view of the horizon will be necessary to see the two planets just a couple of degrees apart. If you saw a similar sight yesterday, you'll see that Mercury has risen slightly since then. That trend will continue over the next few days, with Jupiter headed the other way. The giant planet will soon drift into the sun's glare, passing behind the sun on June 24, only to re-emerge soon after in the pre-dawn morning sky. If you want to see something super-bright streak across the night sky with your naked eye, forget \"shooting stars\" and visit NASA's Spot The Station website. There, you'll find specific timings for your location for a pass overhead of the International Space Station, which can be searingly bright at this time of year from the Northern Hemisphere. That's because just after sunset, while it's dark all around you, the sun doesn't get that far beneath the horizon, so low-Earth satellites glint in the sunlight. A bright pass of the ISS at this time of year can really impress. — Jamie Carter The 77%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon will tonight shine to the right of bright star Spica, the brightest in the constellation Virgo. Look to the south after dark. Spica will be occulted by the moon early on June 6 as seen from a swathe of mostly uninhabited land in Antarctica, and the Indian Ocean — but also from the tip of southern Tasmania in Australia — according to In The Sky. — Jamie Carter The moon is an endlessly fascinating sight, but for stargazers, it begins to seriously bleach the night sky when it reaches beyond the first quarter phase. So, instead of trying to find faint constellations tonight, which will be a struggle, look again at the terminator on the moon. Thanks to the shadows it throws, this dividing line between lunar day and night tonight reveals two distinct geological features on the moon. Look at the lunar north and you'll see a semicircle of dark grey. This is the Imbrium Basin (Mare Imbrium), the moon's largest impact basin visible to us, slowly being revealed (you'll see more of it tomorrow). Look at the southern end of the terminator and you'll find the moon's Southern Highlands. — Jamie Carter The Red Planet may be well past its best, having reached its once-every-26-months bright opposition in January, but it's worth watching how it moves this month. Tonight, you can see it shining to the right of the bright star Regulus, the brightest in the constellation Leo, \"The Lion,\" which is high in the southwest after dark. Mars will get ever closer to Regulus over the next two weeks, passing closest to it on June 16 and 17. Mars will eventually reach the back of the lion-shaped constellation on June 29, just as a crescent moon slides by. — Jamie Carter Tonight at 10:41 p.m. EDT, the moon reaches its first quarter phase, when it will appear half-lit as seen from Earth. It's merely a line-of-sight phenomenon since half of the moon is always being lit by the sun — the only exception is during a total lunar eclipse, when it travels through Earth's shadow in space (the next one of those occurs on September 7-8, 2025). Tonight is a great time to look at Mare Serenitatis — the Sea of Serenity — a dark area close to the terminator (the division between day and night). — Jamie Carter Although there will be a lovely 20%-illuminated waxing crescent moon in the west immediately after sunset, tonight is a good time to turn your attention to low in the east and northeast sky, where the Summer Triangle is rising. This three-pronged shape comprises the bright stars Vega, Deneb and Altair, but each belongs to its own constellation — Lyra, Cygnus and Aquila, respectively. The later you look, the higher these three constellations will appear in a darker sky — particularly after the moon has set about two hours after sunset. — Jamie Carter No, it's not convenient, but if you're of a mind to check in on Venus as it becomes more distant from Earth on its shorter journey around the sun, this is the morning to do that. Earth's sister planet reaches its greatest elongation west before sunrise this morning, when it will be 46 degrees in angular distance from the sun. Look east anytime before sunrise. Look up 45 minutes after sunset, and you'll see a lovely conjunction with a 29%-illuminated waxing crescent moon close to Mars, with Regulus in Leo beyond. — Jamie Carter As it approaches its half-lit first quarter phase, the moon — tonight 39%-illuminated — will be between the red planet Mars and a famous blue star, Regulus, in the constellation Leo. From North America, the moon will be closest to Regulus — less than two degrees — high in the southwestern sky. They'll be best seen an hour or two after sunset. — Jamie Carter Tonight's moon will look something like a smiley face. Now 12%-illuminated, the waxing crescent moon will put on a slightly lopsided smile, with two bright stars directly above as the eyes — Castor and Pollux in the constellation Gemini. The smiley face will be on show in the west about 45 minutes after sunset and set relatively soon after, so be quick. — Jamie Carter Tonight, the moon will be a slightly larger, brighter crescent. It will be higher in the sky, having moved slightly farther along its orbital path around Earth. Now 5%-illuminated, it will shine directly above Jupiter as seen from North America, above the west-northwest horizon. You'll easily see the dark limb of the moon illuminated by reflected light from Earth's oceans, clouds and ice caps, which is named variously as \"Earthshine,\" \"planet-shine\" and \"Da Vinci glow.\" — Jamie Carter If you're quick tonight and get outside 45 minutes after sunset, you may spot a razor-thin crescent moon in the northwest. Just over 1%-illuminated, you'll likely have to use binoculars, though there is a handy marker nearby — bright planet Jupiter. Find the giant planet close to the horizon and look to its lower right. A good, clear view low to the north-western horizon will be crucial. Since it's so tiny, astronomers often call this first sighting of the crescent the 'old moon in the new moon's arms.' — Jamie Carter If you want to catch a very slim-waning crescent moon — just 11%-illuminated — this is the morning to see it. Best seen about 45 minutes before sunrise where you are, the moon will be to the left of Venus, and very close to the horizon, above due east. — Jamie Carter Another early rise? Yes — but the prize this morning is a great view of the bright center of our galaxy. Best seen about an hour before sunrise at this time of year from the Northern Hemisphere, it will be streaming down the sky, and brightest in the south. As we get closer to summer, it will become visible after midnight, and eventually after sunset in early fall. Although it's a passion of many stargazers, astronomers, and astrophotographers north of the equator to see the Milky Way each summer, the best views are always from the Southern Hemisphere. That's because the galactic central point — where the stars are densest, and the light is brightest — is located in the direction of the Southern Hemisphere. From the Northern Hemisphere, we see the ends of the spiral arms. — Jamie Carter A new moon isn't something to see per se — it's roughly between the Earth and the sun, so invisible to us — but those in coastal areas are bound to feel the effect on tides of what is technically a \"supermoon.\" Turning new at 10:02 EDT today, it's the third-closest new moon to Earth of 2025 at 223,720 miles (360,044 kilometers). With the moon out of the night sky, it's ideal for stargazing if the skies are clear — or take a star trail image, as shown above. Here's how to photograph a star trail. — Jamie Carter Here's another reason to get up about 45 minutes before sunrise. This morning, a 20%-illuminated waning crescent moon will be about four degrees from Venus, with Saturn above-right. Again, you'll need a view low to the eastern horizon and a clear sky. Look out for \"Earthshine\" on the moon's dark side. In late 2023 through mid-2024, Andreas Mogensen — the first Danish astronaut — studied Earthshine, measuring how much light reflected from the moon comes from the sun and how much is reflected from Earth. — Jamie Carter Waking up 45 minutes before sunrise is never easy, but that's the cost if you want to see some beautiful celestial panoramas this morning and through the weekend. You'll need a view low to the eastern horizon — a third-floor (or higher) window works well — as well as a clear sky. This morning, a 30%-illuminated waning crescent moon will be less than three degrees from Saturn, with Venus to the lower left, closer to the horizon. — Jamie Carter Last night's last quarter moon signals the beginning of a 10-night period when there is no bright moonlight in the pre-midnight hours. That makes them ideal for stargazing and astronomy. It's time to go learn some constellations! Start with something you know — like the Big Dipper — then come back here tomorrow to learn something new. As a reminder, the Big Dipper is an asterism — a shape of seven stars — that forms part of a bigger constellation called Ursa Major, the 'Great Bear.' — Jamie Carter You'll see thousands of images of the full moon and the half-lit first-quarter moon, but what about the \"other\" side? Images of the last quarter moon are rarer because it rises at midnight and sets at noon, as opposed to the first quarter moon, which rises at midday — and is already 'up' during twilight — and sets at midnight. Look for features on the westward face of the moon along the terminator (the line between light and shadow) including the Mare Imbrium (Sea of Rains) at the top, the large Ptolemaic crater in the center and the Montes Apenninus mountain range, the latter looking like a line of 'bubbles' at the bottom. — Jamie Carter With the waning gibbous moon rising just before midnight, you'll have most of the evening to find the summer constellation Scorpius, which the moon visited last week. Wait for Antares to appear in the southeast about two hours after sunset, then look above the red supergiant star for three bluish stars that trace the claws of the scorpion — Jaabbah (top), Acrab and Dschubba. These three stars are also known as the \"Crown of the Scorpion.\" — Jamie Carter It's faint and requires dark skies and patience to find, but Ursa Minor, \"The Little Bear\" — also known as the Little Dipper — contains one of the most famous stars in the Northern Hemisphere's night sky. Ursa Minor is a circumpolar constellation, appearing to go round and round all night. There's a reason for that. At the tip of its handle is Polaris, the North Star, which Earth's northern axis points at. At the end of its bowl are Kochab and Pherkad, two stars known as the \"Guardians of the Pole.\" The precession of Earth means that Kochab used to be close to the North Celestial Pole around 1800-1200 BCE, and will be again around 24,000 CE. — Jamie Carter Here comes perhaps the ultimate celestial signpost for stargazers each summer in the Northern Hemisphere. Look to the east a couple of hours after sunset, and you'll see, rising on its side, the glorious sight of the Summer Triangle stars. Why glorious? The Milky Way flows through this asterism (informal shape of stars) tonight as a horizontal band streaming from Deneb on the left to Altair on the right. Above is Vega. This asterism is also a study of how the brightness of stars isn't always indicative of how close they are. For example, Altair and Vega are 17 and 27 light-years distant, respectively, while Deneb is a mighty 1,500 light-years away. It's the farthest bright star. A blue-white supergiant about 200 times larger than the sun, Deneb is one of the biggest stars we know of. — Jamie Carter Go outside a couple of hours after dark, armed with some patience, and you'll have a chance to see one of the most famous constellations. However, the Hercules constellation is fainter than you might think. The core of the spider-like figure is a lopsided square of four stars known as the keystone. You'll find it by first locating bright star Vega above the east (the highest star in the Summer Triangle) and Arcturus high in the south, which you can do by going \"arc to Arcturus\" using the curve of stars in the handle of the Big Dipper. The keystone stars are about a third of the way along that line, closest to Vega. Within the square is M13, the \"Great Globular Cluster\" in Hercules — over 100,000 ancient stars orbiting in the Milky Way's halo. — Jamie Carter With the waning gibbous moon now 89%-illuminated and rising about three hours after sunset, it's a good time to find a seasonal shape of stars now prominent in the southwest right after dark. The three constituent stars are Arcturus, Spica and Regulus in the constellations Boötes, Virgo and Leo, respectively. Arcturus will be on the left, with Spica below, and Regulus off to the right. Just beyond Regulus will be Mars. — Jamie Carter Tonight, a 94% waning gibbous moon will rise in the east a couple of hours after sunset, which is a great time to get outside and watch a moonrise. Once it's up, you'll see that the top-right of the moon, as we look at it from the Northern Hemisphere, is in darkness, with the terminator — which separates day and night on the moon — slicing through some interesting terrain. The shadows will make it relatively easy to see Mare Crisium, the \"sea of crises,\" as well as some obvious craters along the top of the moon. Binoculars will give you a tremendous view. Related: Moon viewing guide: What to look for on the lunar surface Tonight, the moon meets the \"rival of Mars.\" The now 94%-illuminated waning gibbous moon will rise a couple of hours after sunset, again appearing in the south just a third of a degree (less than the width of your little finger held at arm's length) from red supergiant star Antares in the constellation Scorpius, \"the Scorpion.\" Look for Antares to the left of the moon. Its name translates to \"rival of Ares\" (Ares means Mars), not only because of its reddish color but also because it sits close to the ecliptic, so the red planet passes close to it every few years. About 550 light-years from the solar system, Antares has another nickname — the \"Scorpion's Heart.\" — Jamie Carter At 11:56 a.m. EDT today, 100% of the moon will be illuminated by the sun — a full moon. The best time to watch May's \"Flower Moon\" will be moonrise where you are (which is specific to your location), where you can watch it come up from beneath the southeastern horizon. Thanks to Raleigh scattering, there's a short period of about 15 minutes where a full moon is a muted orange, then pale yellow. It's a great time to look at the moon with your naked eyes or a pair of binoculars. Once it's risen high into the sky, it will quickly become too bright to look at comfortably. — Jamie Carter A full moon is coming, but before it arrives, our natural satellite will pass closely to another key bright star of the spring night sky in the Northern Hemisphere. About 94%-illuminated, the waxing gibbous moon will sit about half a degree (less than the width of your little finger held at arm's length) from Spica, which may appear as one point of light but is actually the combined light of two blue giant stars in a binary star system. It's about 250 light-years from the solar system. The moon will be easy to see in the southeast even before sunset, with Spica appearing on its lower left during twilight. — Jamie Carter It may be 400,000 times less bright than the sun, but it's often very easy to see the moon during the day. At first quarter, it rises at noon and sets at midnight, while at full moon a week later it rises at sunset and sets at sunrise. In between, it's big, bright, and high in the southeast all afternoon. Today, it will become very obvious in the east about an hour before sunset in the west, and dominate the dusk. — Jamie Carter Expert moon watchers will tell you not to look at the moon only when it's full or near-full, as it is tonight at 99.5% illuminated. That's true — studying features along the terminator, the dividing line between light and shadow, is the way to go — but looking at the entire Earth-facing side does give you a sense of lunar geography. The most prominent feature is its many maria — seas of ancient lava. Lava flows formed these darker areas on the lunar surface during its formation. It's also worth considering that the moon looks \"upside down\" when viewed from the Southern Hemisphere, where the moon — which roughly follows the sun's path through the sky — appears in the northern sky. — Jamie Carter If you're going to be a stargazer and navigate the night sky, you need to know about Arcturus. A red giant star 37 light-years from the solar system is easy to find — and not just because it's the fourth-brightest star in the night sky. Just follow the stars of the Big Dipper's handle to go in an \"arc to Arcturus\" in the east, towards — but not as far as — the 89%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon in the southeast. The constellation that Arcturus is part of, Boötes \"The Herdsman,\" is to the left of the star. Given that the Big Dipper is part of the constellation Ursa Major, \"The Great Bear,\" it's perhaps not surprising that Arcturus means \"Guardian of the Bear.\" — Jamie Carter It’s one of the official 88 constellations, and it’s easy to see in the night sky, so why is the kite-shaped constellation Corvus “The Crow” so little known? In the southern sky immediately after dark and below the 82%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon, its five main constituent stars — Gienah, Kraz, Algorab, Minkar and Alchiba — should be relatively easy to find just to the right of bright star Spica. If not, come back in a week when the moon will be out of the sky. — Jamie Carter Today, it’s exactly two years since King Charles III was coronated. So why not find a star (kinda) named after him, Cor Caroli? Meaning “Charles’s Heart,” Cor Caroli is actually named after King Charles I or II — nobody is quite sure which one. Anytime after dark, look north for the Big Dipper. Find the star at the end of its handle, Alkaid, then go directly above about the same length as the handle. Part of the two-star constellation Canes Venatici, Cor Caroli is a binary star system about 110 light-years from the solar system. Tonight, it’s around a third of the way between Alkaid and the 74%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon in the east. — Jamie Carter Once the moon has reached about a third-lit, it begins to become bright and less interesting to see with the naked eye. However, it's worth looking for tonight because it will form a nice triangle with a planet and a star. Now 34%-illuminated and visible from sunset until midnight, it will hang below Mars and to the upper-right of Procyon, the eighth-brightest star in the night sky and the brightest (and only notable) star in the constellation Canis Minor. — Jamie Carter At 45%-illuminated, the moon is tonight perilously close to reaching its First Quarter phase, where its brightness begins to bleach the light sky. However, tonight, it should be a target for skywatchers as it is very close to Mars. Its exact position will depend on where you are and when you look, but from many locations, the moon will be perched just above Mars — a stunning sight! If you have a pair of binoculars, it will get even better, because Mars will be beside the stunning Beehive Cluster open cluster of stars. — Jamie Carter Tonight, the moon reaches its first quarter phase, which makes all but the brightest stars harder to see. So why not focus on those brightest stars? Look to the west about 45 minutes after sunset, and you'll see bright Jupiter due west. High to its right side will be bright Capella in Auriga, the \"Goat Star,\" while to its lower left will be Betelgeuse in Orion and, closer to the horizon, Sirius in Canis Major. The four will together form a cosmic curve above the western horizon. — Jamie Carter Now 24%-illuminated, the waxing crescent moon will tonight hang roughly halfway between Mars, to its upper left and Jupiter, to its lower right. Look to the western sky from about 45 minutes after sunset. — Jamie Carter Tonight is your second chance in a row to see a waxing crescent moon shining close to bright Jupiter. This time, the moon will be 14%-illuminated and appear just above Jupiter. They'll be roughly equidistant between two bright stars, Betelgeuse in Orion to the lower left and bright Capella in Auriga to the upper right. — Jamie Carter Here's the first of two successive opportunities to see the beautiful crescent moon visit the biggest planet in the solar system. Look to the western sky about 45 minutes after sunset, and you'll see a 7%-illuminated waxing crescent moon approaching Jupiter, shining at mag. 2. The two will form a triangle with red supergiant star Aldebaran below, the brightest star in the constellation Taurus, which Jupiter is currently residing within. — Jamie Carter Look to your east this morning about 45 minutes before sunrise, and you'll see a beautiful planetary view. The most obvious world will be Venus, which will shine at mag. -4.4, though barely two degrees below it will be Saturn shining at mag. 1.2. That makes Venus 174 times brighter than Saturn tonight. If you're lucky, you may also see Mercury much closer to the horizon, due east. For a bonus sight, be outside shortly after sunset, and you will stand a slim chance of seeing a very slender crescent moon just above the western horizon. Since it will be 2%-illuminated, this is going to be a challenging observation, but it is possible to see such a slim moon. Although you may be able to see it with the naked eye, a pair of binoculars will help hugely, particularly because the beautiful Pleiades open cluster of stars will be positioned just above the crescent moon. — Jamie Carter If you've only got the time, energy or inclination to get up before sunrise just once this month to do astronomy, make it this morning. About 45 minutes before sunrise in the east an 8% illuminated waning crescent moon will form a tight equilateral triangle with Venus and Saturn, with no more than a couple of degrees between all three solar system bodies. It's undoubtedly the observing and astrophotography highlight of the week and, arguably, the month. Look carefully; you may see Mercury below the crescent moon, shining at mag. 0.4. — Jamie Carter Here's an interesting bright star to bright planet hop that won't be possible in the evening sky for much longer. Be outside shortly after sunset, looking west, and you should easily be able to pick out the planet Jupiter, shining at mag. -1.9 in the constellation Taurus. To its lower left will be Betelgeuse, a mag. -0.5 reddish star directly above the unmistakable three stars of Orion's Belt. Go the same distance again toward the southwest, and you'll come to Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky at mag. -1. Its name means \"lit\" in Latin, but it's referred to as the \"Dog Star\" since it's the brightest in the constellation Canis Major, the \"big dog.\" — Jamie Carter If you were wowed by Venus in the post-sunset night sky for much of the first half of 2025, prepare to be dazzled once again — but only if you get up very early. Looking east 45 minutes before sunrise will allow you to see Venus shining at a brilliant mag. -4.5, the brightest it will get its new apparition as the \"Morning Star.\" If you have a small telescope, train it on Venus, and you'll be treated to the intriguing view of the cloudy planet as a 26%-illuminated crescent, a consequence of its position between Earth and the sun and its current closeness to Earth. Today, we also have a new moon — when our natural satellite is roughly between Earth and the sun. A new moon is completely invisible to us unless there is a solar eclipse, as there was last month. However, there is something special about this new moon, which happens to be the closest of the year, effectively making it a \"supermoon,\" though that colloquial name is usually more commonly used to refer only to the closest full moons of the year. — Jamie Carter Here's another chance to see a fine conjunction of Venus and an even slimmer crescent moon. Look at the east about 45 minutes before sunrise and you'll see a 16%-illuminated waning crescent moon approaching Venus, shining at -4.4 mag. above Saturn at mag. 1.2. The three solar system bodies will form an elongated triangle on its side. — Jamie Carter Celestial mechanics this month means that beautiful planetary views require some dedication. While for much of the year the planets have been post-sunset events, Venus and Saturn have now moved to the pre-dawn morning sky. This morning, about 45 minutes before sunrise, look to the east-southeast, and you'll see a 26% illuminated waning crescent moon to the right side of Venus, which will be shining at mag. -4.4 above the far dimmer Saturn, at mag. 1.2 — Jamie Carter Long after the sun has risen, then sunk, get outside to see the peak of the Lyrids, a medium-strength meteor shower caused by dust and debris left in the inner solar system by comet Thatcher (C/1861). According to the American Meteor Society, expect about 18 \"shooting stars\" per hour at the peak, which will occur in daylight — so get outside as soon as it gets dark. A bright waning crescent moon, now 40%-illuminated, won't rise until well after midnight. — Jamie Carter Although the peak of the annual Lyrid meteor shower isn't until tomorrow night, according to the American Meteor Society, this medium-strength shower typically produces good rates of \"shooting stars\" for three nights centered on the maximum. So tonight is a good night for a stargazing session, clear skies allowing, as is Tuesday, April 22 and Wednesday, April 23. — Jamie Carter Read more: The Lyrids are back: How to catch this year's spring meteor shower If you're stargazing into the wee hours tonight, in the northeast you'll see some familiar summer stars rise — Vega, Deneb and Altair, which make up the popular Summer Triangle asterism. Deneb, beneath Vega, is in the constellation Cygnus, which depicts a figure resembling a flying swan. However, turn it on its head, it's known as something else entirely — the Northern Cross. Deneb acts at the top of the cross, which appears on its side tonight. — Jamie Carter If you missed Mercury as an easy post-sunset target in early March, here's another chance to catch the \"Swift Planet.\" Although it will shine at only mag. 0.3, it should be possible to see Mercury in twilight by looking east about 45 minutes before sunrise. Today, it reaches its highest altitude in the morning sky, so it is farthest from the sun as seen from Earth. — Jamie Carter If you need any more proof that the meteor shower season has arrived, tonight, Earth will bust through a cloud of dust and debris left in the inner solar system by none other than Halley's Comet. Although the peak night, when an impressive 50 \"shooting stars\" per hour can be expected, won't occur until Saturday, May 3 through Sunday, May 4, the Eta Aquariids meteor shower begins tonight. Primarily a Southern Hemisphere shower, expect to see a few swift meteors emanating from the constellation Aquarius, which rises in the east just before dawn in the Northern Hemisphere. — Jamie Carter The Lyrid meteor shower season has begun. Although the night skies are always buzzing with sporadic shooting stars, the Lyrid meteor shower is the first dense concentration of them since January's Quadrantids. Although it won't peak until Tuesday, April 22, through Wednesday, April 23, the Lyrid meteor shower is active from April 16 through April 26. Expect a handful of \"shooting stars\" per hour, with a good chance of bright fireballs. — Jamie Carter What latitude do you live at? You can easily tell by using Polaris. Go outside after dark and look north, locating Polaris. Now, measure how high Polaris is above the horizon using your fists on outstretched arms held up to the sky. Three fists? You're 30 degrees north of the equator. Four fists? 40 degrees. You get the idea. Three outstretched fingers span about five degrees, and an outstretched little finger spans a single degree. This basic system works because humans are all built to scale. That means anyone can measure apparent distance in the night sky using their fists and fingers. — Jamie Carter Here are some stars visible year-round, which is why they're known to almost everyone. Riding particularly high this month are the seven bright stars of the Big Dipper/Plough, circumpolar stars that appear to revolve around Polaris, the North Star, every 24 hours. You can use the two stars on the left of the bowl of the Big Dipper/Plough to easily find Polaris. Trace a line from Dubhe through Alkaid and keep going down to the horizon until you come to the only bright star you can see in the region of the sky. That's Polaris — that's due north. — Jamie Carter Look due east for perhaps the definitive constellation of spring in the Northern Hemisphere. Boötes — which means \"the herdsman\" — is centered on a bright star called Arcturus, a red supergiant star only about 37 light-years distant. It's above the east shortly after dark. Look to its left and make a rough \"Y\" shape. The constellation has other faint stars, but the \"Y\" — which also looks like a champagne glass — is the easiest way to see and remember it. — Jamie Carter With the moon now behind it — literally — it's a good time to find and familiarise yourself with the constellation Leo. The most obvious shape to look for is the \"sickle\" of Leo, resembling a backward question mark that uses the constellation's brightest star, Regulus, as the period. Denebola marks the tip of the lion's tail. — Jamie Carter A full moon is best viewed when it rises in the east about 20-30 minutes after the sun has set in the west. That way, its delicate, orangey light can be seen appearing above a landscape that still has some residual twilight illuminating it. However, it doesn't always work out that way. Tonight, for North America, the full moon rises almost exactly at sunset, meaning it will look rather pale and lack the drama of appearing in a twilight sky. As recompense, it will appear very close to one of the most famous stars in the night sky, Spica in Virgo. Watch it at 8:23 p.m. EDT and you'll catch the exact moment of the full moon. From most of South America, the full moon will occult (cover up) Spica for a short time, according to In-The-Sky.org. — Jamie Carter There isn't a good night to see the full moon rise this month for Europe, but tonight is the next best thing. Although it will no longer be close to Spica, the just-past-full moon will appear in the east about an hour after sunset. Incidentally, the 'Pink Moon' is also called the 'Pascal Moon' this month because it helps determine the date of Easter Sunday. According to the Western Christian church, Easter falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon on or after the spring equinox. — Jamie Carter Mars has been in the constellation of Gemini for many months, appearing to move one way, then the other, thanks to our point of view of the red planet from Earth. It will appear to form a straight line tonight with \"the twins\" of Gemini, Castor and Pollux, after dark. Although it's an optical alignment that has been apparent for at least a few nights and will continue for a few more, it's tonight when it's at its most perfect. — Jamie Carter Here's a nice asterism (the shape of stars, not an official constellation) that can only be seen in spring and summer. The Diamond of Virgo is formed by Arcturus in the constellation Boötes, Spica in Virgo, Denebola in Leo and Cor Caroli in Canes Venatici. This region of the sky includes a wealth of galaxies. — Jamie Carter Where you look in the night sky is instructive. Tonight, look towards the western horizon after dark and see the constellation of Orion and the other winter stars sinking into the haze. The stars you see are part of the Orion Arm, a spiral arm of our Milky Way galaxy. Now look to the south for Leo, which covers the \"realm of the galaxies.\" You've just turned your gaze from looking into our galaxy to looking away from it and into deep space. Stargazing is geography on the grandest scale. — Jamie Carter Tonight, a 79%-illuminated waning crescent moon will shine in the constellation Leo, a famous spring shape of stars now clearly visible after dark. The moon will be close to Regulus, one of the brightest stars in the night sky and about 77 light-years from the solar system. Its nicknames include \"Heart of the Lion\" and \"Little King.\" Look high in the southeast anytime after dark. — Jamie Carter Tonight, the moon reaches its first quarter phase, which is seen as half-lit from our point of view. It’s now rising around midday, setting around midnight, and beginning to bleach the night sky, making faint objects harder to see. Its position tonight at the feet of the constellation Gemini — about two-thirds of the way between Jupiter and Mars (closest to it) — makes it ideal for use as an aid to finding the bright stars Capella (to the right of the moon) and Betelgeuse (below the moon). — Jamie Carter Tonight, there's the pretty sight of a reasonably bright Mars (mag. 0.5) — noticeably still emitting a rosy, reddish or golden light — shining next to a now 60%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon. The two solar system objects will be about two degrees from each other. Look directly above the pair, and you'll see bright stars. That's Pollux (closest to the moon and Mars) and Castor (farthest), the so-called \"twins\" of the constellation Gemini. Pollux, 34 light-years distant, will look distinctly yellowish and will form a triangle with the moon and Mars tonight. Add Castor, which is 51 light-years distant and makes an upside-down Y-shape. The moon may be getting bright in the post-sunset night sky, but there's something you should look at before it’s gone for six months. Containing — and close to — some of the very brightest stars and most impressive stars in the night sky, Orion is perhaps the most famous constellation of all. Tonight in the west, the iconic Orion's Belt will appear horizontal, with Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka — the \"Three Kings\" — prominent. Below them will be bright blue Rigel, with ruddy Betelgeuse above. Follow Orion's Belt to the south, and you'll come to Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. — Jamie Carter Tonight is another chance for a mini “planet parade,” with a now 38%-illuminated waxing crescent moon shining roughly equidistant between Jupiter and Mars. The red planet, shining at mag. 0.5, will be above the moon, with mag. -2 Jupiter below it. Look southwest anytime after sunset. — Jamie Yesterday, the Pleiades were visited by a delicate waxing crescent moon in one of the most spectacular stargazing sights of the year so far (see photo below). Tonight, it’s the turn of Jupiter, shining at mag -2.1, with the giant planet and a now 27%-illuminated crescent moon to appear together in the constellation Taurus in the post-sunset western sky. They’ll be separated by about five degrees, so this isn’t a super-close conjunction, but it will be a beautiful sight. — Jamie Carter Andy Moran captured this stunning view of the waxing crescent moon shining below the Pleiades on April 1. The moon's darker portion is beautifully illuminated by earthshine, a soft glow created by sunlight reflecting off Earth's surface. Editor's note: If you capture an astronomy photo and would like to share it with Space.com's readers, send your photo(s), comments, and your name and location to spacephotos@space.com. It may be April Fools’ Day, but believe us when we say that tonight’s passage of a slim waxing crescent moon through one of the most beautiful objects in the night sky will have astrophotographers out in full force. High in the west after sunset, a 17%-illuminated waxing crescent moon will be about half a degree above the Pleiades, an open cluster of stars around 440 light-years distant. Close by, Jupiter will be easily visible, shining at mag. -2.1. — Jamie Carter If yesterday’s attempt at seeing the slimmest possible waxing crescent moon failed, try again tonight when it will now be 9%-illuminated and a little easier to see. If you can see Orion's Belt—three horizontal stars sting above the southwest—follow them in a straight line to the right. Look slightly below that imaginary line when you get to due west. — Jamie Carter Here's another final hurrah for a staple of the winter night sky in the Northern Hemisphere — catch it while you can! Look to the south after dark, and you’ll easily spot Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, pointed at by the three stars of Orion's Belt nearby. To the upper-left of Sirius is Procyon in Canis Minor, and to its upper-right is Betelgeuse in Orion. As luck would have it, you can go equidistant beyond Procyon to Mars and from Betelgeuse to Jupiter. — Jamie Carter Here comes a partial solar eclipse for the entire western hemisphere north of the equator. It will be visible at sunrise from eastern North America and in mid-morning across Western Europe, with the former seeing as much as 94% of the sun blocked by the moon and the latter a lot less. Those along the eastern coast of North America, specifically northeastern U.S. states (such as New England and Maine) and eastern and southeastern Canada (Quebec and New Brunswick) are on the sunrise line. It's taking place exactly one lunar year (12 orbits of the moon around Earth) since a total solar eclipse across North America on April 8, 2024. Everyone will need proper eye protection — eclipse glasses and solar filters for all cameras and binoculars — at all times. — Jamie Carter Editor's You can also keep up with the latest solar eclipse news and events with our solar eclipse live blog. Related: — What time is the partial solar eclipse on Monday? — Partial solar eclipse 2025 livestreams: Watch online for free Here’s a challenge for every stargazer who likes to see something almost nobody else ever does. Be outside looking west immediately after sunset, and you’ll have a chance to glimpse a 3%-illuminated waxing crescent moon, just a day past it crossing the sun to cause a solar eclipse. It will be close to the western horizon — almost directly below bright Jupiter—but it will be dim, so you may need a pair of binoculars. British stargazers wanting to remain punctual should also know that in the U.K., the clocks go forward by an hour. — Jamie Carter Here’s a good night to spot two very bright stars in the night sky by indulging in one of the most famous star hops. Start with Arcturus, the brightest star in the constellation Boötes, which is now rising in the east as the sun sets in the west — a sure sign that spring has arrived. Find the curve of stars that make up the handle of the Big Dipper/Plough above the northeast, and travel in an arc until you come to a very bright reddish, bright star. That’s Arcturus, the fourth brightest in the night sky, whose name means “Guardian of the Bear” since it follows Ursa Major (location of the big Dipper/the Plough) across the sky. Now go across the horizon to Spica, a bright blueish star in Virgo, another springtime star in the Northern Hemisphere. — Jamie Carter Look west as the sky darkens, and there, laid out in front of you, will be the last vestiges of the winter night sky. Face west and cast your eyes from the Monoceros constellation in the southwest to the Cassiopeia constellation in the northwest. You’ll see some of the most famous constellations and, as luck would have it, a couple of bright planets laid over a glowing star field — the winter Milky Way. Due west will be Jupiter, with the bright star Aldebaran and the Pleiades star cluster just below it. Above it, to the right, will be Capella in Auriga, and to the left, Mars. To Jupiter’s left will be the bright stars of Orion and, beyond it, Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. Find somewhere without light pollution and savor a final view before these gems soon sink into the western horizon. — Jamie Carter Corona Borealis (Northern Crown) is a slight but beautiful curve of seven stars that’s currently famous as the home of T Coronae Borealis (also called T CrB and the \"Blaze Star\"), a nova that explodes every 80 years or so. T CrB was expected to explode between April and September 2024 and will likely explode during 2025. To find it between the Boötes and Hercules constellations, look for the Big Dipper in the northern sky and follow its handle to go \"“arc to Arcturus,\" a common star-hop for stargazers. Arcturus is in the east. Now find bright Vega, low in the northeast. Corona Borealis is about halfway between the two. — Jamie Carter Read more: Is the 'Blaze Star' about to explode? If it does, here's where to look in March Here's a lovely target to look for, particularly if you have really dark skies. One of the closest and brightest open star clusters visible to the naked eye — but not as easy to see as the Pleiades — the Beehive Cluster (also called M44) is home to hundreds of stars. Greek astronomer Ptolemy described it as the \"Little Cloud,\" which is very much what it looks like. It's in the dim and uninteresting Cancer constellation between Leo and Gemini. — Jamie Carter Editor's note: Sign up for our NEW skywatching newsletter \"Night Sky This Week\" to discover this week's must-see night sky events, moon phases, and stunning astrophotos. Looking east after dark tonight will raise a question. To the south will be the bright star Sirius, but what’s that backward question mark shape to its left? It’s the \"sickle\" of Leo, an asterism that makes up the front of the Leo constellation. The dot is Regulus, the constellation’s brightest star, with the tip of the sickle — also the lion's head — a star called Algenubi. At the other end of the constellation is the star Denebola, which represents the tip of the lion’s tail. Although it’s beyond the reach of the naked eye, between Regulus and Denebola is the M96 or Leo I Group of galaxies, a cluster of nine galaxies. When you look in the direction of Leo, you’re looking away from the bright stars of the Milky Way and out into the universe beyond. Stargazers, get ready! With the moon today reaching its last (or third) quarter phase, it rises half-lit around midnight. Beyond tonight, it rises as a crescent ever later, clearing the night sky of moonlight. However, there is a good reason to stay up until midnight to watch the moon rise because it will do so at its southernmost declination of 2025. Look north after dark and find the familiar constellations of Cassiopeia and the Big Dipper, with Polaris — the North Star — between them. Now look about halfway between Polaris and the lowest star in Cassiopeia's \"W\" or \"M\" for a bright star. This is Errai, a once and future North Star because of the precession of Earth’s axis (a predictable phase cycle that takes place over 22,000 years). It’s also the top of the faint Cepheus constellation, named after a Greek mythological king. It looks more like how a child might draw a house, with Errai as the highest point of a pitched roof. Below it are four stars that roughly form a square. Dark country skies will help with this one. — Jamie Carter At precisely 09:00 UTC (05:00 a.m. EDT) is the vernal equinox (equi is Latin for equal, nox for night), which sees roughly 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night everywhere on Earth. With Earth’s tilted axis side-on to the sun, it also sees the beginning of spring in the Northern Hemisphere and autumn in the Southern Hemisphere. The sun rises due east and sets due west on the equinox, an event that causes shadows to shift either side, marked by ancient monuments including Chichén Itzá, Mexico, where seven triangular shadows move down the steps of the Pyramid of Kukulcán in an event called the “descent of the serpent.” — Jamie Carter Read more: Spring equinox 2025: Say goodbye to winter in the Northern Hemisphere today The sky is full of constellations, many of them esoteric and hard to find, but there are plenty of easy-to-locate asterisms — unofficial shapes of stars — that make it much easier to learn the night sky. Top of the list in March has to be the Spring Triangle, a simple equilateral shape that joins the bright stars Arcturus in the constellation Boötes, Spica in Virgo and Denebola in Leo. You'll find them in the southwest sky. — Jamie Carter You know how to find the Big Dipper/Plough in the northern sky, but what about its parent constellation, Ursa Major? The Big Dipper/Plough is seven stars that make the unmistakable shape of a handle and a cup, but it's merely the tail and hindquarters of Ursa Major — the \"Great Bear.\" Trace out the stars of this vast, famous, yet usually ignored constellation, and you'll be one of very few who can. Late March is the ideal time to do so since Ursa Major is high in the sky, hence the memory aid \"spring up, fall down.\" — Jamie Carter It's one of the most spectacular naked eye sights in the winter night sky, but the Pleiades — also called the Seven Sisters and M45 — will soon sink into the western horizon shortly after sunset. The stars of the Pleiades feature in the lore of many cultures, often symbolizing good fortune, navigation and protection. The ancient Greeks linked its appearance to agricultural prosperity; in Japan (where it’s called Subaru), it's related to guidance and harmony, and in Navajo culture, it's a symbol of unity and order in the universe. It's also a sight that’s better looked at with the naked-eye than through a telescope. Read more: The Pleiades: Facts about the \"Seven Sisters\" star cluster It's only four days since Venus and Mercury were in conjunction, but there’s an extra reason to grab any glimpse of Venus — before it’s gone completely from the post-sunset night sky. Get as low a view of the western horizon as possible, and you may see bright Venus close to a dim Mercury to its left. Both inner planets have phases — just as the moon does, as seen from Earth — because they are inner planets. Venus is barreling towards Earth, getting closest next week as it travels through the sun’s glare and transits to the pre-dawn morning sky. It’s now a mere 4%-lit, a lovely sight in a small telescope or a large pair of binoculars just after the sun has set. Venus remains so bright, despite being only slightly illuminated, because it’s close to Earth — and its disk relatively larger in our sky — but also because it’s covered in a layer of very reflective clouds. — Jamie Carter From today until the end of the month, it is a good time to be somewhere exceptionally dark at sunset. With the near-full moon out of the immediate post-sunset sky—and rising about 50 minutes later each night—the stage is set for a display of zodiacal light. Sunshine reflects dust in the solar system, and zodiacal light is seen as a subtle triangle of light during twilight above the sunset point on the western horizon. You’ll need to be somewhere as far from light pollution as possible. As the bright waxing gibbous moon rises in the east a few hours after sunset, bright star Spica will shine a few degrees underneath it. The 16th brightest star in the night sky, Spica, is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo. Its rising is a sure sign that spring is coming to the Northern Hemisphere. About 250 light-years from the sun, Spica is a double-star system, with two stars that orbit each other every four days. — Jamie Carter With no total lunar eclipse visible since 2022, stargazers will be out in force for this relatively rare and always spectacular event. It’s arguably one of the most enjoyable and relaxing cosmic spectacles of all, with the lunar surface turning a reddish-orange-pinkish color for a leisurely 65 minutes. Read more: What time is the 'Blood Moon' total lunar eclipse tonight? Although it's visible in part from the entire night side of Earth, the best views will be from North America, from where totality —a.k.a. the “blood moon” moment—will occur at these times across North America: — 2:26-3:31 a.m. EST on Friday, March 14, 2025 — 1:26-2:31 a.m. CST on Friday, March 14, 2025 — 00:26-1:31 a.m. MST on Friday, March 14, 2025 — 11:26 p.m. on PST Thursday, March 13, 2025, to 00:31 a.m. on Friday, March 14, 2025 — 10:26-11:31 p.m. AKST on Thursday, March 13, 2025 — 8:26-9:31 p.m. HST on Thursday, March 13, 2025 However, it’s worth being outside about 75 minutes before these times to see the partial phase, where Earth’s shadow creeps across the lunar surface. In Europe, the best views will be had just before moonset on Friday, March 14, 2025. You can watch the lunar eclipse online here on Space.com and catch up with the latest lunar eclipse news and events with our lunar eclipse live blog. Read more: Total lunar eclipse March 2025 — When and where to see the next 'Blood Moon' lunar eclipse Can you find the \"North Star?\" Earth's northern axis points at Polaris, hence its name, each night, as seen from the Northern Hemisphere. It appears never to move for any one location — and it's easy to find. Tonight, the Big Dipper is in the northeast, its bowl highest in the sky a couple of hours after dark. Just find the two stars at the outer edge of the Big Dipper's bowl—Dubhe and Merak. Now go in a straight line connecting these two stars, traveling to the left (toward due north) about five times the distance between them and you get to Polaris at the tip of the handle of the smaller, dimmer Little Dipper. The altitude of Polaris above the northern horizon is hugely valuable to navigators because it corresponds to the observer’s latitude on Earth. The farther north you travel from the equator, the higher it becomes until you reach the North Pole, where Polaris will be directly above you. For example, if Polaris is 40 degrees above the horizon, you're at 40 degrees latitude. You can measure the altitude of Polaris by using an outstretched arm against the sky—three fingers are equivalent to five degrees, and a fist is 10 degrees. — Jamie Carter Tonight’s almost full moon, now 95%-illuminated, shines just a couple of degrees from Regulus in the constellation Leo, one of the 20 brightest stars in the night sky at mag. +1.3. Known as the \"Heart of the Lion,\" Regulus means \"little king\" in Latin. It was deemed a \"Royal Star\" by the Babylonians and Persians, along with Aldebaran, Antares and Antares. About 79 light-years from Earth, Regulus is rising in the eastern sky shortly after sunset every night this month — a sure sign that spring is coming in the Northern Hemisphere. — Jamie Carter It’s time to say goodbye to Venus. After many months of it dominating the post-sunset night sky, it’s on the verge of disappearing. However, it goes out with a flourish, paired with its little sister Mercury tonight after sunset. Look due west for the two inner planets, but do it quickly because they’ll only be visible for about 45 minutes from 30 minutes after sunset. You can try for the same sight for the next week or so, but it will get more challenging each night as both planets head into the sun's glare. — Jamie Carter Tonight, you'll see a similar scene to last night, with a waxing gibbous moon — now 64%-lit — roughly between Mars, on its left, and Jupiter, on its right. Just beyond Mars are Pollux and Castor in Gemini, while just below Jupiter is Aldebaran in Taurus. However, there is also something slightly unusual about the moon tonight, which will reach its northernmost position in 2025. — Jamie Carter If you're going to look for Mercury once in 2025, make it tonight. Today, the inner planet Mercury reaches its easternmost elongation, about 18 degrees from the sun, which puts it at its highest altitude in the post-sunset sky. It's only going to shine at -0.3 magnitude, but it will be worth looking for above due west for about an hour after sunset. Venus will shine above it. Once you've spotted it, about-turn to face southeast for the lovely sight of a 74%-lit waxing gibbous moon just a couple of degrees from reddish-golden Mars. — Jamie Carter This morning at 02:00 a.m., local time saw the clocks go ahead (“spring toward, fall back”) for one hour in North America, signaling the beginning of daylight saving time. Fittingly, it’s also a good night to see another seasonal clock in the sky. Look due north after sunset. On the left, you’ll see the W-shape of stars called Cassiopeia, and on the right will be the seven stars of the Big Dipper, the latter part of the Ursa Major constellation. After sunset in March, they are positioned exactly as you see them, but in September, they’re on opposite sides. That’s because both are circumpolar constellations. Since they are on either side of Polaris, the North Star (which you can see shining between them), their positions shift throughout the night due to Earth’s rotation. — Jamie Carter Tonight, it’s the first quarter moon, traditionally the time stargazers stop looking for faint constellations and objects and instead focus on looking for bright stars and planets. That’s because the moon’s visibly half-lit surface begins to reflect a lot of glare around the night sky. Lucky for stargazers, the moon — shining brightly in the south after sunset — is tonight surrounded by spectacularly bright objects, with Jupiter just five degrees from it and Mars slightly farther to the left. Below, you’ll see the bright stars Betelgeuse and Rigel on either side of Orion’s belt, with Sirius — the brightest star in the night sky — below, above due south, with Procyon above. — Jamie Carter The moon will move across or close to the Pleiades open cluster of stars during every orbit of Earth this year. Tonight, Ash Wednesday, isn't one of the best in 2025 since it passes just half a degree from the Pleiades during daylight in North America. By the time the sky is dark, a 42%-illuminated waxing crescent moon will sit a couple of degrees above the Pleiades, about halfway between it and Jupiter in the constellation Taurus. The Pleiades will be positioned midway between the moon and Uranus beneath, though the seventh planet will be near-impossible to see unless you have incredibly dark skies (and excellent eyesight). — Jamie Carter With the vernal equinox coming up in a few weeks, the time is now for a possible “equinoctal effect” on the northern lights. With Earth’s axis perpendicular to the sun and its solar wind — a stream of charged particles — Earth’s magnetic field is slightly weakened. The result is that the solar wind has more of an effect on Earth’s magnetosphere—the region of space where its magnetic field dominates — often causing a noticeable uptick in aurora. According to the Russell-McPherron Effect, cracks also open up in the magnetosphere, letting in more charged particles. In short, if you experience any geomagnetic storm predicted by NOAA this month, it could well be stronger and cause more aurora than is typical. — Jamie Carter Read more: Why March is the best month to see the northern lights Editor's note: Keep up to date with the latest northern lights forecasts and alerts with our aurora live blog. There could be some unsettled conditions over the coming days! Look west immediately after sunset, and you may have a chance of seeing tiny Mercury poking above the horizon. It’s rising, so it will become easier through Saturday, March 8, but tonight is a good time to start looking for it. However, the big drawcard in the post-sunset night sky is still Venus, which tonight shines brightly at mag. -4.4 immediately above Mercury. Don’t take views of Venus for granted because it’s now rapidly sinking into the horizon and will soon be gone from the post-sunset sky. A 20%-illuminated crescent moon will be above the pair, with Jupiter beyond. — Jamie Carter Look west for a slim crescent moon as soon as it is dark. It will be about 6%-illuminated, so it won't be easy to see below Venus. Patience will be required (and perhaps a pair of binoculars). Venus will be shining at a brilliant magnitude of -4.8. — Jamie Carter Here's an easier target than last night — a crescent moon higher in the sky alongside a brilliantly bright planet. As soon as it gets dark, look due west, and you'll quickly see a 12%-illuminated waxing crescent moon above Venus. Look carefully at the dark side of the moon's limb, and you may see some subtle light. That's Earthshine, sunlight reflected by Earth's clouds and remaining ice caps onto the lunar surface. — Jamie Carter Shining brightly at magnitude -2.3, Jupiter still dominates the post-sunset sky in the east. This week passes close to Aldebaran, the brightest star in the constellation Taurus, the bull. This magnitude 0.8 star, an orange supergiant star, is known as the 'eye of the bull,' but its name translates as \"the follower\" in Arabic because it's positioned close to the Pleiades open cluster of stars, which you'll see close to Aldebaran and Jupiter. — Jamie Carter It may be one of the most famous constellations, but Perseus, the hero, is not an easy shape of stars to pick out in the night sky. Go out soon after sunset and find brilliant Venus in the west and bright Jupiter in the east. Perseus can be found roughly halfway between them, above you, but more to the northern side of the night sky as seen from the Northern Hemisphere. A vague V-shape of stars, Perseus features a prominent curve of right stars, with the brightest being Mirfak and Algol, the latter known as a \"winking demon\" because it's two stars orbiting each other, one of which blocks the other regularly. The demon star follows a precise cycle of brightening and dimming, completing one full pattern every 2 days, 20 hours, and 49 minutes. In 2024, astronomers using the new Euclid telescope discovered over 1,500 billion intracluster stars outside the 100,000 galaxies in Perseus, appearing to wander the cosmos. Yesterday, Mars stopped going backward. Since Dec. 6, 2024, it has been appearing to travel westward across the night sky as it brightened, a consequence of its getting very close to Earth. Tonight, that so-called retrograde motion ceases, with the red planet continuing on its apparent prograde path and eastward motion across the stars. It's been moving further into the constellation Gemini, close to bright stars Castor and Pollux. It's there tonight, but starting tonight, it will begin to exit and move back toward the constellation Leo. — Jamie Carter Here's a great excuse to watch a sunset at the beach. If there are clear skies where you are, find yourself a west-facing coast — or anywhere else that gives you a good view low to the western horizon — and remain in place once the sun has set. Bright Venus, at magnitude +4.9, will become almost instantly visible high above the sunset point, but keep your eyes peeled, and you'll see much dimmer Saturn and Mercury, at magnitude 1.1 and 1.2, respectively, barely a degree apart. Saturn will be on the left, and Mercury on the right. — Jamie Carter With the moon down, the next week is perfect for spotting some of winter's best constellations before they fade. One of the faintest but most worth finding is Cancer. A mere Y-shape of stars between Gemini and Leo, Cancer is easy to find in the east tonight, halfway between Pollux in Gemini and Regulus in Leo, below. Within Cancer is the Beehive Cluster (M44), which you can see with the naked eye under (really) dark skies far from light pollution. — Jamie Carter High in the sky this month, you'll find a bevy of bright stars, one of the brightest of which is Capella. Known as the \"Goat Star\" in antiquity, Capella is the brightest star in the constellation Auriga, the charioteer. This week, It can be found making a square shape with Betelgeuse in Orion and the planets Jupiter and Mars. — Jamie Carter The last quarter moon is tonight, and our natural satellite is seen rising half-lit around midnight. Over the next week, it will wane to a slim crescent moon, rising later each night. This period is ideal for stargazing because the night skies will become increasingly dark. Light pollution in cities may be rampant and increasing, but it's surprising how few people know that the real culprit for bleached night skies is, in fact, a bright moon. — Jamie Carter It's an awkwardly timed sight for most, but if you can stay up very late or get up very early, there's a chance to see the moon rise in the southeast with one of the prettiest stars. Red supergiant star Antares, which translates as 'rival of Mars' because of its ruddy hues, will be barely a degree above the 44%-illuminated waning crescent moon. Antares, the heart of the constellation Scorpius, sits over the bright central core of our Milky Way galaxy. — Jamie Carter Tonight, Venus — shining at a brilliant magnitude -4.9 as the \"Evening Star\" — will be closest to the sun, something astronomers call perihelion. It's got the most circular of all the planets, according to In-The-Sky.org, so it's particularly noticeable, but take any excuse to look at Earth's sister planet while you still can. It's now a few days past its brightest, but it's perfectly placed for seeing dominate the western sky immediately after sunset. If you have a small telescope, point it at Venus, and you'll see that it's a 28%-illuminated crescent. That can only happen to the two inner planets, Venus and Mercury, as seen from Earth. — Jamie Carter You've read the hype around supermoons, but what about the opposite? While a supermoon is an astrological term for a perigee moon — when the moon is closest to Earth, so bigger in the sky — but there isn't a name for the opposite scenario. Tonight sees what might be termed a 'mini-moon' — an apogee moon, the moon at its farthest point from Earth. Now a waning gibbous moon, it will rise about three hours after sunset and appear slightly smaller than its average size. — Jamie Carter If you're in a dark location, far from light pollution, look west about an hour after sunset for a subtle triangle of light above the sunset point. A subtle but unmistakable sight, this so-called zodiacal light is photons reflected by dust particles in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. It should be visible until the moon appears in the post-sunset sky again on Feb. 28, 2025. — Jamie Carter Since the best moonsets occur in the west before sunrise, few observers pay any attention. However, there's something special on offer this morning in the shape of Spica, which will be even closer than last night. The blueish star, about 250 light-years from the solar system, will appear just a degree above a 79%-illuminated waning gibbous moon. — Jamie Carter There is no better month to look at the stars of Taurus, one of the most famous and beautiful constellations in the night sky. The key to finding Taurus is identifying reddish Aldebaran and then locating the stars' V-shape around it. There's a light to help guide the way at present — bright Jupiter, an interloper that just happens to be passing through Taurus. Beyond Jupiter are Elnath and Tianguan, the points of the bull's horns. However hard you want to learn the stars of Taurus, your eyes will likely be drawn to the sparkling open cluster of stars nearby — the Pleiades or Seven Sisters. — Jamie Carter There isn't just one night in 2025 to observe Venus. However, Feb. 16 will offer an exceptional view because the \"evening star\" will be at its closest point to Earth. It will shine at an apparent magnitude of -4.9. A couple of hours after Venus has set in the west a couple of hours after sunset, an 81%-illuminated waning gibbous moon will appear in the east just above Spica, the brightest star in the constellation Virgo. — Jamie Carter 'Spring up, fall down' is how to remember where the Big Dipper is during the year. So what about winter? Look to the north tonight a couple of hours after dark, and you'll see the Big Dipper rising on its side. At the top will be the bowl stars, Dubhe and Merak, with Alkaid at the tip of the handle lower on the horizon. Go to the left from Dubhe and Merak and you'll come to Polaris, the North Star, which Earth's northern axis points straight at. Go to the left, and you'll come to Cassiopeia, the W-shaped constellation of seven stars. Both the Big Dipper and Cassiopeia are circumpolar, eternally spinning around Polaris from our point of view. — Jamie Carter Today at 13:52 UTC (8:52 a.m. EST), our satellite officially reaches its full phase, with Earth positioned roughly between it and the sun. It will be best viewed as it rises above the eastern horizon during dusk at the time of moonrise where you are, with the bright star Regulus in Leo just to its right. During the next full moon, on March 13, the moon's positioning will be more precise, with the full Worm moon passing through Earth's dark umbral shadow in space to cause a total lunar eclipse — the first anywhere on the planet since 2022. North and South America will have the best views. — Jamie Carter Read more: Total lunar eclipse March 2025: When and where to see the next 'Blood Moon' lunar eclipse It's often overlooked because of more famous shapes of stars nearby, but knowing how to find Canis Major, the great dog, should be a stargazing staple. Not least because it's so easy to find its brightest star, Sirius, the \"Dog Star.\" At just 8.6 light-years from the solar system, it's the closest and brightest star visible above the equator, shining at a magnitude of -1.4. Orion's belt points straight at it, low on the southern horizon as seen from the Northern Hemisphere. Although they're much dimmer than Sirius, see if you can pick out the other tars in Canis Major — notably Adhara, Wezen and Aludra. — Jamie Carter Can you see the galaxy in 3D? Look east after sunset, and you’ll find a 97%-illuminated waning gibbous moon shining brightly. Above it will be Mars, and to its right will be Procyon, the brightest star in the Canis Minor constellation. The moon is a mere 238,606 miles (384,000 kilometers) from Earth, Mars about 153 million miles (246 million km) and Procyon 11.4 light-years. Procyon is one of the closest stars, yet the moon is approximately 0.000000356% as far from Earth as Procyon, and Mars is about 0.000228% as far away. The solar system may seem vast, but stars are incredibly far away. — Jamie Carter For an hour after sunset tonight, look to the west, and you’ll see bright Venus — now shining at a magnitude -4.8 — just to the lower-left of a large square of four bright stars of roughly equal brightness at each of the four corners. That’s the Great Square of Pegasus, the core shape of the constellation Pegasus, a winged horse of Greek mythology. The four stars are Scheat, Alpheratz, Markab and Algenib, with Venus visible close to the latter two. Below Venus will be Saturn, shining at a far dimmer magnitude of 1.1. — Jamie Carter The constellation Orion, the hunter, rides high in February. Look directly east after dark tonight, and you’ll immediately see a bright 86%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon. Go to the right, and you’ll quickly come to Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka, the three bright stars that make up Orion’s Belt. Between the belt stars and the moon is reddish Betelgeuse, while beyond them is bluish Rigel. — Jamie Carter Look to the east as soon as it gets dark, and you’ll see a 93%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon between golden-colored Mars on its right and bright star Pollux on its left. Pollux, the brightest star in the constellation Gemini and 34 light-years distant, has an orangey color while Mars, despite being the ‘red planet,’ will have a distinctly golden hue. Tonight, it’s 109 million kilometers from Earth. — Jamie Carter Look to the southeast as soon as it gets dark, and you’ll see a 68%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon above two bright points of light. The closest to it is Jupiter, now shining at -2.5 magnitude, with Aldebaran below. About 66 light-years from the solar system, Aldebaran is a red supergiant star and the “eye of the bull” in the constellation Taurus. — Jamie Carter A 57%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon will pass close to the Pleiades open star cluster tonight. It will create a picturesque scene in the night sky that astrophotographers can return to again every month during 2025. Two bright points of light — Jupiter and bright star Aldebaran — will be beneath the moon and the Pleiades. — Jamie Carter Overnight tonight, the moon will reach its first quarter phase, which will see its right half illuminated from Earth’s point of view. A first-quarter moon rises around midday and sets around midnight, so this is when the early evening skies get bleached by moonlight. Stargazing will become more difficult until the moon reaches its last quarter phase on Feb. 20, when it will rise around midnight and set around midday. — Jamie Carter The night sky tonight is at something of a crossroads. It’s now a day past a cross-quarter day called Candlemas in the Christian religion that marks the sun’s midway point between the winter solstice and the spring equinox. However, there’s one marker of the night sky that may appear to be season but is anything but. Look south after sunset; you’ll see a 34%-illuminated crescent moon shining brightly. Venus will be between it and the southwestern horizon, shining at magnitude -4.8. It’s been this way for a few months, but don’t take the sight of Venus after sunset for granted. At its brightest in the evening sky from Jan. 28 through Feb. 27 in 2025, it will reach its greatest brilliancy on Feb. 14. However, it will quickly sink into the western horizon as it disappears into the sun’s glare by mid-March. Venus has no annual pattern as seen from Earth. That’s because, as an inner planet, it orbits faster than Earth — just over 13 times for every eight orbits by Earth. It, therefore, has a cycle of Earth visibility that repeats every eight Earth years. Just beyond Venus will be a much dimmer Saturn. — Jamie Carter Look to the southwest immediately after sunset, and you'll see a beautiful conjunction of a 7%-illuminated waxing crescent moon and Saturn emerging in the twilight. The two will be separated by barely a degree. Saturn will, at +1.1 magnitude, be relatively dim. So it may take substantial darkness to see it. — Jamie Carter If you thought yesterday's conjunction of the crescent moon and Saturn was spectacular, wait until you see tonight's sight. Venus will blaze away in the southwest after sunset, shining at -4.7 magnitude. Just two degrees to the left will be a 14%-illuminated waxing crescent moon. Venus is now just two weeks from being the brightest it will get during its current apparition as the \"Evening Star.\" — Jamie Carter Tonight, the waxing crescent moon, now 23%-illuminated, will be visible high above bright Venus. However, it will remain a terrific sight, with its darkened limb lit up by \"Earthshine\" — sunlight reflected from Earth's oceans, snow and ice back onto the moon. High above the trio will be bright Jupiter and, beyond it, Mars. — Jamie Carter This won't be easy, and you may need binoculars but don't miss the chance — if the skies are clear — to glimpse a young waxing crescent moon emerging from the sun's glare. It will be visible briefly as a very slim crescent just after sunset when just over 2.5% of its surface is lit by the sun. Look to the west about 15 minutes after the sun dips beneath the horizon. — Jamie Carter At 7:36 a.m. EST today, the moon will slip roughly between Earth and the sun, completing its orbit and entering its new moon phase. There's nothing to see because the moon will be lost in the sun's glare and there's no eclipse (that will next happen on Mar. 29), but there is a reason for stargazers to celebrate. Not only will the lack of moonlight at night make skies as dark as possible, but the next four or so evenings will feature a beautifully slim waxing crescent moon in the post-sunset sky. Check for a clear sky, grab a warm coat and spend at least 20 minutes outside to allow your eyes to adjust to the dark. — Jamie Carter Tomorrow's new moon will signal the beginning of the Lunar New Year (also called Chinese New Year) and Year of the Snake, which will continue through Feb. 16, 2026, when the Year of the Horse begins. Draco, the dragon, is a faint shape of stars that traces a serpent's tail between the constellations of Hercules, Cepheus, Ursa Minor and Ursa Major. Look north as late as you can tonight to find its tail zigzagging between Polaris, the North Star, and the Big Dipper. — Jamie Carter Look to the southwest after dark and find Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. You can do that by finding the easily recognizable stars of Orion's Belt and following a line through them to the horizon. Once you have Sirius in your sights, look for Procyon, the brightest star in Canis Minor, to its left. Now look for reddish Betelgeuse, in Orion, above them. Join them together to make an isosceles triangle — the Winter Triangle — which will be visible until April. — Jamie Carter Antares is a red supergiant star in the constellation Scorpius. To the naked eye, it looks orangey-red (which is easiest to see if you squint at it). Its name means \"rival of Mars\" because the red planet sometimes passes close to it, confusing skywatchers. The two won't get close until September 2025, so there'll be no mistaking them this morning before sunrise when a 26%-illuminated waning crescent moon shines 0.3 degrees from Antares. — Jamie Carter You'll have noticed by now this month that there are a lot of planets around and that there's also a lot of hype about it. Look west after sunset, and you'll find Venus and Saturn, with Jupiter high in the south and Mars above the east. They're the naked-eye planets, but there will be a couple of other dim telescopic worlds weaved into the \"planet parade,\" too, namely Uranus close to Jupiter and Neptune near Venus. Ignore the hype about them being \"lined up.\" All planets orbit the ecliptic — the path of the sun across our sky — so they are always visible in something of a line across the sky. — Jamie Carter Ask any stargazer or astrophotographer for the best time to see and image the Milky Way; they'll tell you from April through November. That's the time to see its bright center, but if you want to see its spiral arms — and the Orion Arm in particular — January is the best month. Ever wondered why you can see so many more bright stars from the Northern Hemisphere in winter than in summer? It's because the solar system is part of the Orion Arm, and during winter, we get a great view of it and see much closer, brighter stars. It may not have the brightness of the summer Milky Way, but on a dark night, you can see a faint band of white light — the combined glow of billions of stars — across the winter sky. — Jamie Carter This month is ideal for observing Mars. All month, it will shine at -1.3 magnitude around the constellation Gemini. Tonight, it gets closest to one of its stars. Look about two degrees to its left, and you'll see orangey Pollux, the brightest star in Gemini. Pollux is just 34 light-years from the solar system. Just above, and forming a triangle with the pair, will be slightly dimmer, blue-white Castor, 52 light-years from the solar system. The contrast in colors — the golden color of Mars, the orange of Pollux and the blue-white of Castor — will provide a spectacular view. If you can't see the colors easily, squint at the stars until you do. In stargazing, patience and perseverance are everything. — Jamie Carter This month, stargazers will be fixated on the constellation Orion, which will be prominent in the southeast after dark. It's hard to take your eyes off it; its stars are just so bright and, in the case of the three stars in Orion's Belt, so perfectly aligned as seen from Earth. Look on the other side of those three stars, and you'll see two of winter's most impressive stars — Betelgeuse and Rigel. They're found on opposite sides of Orion's Belt. Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star 548 light-years away. Almost 800 light-years away, Rigel is a blue-white supergiant star and the brightest star in Orion. Both will eventually go supernova. — Jamie Carter The moon regularly appears to pass near several bright stars each month, including Aldebaran, Pollux, Regulus, Antares and Spica. However, rarely are the apparent passes as close as tonight's conjunction of a waning gibbous moon and Spica. Look to the east from the early hours until sunrise, and you'll see an almost half-lit moon just 0.1 of a degree from the brightest star in the constellation of Virgo. During 2025, the moon will pass very close to it every month. At 3:31 p.m. EST today, the moon will reach its last quarter phase, which will rise at midnight and set at midday. — Jamie Carter At this time of year, all eyes turn to the Orion constellation. Its bright stars are just too much to ignore. However, look below it, and you'll find another far less familiar constellation. Becoming visible late at night as Orion rises higher in the sky, look immediately underneath the brightest star in Orion, blue-white Rigel, and keep to the right of dazzling Sirius. You'll find 11 stars that make the shape of a rabbit. The second and sixth planets from the sun will begin a two-night conjunction tonight, but you'll have to quickly see it after sunset because the two planets will sink below the horizon soon after. Venus will shine at -4.6 magnitude in the southwest after sunset and be easy to find. Look about two degrees to its left, and you'll find a much dimmer Saturn shining at +1.1 magnitude. If it's cloudy, don't worry — there's another chance tomorrow. — Jamie Carter Read more: Venus and Saturn take a sunset stroll tonight. Here's how to see it The conjunction of Venus and Saturn continues tonight as the sky darkens at sunset, this time with Saturn below Venus as the planets edge along their orbital paths. The two planets will once again be about two degrees from each other. With Saturn inching closer to the sun (it will be at solar conjunction on March 12) and Venus still rising, a close conjunction of the two planets was inevitable. — Jamie Carter What's the brightest star in the night sky? That's easy — go outside tonight a couple of hours after sunset, and you'll see it with your own eyes. In the east below Orion's stars will be Sirius, the brightest star in Canis Major. Just 8.6 light-years from the solar system, it's the fifth closest star system known and one of the sun's nearest neighbors. Shining at -1.45 magnitude, it shouldn't be hard to find. If you struggle, here's a tip — Orion's Belt points almost straight down at it. — Jamie Carter Now 89%-illuminated, the waning gibbous moon will rise late at night and be positioned close to Regulus, the brightest star in the constellation Leo and just 79 light-years from the solar system. They'll appear to be about two degrees from each other, with Regulus above the moon. — Jamie Carter One of the best-known constellations in the northern sky, the winged horse, Pegasus, is visible just above the planets Venus and Saturn after dark this month. Look directly above the pair for bright star Algenib and then search for the other three stars that make up the \"Great Square of Pegasus\" — Alpheratz (right), Scheat (top) and Markab (bottom). The horse's legs splay out to the right from Scheat, while bright star Enif, to the right of Venus and Saturn, is the horse's muzzle. Enif is an orange supergiant star about 12 times as massive as the sun and 690 light-years from the solar system. — Jamie Carter The first full moon of 2025, the \"Wolf Moon,\" will move across and block the planet Mars tonight. Moreover, Mars will be shining at the brightest it will get during a four-year period. Now at -1.4 magnitude, the red planet will be hidden by the moon, as seen only from North America, between 8:44 p.m. EST and ending at 00:52 a.m. EST on Tuesday, Jan. 14. The exact times of ht planet's ingress (disseverance) and egress (re-appearance) will depend on your location, for which In-the-sky.org provides a map. Regardless of geography, everyone worldwide will be able to watch the \"Wolf Moon\" appear on the eastern horizon during dusk today. — Jamie Carter Venus gradually gets higher and brighter in the sky as it approaches Earth. Tonight, it reaches its greatest elongation east — it is farthest from the sun in its current apparition, as seen from Earth. It will be positioned 47.2 degrees from the sun and will be visible above west-southwest for about three hours after sunset. You'll find a dimmer Saturn to its left. — Jamie Carter A dichotomy — or division — of the second planet from the sun occurs today as its phase resembles the moon in its first and last quarter. Precisely half-lit tonight, just a couple of days after it appeared highest in the post-sunset sky, Venus will henceforth shrink from a half-moon shape as it retreats into the sun's glare on Mar. 20. — Jamie Carter Tonight, Mars will make its closest approach to Earth since Dec. 8, 2022. Now moving through the constellation Cancer, it's just days away from being 100%-illuminated by the sun as seen from Earth, an occasion called opposition by astronomers. It will be 59,703,891 miles (96,084,099 kilometers) distant tonight and shine at an impressively bright -1.4 magnitude. — Jamie Carter One of the closest open clusters of stars to the solar system, the Pleiades (or \"Seven Sisters\"), is in the constellation of Taurus and positioned close to the ecliptic, the sun's path through the sky. Since the moon orbits relatively close to the ecliptic, it must pass across the Pleiades regularly for a short period every six or so years. In 2025, it will do just that, with this first of many similar conjunctions this year seeing an 80%-illuminated waxing gibbous moon pass less than a degree from the center of the Pleiades. Look southeast anytime after dark for the pair, though binoculars will give you the best view. — Jamie Carter Three stars that you'll have no trouble finding in the glare of the waxing gibbous moon are Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka, a trio of stars comprising the famous asterism (shape of stars) called Orion's Belt. Situated at the core of the constellation of Orion, the hunter, they shine at 1.8-magnitude, 1.7-magnitude and 2.4-magnitude, respectively, and will be visible above the southeast. — Jamie Carter Look high in the south after dark tonight for the bright planet Jupiter shining at -2.7 magnitude. It’s directly above orange-reddish star Aldebaran, whose name means “eye of the bull,” and slightly to the left of the Pleiades, an open cluster of stars. The stars of a looser-looking open cluster of stars, the Hyades, surround Aldebaran. See if you can make out the constellation Taurus, the bull, specifically the tips of the bull’s horns, beyond Jupiter — Elnath (top) and Tianguan (bottom). — Jamie Carter Tonight at 6:56 EST, the moon will reach its first quarter phase, which will see it half-lit from Earth’s point of view. A first-quarter moon rises around midday and sets around midnight, so this is when the early evening skies get bleached by moonlight. Stargazing will become more difficult until the moon reaches its last quarter phase on Jan. 21, when it will rise around midnight and set around midday. — Jamie Carter Now 18%-illuminated, the waxing crescent moon will shine less than two degrees from Venus in the eastern sky after dark and Saturn above the moon. As you watch the trio sink toward the horizon, watch for fireballs from the first meteor shower of the year. About 120 shooting stars per hour — some very bright — can sometimes be seen from the peak of the Quadrantids, which happens right after dark. They're caused by dust and debris left in the inner solar system by a comet or asteroid (astronomers aren't sure which) called 2003 EH1. — Jamie Carter Tonight the waxing crescent moon, now 28%-illuminated, will shine just above Saturn, with Venus shining brightly below. Prepare for plenty more sights like this in 2025, with some terrifically close moon-Venus conjunctions coming up in the early months as the second planet from the sun reaches its brilliant best. — Jamie Carter Look to the southwest after dark, and you'll see a now 39%-illuminated waxing crescent moon high above Saturn and Venus below. The ringed planet will shine at mag. 1 while Venus will be at mag. -4.5, near to the brightest it will get in its current apparition as the \"Evening Star.\" — Jamie Carter A 10%-illuminated waxing crescent moon will be below bright Venus tonight, with Saturn farther above. The moon will set soon after, so don't waste time taking in this one. — Jamie Carter It's been an exceptional year for stargazers, from April 8's total solar eclipse and global auroras to a comet and much more. Why not ponder all that — and look forward to the celestial delights of 2025 — by looking south shortly before midnight? You'll see the winter night sky at its very best, with this region of sky containing the stars of Orion, the Orion Nebula, the Pleiades, bright Sirus and, of course, both Jupiter and Mars. — Jamie Carter Here's a great way to ring in a new year of sky-watching. Get somewhere with a low view of the southwest horizon and wait for sunset. Once the sun has dipped below the horizon, look for a 5%-illuminated waxing crescent moon. You may need binoculars to spot its slim against a blueish twilight sky. Be quick because the moon will set soon after sunset. Venus and Saturn will be far above. — Jamie Carter Today at 5:38 p.m. EST is a New Moon, which makes tonight perfect for stargazing. Look to the southwest soon after sunset, and you'll see two bright planets, Saturn and Venus, very close together, with the ringed planet a few degrees above. Look to the left of Venus, and you'll find bright star Fomalhaut, the brightest in the constellation Piscis Austrinus, the Southern Fish, forming a triangle with the two solar system objects. A double star about 25 light-years behind the two planets, Fomalhaut is one of the four Royal Stars of ancient Persian culture, which calls it the \"Watcher of the South.\" — Jamie Carter If you're up and looking low to the southeastern horizon about an hour before sunrise, you'll come across a lovely tableau of a 12%-illuminated waning crescent moon approaching Mercury, which will shine at mag. -0.3 this morning. Antares, the brightest and reddest star in the constellation Scorpius, will be almost between the two. If you want to catch a super-slim-waning crescent moon, with just 6% of its surface lit by the sun, be up and looking to the southeast an hour before sunrise. As a bonus, it will shine just a fraction of a degree from reddish Antares. Look to the southeast after dark for Mars, now shining brightly at mag. -1.2, then high above to its right for Jupiter, at a brighter mag. -2.8. Now come down to the horizon for Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, which always shines at -1.45, so a little brighter than Mars tonight. The three should form a triangle. As well as being the brightest points of light in that part of the night sky, they're also the closest. Every other star you can see in the sky tonight is far behind these three — though Sirius, at 8.6 light-years distant, is a lot farther away than the planets. If you've received a telescope or a pair of binoculars for Christmas, there's only one thing to put them on as soon as it gets dark. Found to the lower right of Orion's Belt in the eastern sky, the Orion Nebula — also called M42 — is a star nursery about 1,300 light-years from the solar system. Although it looks spectacular in optics, it's also visible to the naked eye; look just to the side of it to appreciate its brightness in your peripheral vision. What's more impressive — a bearded man delivering presents to the world's children in one night or a human-built space station traveling faster than a speeding bullet 250 miles above? Either way, you can see the International Space Station fly across the sky frequently if you know when and where to look. Check NASA's Spot The Station website to see if you can see the ISS this Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. What you tell the kids is up to you. — Jamie Carter Read more: Could that be Santa's sleigh? Early risers can spot the ISS from the UK this Christmas Three stars will be prominent above the southeast after dark — Orion's Belt. These three stars — Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka — can be used to find other, arguably more important stars nearby. Take an imaginary line from the top of the belt to the bottom and keep going towards the horizon, and you'll come to an unmistakably bright, blueish star. Sirius is one of the closest stars to the solar system at 8.6 light-years. It's also the brightest star in the night sky, with a mag. of −1.46. — Jamie Carter If you're up early on Christmas Eve, look to the southeast for a glimpse of the waning crescent moon, now 35%-illuminated, less than a degree from Spica, the brightest star in the constellation Virgo and about 261 light-years from the solar system. Below the pair, due southeast, Mercury and reddish star Antares will rise shortly before the sun. Today at 4:17 a.m. EST is the solstice, the longest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere and the shortest in the Southern Hemisphere. The sun won't rise in the Arctic Circle, and in the Antarctic Circle, it won't set. It's all down to Earth's axis being tilted by 23.5º relative to the plane of Earth's orbit around the sun. You can see solstice: glance at the sun today around midday, and it will be the lowest it gets in the year. — Jamie Carter It's the Last Quarter Moon tonight, which sees the moon rise around midnight. Long before that, just before sunrise, it may be possible to spot Mercury. The elusive inner planet is typically close to the sun but occasionally rises high enough into the sky to be seen from Earth. This morning, it reaches its highest point of its current apparition, shining at mag. -0.2. Don't confuse it with Antares, the brightest star in the constellation Scorpius, which will be a little dimmer at mag. 0.9, but has a similarly reddish color. We see the peak of the Ursid meteor shower tonight, but the presence of a waning gibbous moon — which will rise into the night sky before midnight — will make its five to 10 meteors per hour hard to see. — Jamie Carter It's perhaps the most famous constellation in the night sky, but how well do you know Orion, the hunter? Let's start with its three bright \"belt\" stars — Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka — aligned vertically above the east as darkness sets in tonight. Now, find the four bright stars at their corners. Left of the belt stars is reddish Betelgeuse, with Rigel on its right. Above the belt stars is Bellatrix, and below is Saiph. Find those, and you'll also notice a fuzzy glowing object between the belt star, Saiph and Rigel. That's the Orion Nebula, also called M42, where stars are being born. — Jamie Carter Look anytime from the small hours through dawn, and you'll see, moving from southeast to southwest, a 73%-illuminated waning gibbous moon just a couple of degrees from Regulus, the brightest star in the constellation Leo, the lion. It's 78 light-years distant and the 21st brightest star in the night sky. — Jamie Carter Look to the east about four hours after sunset, and you'll see a bright waning gibbous moon, now 84%-illuminated, hanging below Mars. Above the pair will be the bright stars Pollux and Castor in Gemini. Together, the four will form a crescent of four lights that get steadily dimmer as you go further from the moon. — Jamie Carter Look east a few hours after dark, and you'll easily see a 90% illuminated waning gibbous moon. Just a degree or so below will be red Mars, shining brightly at mag. -1 as it approaches its bright opposition in January. The planet will pass closest to Earth on Jan. 12, 2025, and align with Earth and the sun four days later. — Jamie Carter The now-waning gibbous moon might bleach the sky, but the stars are so bright in the east this month after dark that you should have no problem completing this star-hop. First, look for the three bright stars of Orion's Belt, lined up vertically above the eastern horizon a couple of hours after sunset. On the left will be the reddish giant Betelgeuse, and on the right will be the blueish giant Rigel. Draw an imaginary line from Rigel through the belt stars to two bright stars arranged vertically, Castor and Pollux in Gemini. Tonight, the moon, which both stars are to the left of, gives you a helping hand. As a bonus, Mars will be shining below Gemini. — Jamie Carter Its up to 120 meteors per hour make it officially the year's most prolific meteor shower, yet the Geminids will underperform in 2024. You can thank the waxing gibbous moon, which will be 97% illuminated tonight and so bleach the sky. It will, therefore, be tricky to see any but the brightest colorful shooting stars produced as Earth smashes into the trail of debris left in the inner solar system by asteroid 3200 Phaethon. — Jamie Carter Read more: Geminid meteor shower peaks tonight! Here's how to see one of the best meteor showers of the year Editor's note: You can also watch the Geminid meteor shower live online from the comfort of your own home courtesy of Astronomer Gianluca Masi of the Virtual Telescope Project. The livestream is scheduled to start at 6:00 p.m. EST (2300 GMT) on Dec. 13, weather permitting. Now on the cusp of being a full moon, our natural satellite glides past the constellation Taurus tonight. As it does so, it will align with bright Jupiter and orangey-reddish supergiant star Aldebaran, the brightest star in Taurus and about 65 light-years from our sun. — Jamie Carter Rising in the east during dusk will be one of the month's most dramatic and beautiful celestial sights of the month — the full \"Cold Moon.\" Also known as the \"Moon Before Yule\" and the \"Long Nights Moon,\" it will turn full at 4:01 a.m. EST. As a bonus, as the full moon rises, it will form an equilateral triangle with Jupiter above its right and bright red supergiant stars Betelgeuse to its lower right. — Jamie Carter The glare of the waxing gibbous moon, 92% illuminated tonight, is now washing out many faint stars. However, between the moon and the eastern horizon, you can easily pick out bright Jupiter shining at mag. -2.4. To its right will be Aldebaran in Taurus, but the spectacular open star cluster of the Pleiades will be between the giant planet and the moon. — Jamie Carter It's one of the most famous asterisms (a shape of stars, but not an official constellation) in the summer night sky, but tonight the Summer Triangle continues its post-sunset farewell with an extra point of light. Look southwest shortly after sunset, and you'll see Deneb in Cygnus (top), bright Vega in Lyra (below Deneb), and Altair in Aquila (left of Vega) form their usual triangle. This unmistakable shape of stars all this week points like an arrow at Venus, shining at mag -4.2 above southwest. — Jamie Carter Look southeast after dark, and you'll see the bright planet Jupiter. Tonight, use it as a guiding light to find one of the night sky's most spectacular sights — the Pleiades. Pronounced \"Plee-err-deez,\" this open cluster of seven bright stars (or six to older eyes) shine together in the constellation Taurus. Also known as \"Seven Sisters\" and M45, the Pleiades are all hot, young stars a mere 445 light-years away from the solar system. Their intense starlight illuminates clouds of gas and dust between them. Get the Pleiades in your peripheral vision to appreciate their collective brightness. — Jamie Carter Look east after sunset tonight for the bright planet Jupiter shining at mag. -2.8. It's firmly in the clutches of the constellation Taurus, \"the bull.\" Just to Jupiter's right will be orange-reddish star Aldebaran, whose name means \"eye of the bull.\" Around Aldebaran, you'll see a smattering of stars in a V-shape. That's the Hyades, one of the closest open clusters of stars to the solar system, at around 150 light-years. — Jamie Carter Look to the southwest after dark, and you'll see a beautifully balanced panorama of the waxing crescent moon, now 32%-illuminated, flanked by two of the solar system's most beautiful planets. Below the moon will be Venus, shining brightly at mag. -4.1, while above will be Saturn, the ringed planet, at mag 1. Just beyond Saturn, but hidden to the naked eye, will be the dim seventh planet Neptune. — Jamie Carter Jupiter will rise gloriously in the east after dark tonight as soon as the sun sets in the west. It's a special day for the \"King of Planets\" because, as seen from Earth, it reaches opposition, the night when Earth passes between it and the sun. The planet's disk will be 100% illuminated as seen from Earth, and Jupiter will look at its brightest and best for all of 2024. If you have binoculars, you'll be able to see some of its four Galilean moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. If you have a small telescope, you'll see its colorful cloud belts. Don't worry if it's cloudy — because Jupiter will be bright and visible all night for the rest of the month. — Jamie Carter In the southern sky after dark, you'll find a half-lit moon at its first quarter phase when its entire right-hand side (from the Northern Hemisphere) is illuminated. Look for three dark patches in a row on the moon's lit side — ancient lava pains called maria — called the \"seas\" of Serenity, Tranquility and Fertility. Just below and to the right will be Saturn, shining at mag. 1. — Jamie Carter Here's another spectacular sight of the crescent moon and Venus together for a third night. Although not in as close a conjunction as yesterday, tonight, the waxing crescent moon — now 22%-illuminated — will shine to the upper-left of Venus. More views of the waxing crescent moon and Venus are coming early in 2025. — Jamie Carter Last night Kevin McCarthy captured this beautiful photograph of the moon and Venus from Charlotte, North Carolina, U.S. You should be able to catch a similar view tonight where Venus will appear to the moon's lower right, pending clear skies! \"The pairing just as the sun set allowed some blue to remain in the sky at the time I took this shot. I think that adds to the photo instead of the normal pitch-black background,\" McCarthy told Space.com in an email. — Daisy Dobrijevic Now 14%-illuminated, the waxing crescent moon will today shine just a couple of degrees from Venus in the eastern sky after dark. The planet is brightening as it gets closer to Earth, though paradoxically, less of its disk is on show. Tonight, it's in a 66%-illuminated gibbous phase and shines at mag. -4.2, but by February, it will become a 13%-illuminated crescent yet shine at mag. -4.8. It will shine more brightly despite less of its disk being lit by the sun for two reasons — it will be much closer, and the clouds in its atmosphere reflect a lot of light. — Jamie Carter Look to the southwest an hour after sunset, and you'll see a 7%-illuminated waxing crescent moon in Sagittarius, just below bright Venus. The moon will set soon after, so don't waste time. — Jamie Carter After yesterday's\" New Cold Moon,\" the skies will be dark and perfect for stargazing. Look to the northeast, and you'll see Jupiter shining at magnitude -2.8, one of the brightest lights in the night sky. To its upper-left will be Capella, the brightest star in the constellation Auriga. Going anti-clockwise from Capella, see if you can pick out the constellation's four other bright stars — Menkalinan, Mahisim, Elnath and Hassaleh — circling toward Jupiter and back. — Jamie Carter Today, it's Native American Heritage Day in the U.S., an excellent opportunity to see and interpret the night sky in a way familiar to Indigenous people in North America. It's not an exact science because there are multiple Indigenous tribes and cultures, but one familiar shape of stars in the night sky is the Western constellation of Orion. Centered on the three bright stars that make up the famous Orion's Belt, which rises in the east about three hours after sunset tonight — is Átsé Ets'ózí (First Slim One), a male image in Najavo culture that uses Orion's Sword as a knee. In Ojibwe culture, the stars Procyon in Canis Minor and Aldebaran in Taurus are added to form a vast figure called Biboonkeonini (The Wintermaker). — Jamie Carter Related: The Native American night sky: 7 starry sights to see As we reach the end of November, Mars becomes a pre-midnight object. Get outside and look to the east shortly before that time. The red planet rises below a panorama of bright stars, including Betelgeuse, Rigel, Orion's belt, Capella and Sirius. However, closer to it, you'll see it make a triangle shape with Procyon in the constellation Canis Minor (the eighth-brightest star in the night sky), to its right and above, the bright golden star Pollux in Gemini. — Jamie Carter With a new moon imminent, it's the perfect moonless night to get a grip on one of the largest and most impressive star-hops possible to make in Earth's night sky. Get outside after 10:00 p.m. local time and look to the southeast for a mess of bright stars. Make a circle (or hexagon?) out of them, going anti-clockwise from the bottom. First, find Sirus — the brightest star in the night sky — then go above-right to Rigel in Orion, to the right of the hunter's three belt stars. Now go up to orangey Aldebaran (don't confuse it with interloper Jupiter), then above-left to Capella high in the sky, then directly down to two stars together, Pollux and Castor in Gemini. Now go below-right to Procyon (ignoring Mars, just outside the circle)and below-right again back to Sirius. Practice finding and naming these stars, and you can level up your stargazing knowledge. — Jamie Carter A delicate crescent moon will grace the night sky about two hours before sunrise today — Thanksgiving in the U.S. Just 7%-illuminated, it will rise in the east and sine below bright stars Spica (above) and Arcturus (above and left). Use a pair of binoculars to see \"Earthshine\" — sunlight reflected from Earth's day side and onto the moon's night side. — Jamie Carter Look north, preferably about four hours after sunset, and you'll see one constellation that will be unmistakable. Cassiopeia is typically described as a W-shaped constellation, but tonight, it will look more like an M. A circumpolar constellation that revolves around the north star, Polaris, it's almost always in the northern hemisphere's night sky. In fall, it rides high and takes over from another famous shape of stars, the Big Dipper of Plough. That particular asterism (not an official constellation) is currently low on the horizon, as in the memory aid \"spring up, fall down.\" — Jamie Carter From about two hours before sunset, the beautiful sight of a 13%-illuminated waning crescent moon will be visible in the east just half a degree above Spica, the brightest star in the constellation Spica and one of the 20 brightest stars in the night sky. However, if you're in the eastern half of the U.S., eastern Canada or the north-western Bahamas, and you're in position looking to the southeast at around 5:35 a.m. EST, you'll see Spica disappear behind the moon's crescent. It will reappear about 75 minutes later, though the sky will be bright by then. Binoculars will help, as will this detailed map from In-The-Sky.org, which will also give you the specific timings for your exact location. — Jamie Carter If you have a clear sky, watch a sunset in the west. However, what happens after that is interesting. Swivel 180 degrees to face east, and you'll see a dark blue band appear on the horizon with a deep pink color above. The blue band will rise as you watch it, and the pink will dissipate. Astronomers call it the Belt of Venus, but what is it? It's Earth's shadow being projected onto its atmosphere. It will soon combine with night and disappear. — Jamie Carter Look to the east shortly before midnight tonight, and you'll see Mars — now shining unmistakably red as it gets closer to Earth — forming a loose triangle with bright star Procyon to its right and the \"twins\" of Gemini, Castor and Pollux, just above it. If you have keen eyes, dark skies, or a pair of binoculars, look for the Beehive Cluster (M44) just below the red planet. This star cluster is 610 light-years away in the constellation Cancer. Wait an hour, and the half-illuminated last quarter moon will appear below, with Regulus, the brightest star in the constellation Leo, just above it. — Jamie Carter Look to the south after sunset tonight for one of the night sky's most beautiful sights, an open cluster of sparkling young blue stars in the constellation Taurus called the Pleiades. Also known as M45 and the \"seven sisters,\" these stars, just 445 light-years away from the solar system, light up the clouds of gas and dust between them, giving the cluster an innate brightness that is hard to miss. Look to the left, and you'll see the bright planet Jupiter. Trace out the stars of the constellation Taurus, the bull — most noticeable for its V-shape of stars entered on reddish star Aldebaran — and you'll see that the giant planet is between the celestial animal's horns. — Jamie Carter Dozens of significant constellations of bright stars in the sky are very famous to stargazers, but few people know. One is the constellation of Auriga (the \"charioteer\"), a near-rectangle of five stars that will be visible in the southeast after dark tonight. Its brightest star is Capella, which means goat in Latin. It's the sixth-brightest star in the night sky. The lower-right star in the constellation is Elnath, which presently has Jupiter for company. — Jamie Carter Look east at moonrise where you are (about 11:00 p.m. local time) to see the 21-day-old waning gibbous moon rise. Few people watch the moon in this phase, but it's a beautiful late-night sight. With 58% of its Earth-facing side illuminated tonight, it's the perfect time of the month to see features like Mare Imbrium and Mare Nubium (vast lava plains) and the famous Kepler and Copernicus craters (lunar craters in the Oceanus Procellarum). Above the moon will be bright Mars, with shining stars Procyon and Sirius level with the planet, farther to the right. — Jamie Carter Editor's note: Fancy taking a more in-depth tour of our rocky companion? Check out our moon observation guide to learn more about what you can see on the lunar surface. Start your sky-watching tonight 30 minutes after sunset in the southwest, when you may be able to spot Mercury, which tonight will be at its highest point in the sky during its current evening apparition. At magnitude -0.3, it may be possible to see it with the naked eye as a reddish dot. If you have binoculars, use them only after the sun has entirely set. Mercury will be below and to the right of Venus. — Jamie Carter Check out the time of moonrise where you are (about five hours after sunset) tonight in the east to see Mars and the 70%-illuminated waning gibbous moon separated by about two degrees, the width of the two of your fingers held at arm's length against the sky. Mars is shining at a magnitude of 0.3 and rapidly brightening as its distance to Earth shortens. It's currently 81 million miles (131 million kilometers) distant. Mars will get closest to Earth on Jan. 12, 2025, at 59 million miles (96 million kilometers). That happens once every 26 months, as does its opposition four days later when it will be fully lit by the sun from our point of view, so it will shine at its brightest and best. — Jamie Carter Look to the eastern night sky at the precise time of moonrise where you are tonight (about four hours after sunset), and you'll see our satellite, now looking slightly oblong, with a bright star above it. That's Pollux, a star 34 light-years distant and nine times larger than our sun. It's one of the \"twins\" of Gemini. The other, Castor, will be slightly farther above the moon. Castor isn't just one star, but six. It's 51 light-years away. — Jamie Carter Some constellations are tiny. Others are vast. Draco, the dragon, belongs to the latter camp, a vast, loose, faint shape of stars that make a vague serpent's tail between the constellations of Hercules, Cepheus, Ursa Minor and Ursa Major. Look north tonight and see if you can find the head of the dragon, four stars of equal brightness to the lower-right of bright star Vega. Its tail then zigzags its way up and then down to the Big Dipper via 11 stars, finishing due north just above Dubhe. Draco is home to the Cat's Eye Nebula (NGC 6543), the Tadpole Galaxy (UGC 10214) and the Spindle Galaxy (M102). — Jamie Carter Today, we see the rise of the full moon and its occultation of the Pleiades. For the best view of the November full moon (2024's final supermoon), be somewhere at sunset to watch the fully-lit orangey orb rise in the east into the dusk sky (check the exact time of moonrise where you are). Just after midnight, the moon will move through and cover up the \"Seven Sister\" stars, the Pleiades. However, the moon will be so bright that it will be difficult to see the Pleiades. Since the Pleiades is close to the ecliptic — the sun's path through the sky, which the moon's orbital path intersects — the moon occasionally appears to travel through this naked-eye open star cluster of stars. — Jamie Carter The almost full moon will rise a little later tonight but should have more impact than yesterday because it will appear in the east in a darker sky. Check the time of moonrise where you are and be in place to see a more profoundly orangey full moon than last night. Look above the moon, and you'll see the Pleiades open star cluster of stars, which the moon occulted last night. Look again an hour after the moonrise, and you'll see the bright planet Jupiter rise beneath the moon. — Jamie Carter Some of the fastest shooting stars of the year come from the Leonid meteor shower, which peaks close to midnight tonight. Watch from late at night tonight through dawn tomorrow, and you can typically expect fast meteors with long, bright tails and perhaps even an unexpected outburst of activity during the peak. However, even the average 15 shooting stars per hour during the peak will be tricky to see this year thanks to the presence of a bright, waning gibbous moon, which will bleach the sky and make Leonaids hard to spot. — Jamie Carter Contrary to popular belief, the North Star is not the brightest in the night sky. It's the 48th brightest and is a triple-star system, with a yellow supergiant and two smaller stars. It's simple to find and will be a valuable navigational tool for the rest of your life. First, identify the stars' W (or M) shape in the northeastern night sky after sunset tonight. That's Cassiopeia. You'll find Polaris halfway between Cassiopeia and the easily recognizable stars of the Big Dipper, which tonight will be low on the northwest horizon. Earth's northern axis points at Polaris, so it remains perfectly still as all other stars travel across the sky (because Earth rotates). Those close to Polaris appear to move in circles around it in a time-lapse. — Jamie Carter Here's a great way of getting to know the fall night sky, even from a light-polluted city. Go outside about an hour after sunset and look to the northeast. Find two bright objects — the bright Pleiades open cluster of stars in the constellation Taurus, above east-northeast and the bright, white star Capella in the constellation Auriga, above northeast. Draw an imaginary line between them. Now, look for a third star above to complete an equilateral triangle. You'll come to Mirfak, the brightest star in the constellation Perseus. It's a supergiant double star about 510 light-years distant and intrinsically 5,000 times brighter than the sun. — Jamie Carter The peak of the Southern Taurids a week ago wasn't a major event, nor is the meteor shower it spills into tonight's Northern Taurids. Peaking Monday through tonight, it will bring up to about five shooting stars per hour. Like its sister shower, it tends to produce bright fireballs, but tonight, they'll be fighting against the bright light of the waxing gibbous moon. — Jamie Carter The solar system's largest planet, Jupiter, is now approaching its best of the year. Come Dec. 7, it will reach its annual opposition when it will be relatively close to Earth at 380 million miles (612 million kilometers) and shine at a magnitude of -2.8. By then, it will rise in the east at sunset and set in the west at sunrise. With a month to go before its opposition, Jupiter is already rising in the east two hours after sunset, and now, just 388 million miles (625 million kilometers), it's already shining at a magnitude of -2.75. In short, it's beginning to dominate the night sky, which means it's time to find a pair of binoculars (to see its four giant moons) and a telescope (to see its pink cloud bands). — Jamie Carter Tonight, the waxing crescent moon becomes a waxing gibbous moon — gibbous meaning rounded — as our natural satellite becomes half-lit by the sun, as seen from Earth. For stargazers, it's a critical moment because the moon has brightened enough to begin to bleach the night sky and make faint stars more challenging to see, a situation that will get more profound during the next week as the moon waxes towards becoming a full \"Beaver Moon.\" A waxing gibbous moon is illuminated from the right, whereas a waning gibbous moon (the week after the full moon) is illuminated from the left. — Jamie Carter You probably know the prominent, iconic asterism called the Summer Triangle. It's home to the Milky Way and dominates the northern hemisphere's summer night sky. It's now long past its best, but it can still be easily seen as it sinks into the western horizon immediately after sunset tonight. It comprises three bright stars — Deneb (in the constellation Cygnus), highest in the western sky tonight; Vega (in Lyra), below right; and Altair (in Aquila), below left. The latter gets little attention. Shining above Venus, if you come outside immediately after sunset, it's a mere 17 light-years away, one of the closest stars to our solar system. In Arabic, Altair is called Al Nasr Al-Tair, which translates as the Flying Eagle (Aquila is Latin for eagle). It spins on its axis once every 10 hours. — Jamie Carter Look southwest after dark; you'll see a bright 37%-illuminated waxing crescent moon approaching two shining points of light due south. The upper point will be the ringed planet Saturn, and below it will be Fomalhaut, the brightest star in the constellation Piscis Austrinus, the Southern Fish, and just 25 light-years distant. At magnitude +1, it's one of the brightest stars in the night sky. It's also one of the four Royal Stars of the Persian culture, and called the Watcher of the South. The other stars are Aldebaran (Watcher of the East), Regulus (Watcher of the North) and Antares (Watcher of the West). All are regarded as guardians of the sky. — Jamie Carter Look west again after sunset today to have an easier, albeit slightly wider, view of the now 18%-illuminated crescent moon and Earth's closest planetary neighbor, Venus. Tonight, we also see the peak of the Southern Taurid meteor shower. Though its five shooting stars per hour may seem like nothing to get excited about, Taurids tend to be bright fireballs, so it's a great night to go stargazing. — Jamie Carter Venus is well into its apparition as the 'Evening Star' in 2024, but if you want the best view of the brightest planet, catch it when a crescent moon slides past it. That happens tonight, with the sight of an 11%-illuminated crescent moon and the second planet above the western horizon. The two will be about three degrees apart, less than the width of your three middle fingers held at arm's length against the night sky. Venus will be above the moon. — Jamie Carter Here's another small constellation taking shelter within the Summer Triangle. After finding Altair at the bottom of that vast asterism of stars, travel to its top right to find a small shape of four stars in the shape of an arrow. It's best seen by identifying its two close stars and then taking a 90-degree turn to see its other two stars. Together, they slice off a corner of the Summer Triangle. — Jamie Carter You'll need a very dark sky for this, but with a new moon yesterday, it's the perfect opportunity to see one of the farthest objects possible to see with the naked eye. A whopping 2.5 million light-years distant, the Andromeda Galaxy — also known as M31 — is visible to keen eyes in the northeastern evening night sky in the northern hemisphere. It's between Cassiopeia and the Great Square of Pegasus, with the right-hand \"V\" in Cassiopeia's \"W\" shape acting as an arrowhead straight to it. M31 is the most remarkable galaxy for those stargazing from the northern hemisphere and can be easily found as a fuzzy patch in binoculars, even under urban skies. At about half a trillion stars, it's larger than the Milky Way and will collide with it in a few billion years. — Jamie Carter Early today sees the end of Daylight Savings Time in North America, where clocks will \"fall back\" this fall (as opposed to \"springing forward\" in spring) at 02:00 a.m. local time across the continent. However, you won't need to know the time for today's main sky sight, which will see a 6%-lit crescent moon tangle with Antares and Mercury in the western sky after sunset. The action will happen immediately after sunset and sink soon after, so grab a glimpse. Venus will be shining brightly above the melee to act as your guide. — Jamie Carter With many outside trick-or-treating, Halloween is the perfect time for stargazing and sharing the night sky. Venus will shine in the southwest at dusk, while dimmer Saturn rides high in the southeast. The Summer Triangle will be visible high above the southwest, while the stars of the Big Dipper will shine low above the northern horizon. About two hours after sunset, Jupiter will rise in the east. — Jamie Carter The night before Halloween, Devil's Night, provides an excellent excuse to look for a star known as the \"Demon Star.\" Algol in the constellation Perseus is the ultimate example of what astronomers call a variable star, dipping from +2.1 to +3.4 magnitude for about 10 hours every 69 hours. That happens because it's three stars that regularly eclipse each other. Its name comes from the Arabic \"Al Ra's al Ghul,\" which translates to \"the head of the demon,\" according to Britannica. Algol is easily visible to the naked eye as soon as it darkens. You'll find it halfway between Cassiopeia and the Pleiades star open cluster in the northeast night sky. Tonight, it's also above Jupiter. — Jamie Carter If you're an avid stargazer then you'll be excited to see the return to the early evening night sky this month of the closest and most spectacular open cluster of stars. The Pleiades, also called the \"Seven Sisters,\" are six or seven bright stars (depending on how good your eyesight is) arranged in a mini-Big Dipper shape. It's in the constellation of Taurus — above the \"V\" of Taurus — and heralds the rise of some of the brightest stars in the night sky, such as Orion's Belt, Betelgeuse and Sirius. The Pleiades will rise tonight in the east as the sun sets. Becoming visible just above east-southeast as it gets dark. Look straight at the Pleiades and see its six or seven stars. However, looking slightly to its side is a better way to appreciate the Pleiades. Try it! Instead of points of light, you'll see what seems like a very bright patch. This technique, called averted vision, is also handy for looking at galaxies through a telescope. It works because while direct vision is necessary for detail, peripheral vision is sensitive to brightness. — Jamie Carter You'll probably know how to find the famous Summer Triangle in the sky. Just look high above the southwest to see its three bright stars — Deneb (top), Vega (middle) and Altair (bottom). However, close to Altair is a small constellation worth searching out. Just above Altair and to the left, you'll find Delphinus, the dolphin (or is it a tadpole?) that's most easily found by locating its four brightest stars in a diamond shape, which is known to stargazers as \"Job's Coffin.\" — Jamie Carter It's been a few weeks since the crescent moon tangled first with Venus, then Antares. Since then, the planet has inched closer toward the massive star, and tonight, they'll be in conjunction — very close to each other. Look to the southwest after dark to see Venus positioned slightly higher than Antares, separated by about three degrees. — Jamie Carter Now waning towards the new moon — and an inevitable eclipse of the sun — our natural satellite will tonight be 30%-lit as it sails through the constellation Leo. Look to the southeast before dawn; you'll see it just three above Regulus, Leo's brightest star and one of the brightest in the night sky. It's about 78 light-years from the solar system. — Jamie Carter Look to the northeast after dark, and you'll quickly see the constellation Cassiopeia high in the sky. What's that bright yellow-orange star below it? The brightest star of the constellation Auriga, the charioteer, and the sixth brightest in the night sky, Capella, will be with us for many months. Just 43 light-years from the solar system, it's two giant binary stars — each about 10 times larger than the sun — and two fainter, distant, red dwarf stars. Capella is the \"Goat Star\" because it was once used as a guiding light for shepherds. Look just above-right of Capella and, in a dark sky, you'll see an elongated triangle of stars, with one close to Capella and two tighter stars more distant. They're called \"The Kids,\" meant to be Capella's offspring. — Jamie Carter Today's last or third quarter moon sees our satellite half-lit as seen from Earth as it transitions from being a waning gibbous moon to a waning crescent moon. Rising around midnight and setting around noon tomorrow, it's an important waymarker for sky-watchers because it signals the opening of a window of dark, moonless evenings that will last for the next ten nights or so. — Jamie Carter Though mostly the same sight as last night, tonight — again, just before midnight — you'll be able to watch a now 51%-lit waning gibbous moon rising in the east-northeast alongside Mars and below the stars of the constellation Gemini. Once again, Capella, Jupiter and the stars of Orion will shine brightly above. — Jamie Carter Be outside looking to the east-northeast just before midnight local time, and you'll see a gaggle of bright celestial objects appear individually. Bright Jupiter will be an easy spot, with Capella to its upper left. Rising below will be a very bright, 70%-lit waning gibbous moon, which will appear to the right of the two bright stars in Gemini, Castor and Pollux and farther to the left of the unmistakable stars of Orion's Belt. Either side of its three belt stars — Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka — will be ruddy Betelgeuse and blue Rigel. Wait for the moon to rise a few degrees above the horizon, and Mars will appear below it. — Jamie Carter Is comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) still visible to the naked eye? By now, it may not be, but it's still worth looking for the icy visitor from the solar system's edge. As it creeps higher into the night sky, tonight it enters the constellation Ophiuchus, the thirteenth yet roundly ignored zodiacal constellation (zodiacal meaning the sun passes through it). It will now be visible above the southwest horizon as soon as it darkens. It's a long shot, but if you're in a dark sky destination away from light pollution, the Milky Way may be visible in the southwest, providing a backdrop to the comet. — Jamie Carter If you're a novice stargazer, locating Cassiopeia will give you a greater understanding of navigating the night sky. As a bonus, it's easy to find this time of year. Look to the northeast for a slightly misshapen W-shape of five bright stars. If you can't find it, look to the northeast for the Big Dipper, which is always roughly opposite. That's because the stars in the north appear to rotate around Polaris, the North Star, which you'll find between them in a dark patch of sky. While the Big Dipper is easily found all spring and summer (\"spring up, fall down\"), the opposite is the case for Cassiopeia, which will be easy to see all fall and winter, albeit mainly as an inverted W. — Jamie Carter Another \"supermoon\"?! Yes — and not only that but the biggest and brightest of the year. Why? October's full moon will be the closest to Earth, that's all. With the moon taking a slightly elliptical journey around Earth each month, it's sure to happen every year. Be outside looking east at moonrise where you are — during dusk — to see it appear on the horizon draped in orange hues. October's full moon is considered the \"Hunter's Moon\" by early Native American tribes who used its all-night light to hunt for game. — Jamie Carter Despite the moon shining brightly tonight, it's a good time to look east from about two hours before midnight dark for the stars of the constellation Taurus, \"the bull,\" not least because there's currently an extra \"star.\" First, look for Aldebaran, the \"eye of the bull,\" and the brightest star in Taurus. Now, find the faint \"V\" of Taurus. That's the Hyades star clusters, one of the closest to the solar system. Above will be the fuzzy Pleiades, and to the lower left will be bright Jupiter. — Jamie Carter Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) is climbing higher into the night sky, though likely getting dimmer as it does. It's now between Venus and Arcturus but still relatively close to the sun, so be looking west as soon as the sun sets. A pair of binoculars or a telescope may be decisive. — Jamie Carter Fresh from its bright opposition in September, Saturn remains an excellent target for naked eye stargazers. As luck would have it, tonight it will rise with the almost full moon, appearing just after sunset in North America. Once the moon has risen into a darker sky and lost its golden yellow look, you'll see Saturn trailing behind it by just the width of your pinky finger at arm's length. From parts of South and East Africa, India, China and Southeast Asia, the moon will appear to occult Saturn, according to In-The-Sky.org. — Jamie Carter Look again to the western sky after dark to have another slight chance of seeing Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) and its tail, either with your naked eyes or using a pair of binoculars or a telescope to give you a better chance. Today, we also see the opening of the launch window for NASA's EscaPADE mission to Mars, which will launch on the debut flight of Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket. — Jamie Carter After dark on Oct. 11, look for the Summer Triangle high in the sky above the moon. (Image credit: Starry Night/Jamie Carter) The most famous shape from July through fall is the Summer Triangle, a vast asterism with three bright stars — Vega, Deneb and Altair — making its corners. It's on the wane by now, but it's still prominent. After dark tonight, it will be visible high above the southwest, appearing to point like an arrowhead at the now 63%-lit waxing gibbous moon in the south. — Jamie Carter The name of today's phase of the moon is rather misleading. At first quarter, the moon appears half-lit — as it always is — with only one side illuminated as seen from Earth. Earth's perspective is everything when it comes to the moon. It's tidally locked to Earth, so it always shows the same face and rotates only once with respect to the sun in each orbit. Where you are on Earth with respect to the equator affects what a first-quarter moon looks like; from the northern hemisphere, the moon's right-hand side is lit, while from the southern hemisphere, it's the left-hand side. Either way, the first quarter moon is when the night skies begin to get brightly lit by moonlight in the early evenings, making stargazing trickier. — Jamie Carter Oct. 7's Draconid meteor shower will appear to travel from the northern sky, close to the Big Dipper. (Image credit: Haitong Yu via Getty Images) Hope for clear skies to the north today. If you're in the northern hemisphere, arguably the year's most convenient meteor shower, the Draconids, will peak. Rates of \"shooting stars\" tend to peak when the course constellation is highest in the sky, typically after midnight. However, since Draco is circumpolar (appearing to rotate around Polaris, the North Star), it's always visible, so you may see some as soon as it gets dark. As twilight fades, don't forget to look to the southwest, where a now 23%-lit waxing crescent moon will shine just a couple of degrees from Antares in Scorpius. — Jamie Carter Here's a famous star-hop that will work well this month but be nearly impossible by November. Face north-northwest when it gets completely dark, and you'll see the familiar shape of the Big Dipper, its seven stars shaped like a bowl (on the right) and a handle(on the left). Follow the curve of its handle and keep going, and you'll reach Arcturus, which is low above the western horizon. About two hours after sunset, Arcturus will set, and the Big Dipper will be dead on the northern horizon. — Jamie Carter A delicate crescent moon beside Venus is one of the sky's most beautiful sights and one of October's sky-watching highlights. It's on offer to anyone who looks southwest in a clear sky immediately after sunset tonight, where a delicate 9%-lit waxing crescent moon will shine very low on the horizon just below and left of the planet. They'll be about four degrees apart, the span of your three middle fingers at arm's length. Venus will likely be easier to see. — Jamie Carter Although the moon has moved another 27th of its journey around Earth, it's still a slim crescent and remains very close to Venus. Tonight, the 15%-lit waxing crescent will shine to the left of Venus and will likely be easier to see than last night. You'll also see \"Earthshine\" on the moon's dark limb — sunlight reflected from Earth's oceans and ice caps. — Jamie Carter The Milky Way is always visible in the night sky, but it's only prominent between April and October in the Northern Hemisphere. This week is a good time to get a last look at the bright star fields of Sagittarius and Scorpius. You must be in a dark sky destination, such as a Dark Sky Place or anywhere that looks dark on a light pollution map. Look south as soon as it gets completely dark. You'll see the Milky Way's center, its brightest section, close to the horizon, with a stream of stars thinning out as it arcs high above your head through Cassiopeia, a constellation of five stars shaped like the letter W. You just saw the Perseus Arm of the Milky Way. — Jamie Carter Did you see the total solar eclipse on April 8? Here's the follow-up. There are at least two solar eclipses yearly, but not all are total. What happens today is an annular solar eclipse, where the new moon passes directly in front of the sun but doesn't cover it completely. Since the moon will be farther from Earth than on April 8, its disk will be too small to completely cover the sun, creating instead a \"ring of fire.\" To see the ring today, you'll need to be within a narrow 165 miles (267 kilometers) wide path stretching 8,800 miles (14,163 kilometers) across the Pacific Ocean, South America (the Patagonia region of southern Chile and Argentina) and the South Atlantic Ocean. It's a sparsely populated area, home to just 175,000 people. Most eclipse chasers are headed to Easter Island (Rapa Nui, a remote island 2,200 miles (3,540 km) west of Chile. Much of South America will see a partial solar eclipse. Everyone, whether in the path or not, will need to wear solar eclipse glasses or use solar filters on telescopes and binoculars to observe the event safely. — Jamie Carter Editor's note: You can keep up with all the solar eclipse action with our solar eclipse live blog. We will also be streaming the eclipse live on Space.com. Here's one last chance for those in the northern hemisphere to try for a naked-eye view of Comet C/2023 A3 Tsuchinshan Atlas before it's only visible to those in equatorial regions for a few mornings. If you're having trouble finding it in the horizon haze, consider using a pair of binoculars or a telescope to give you a better chance. If you want a souvenir shot, see how to photograph comets, the best cameras for astrophotography and the best lenses for astrophotography. — Jamie Carter If you're up for an early start to the weekend, this morning presents another great chance to try for a naked-eye view of Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS). That said, given the fickle of comets, it may be wise to have a pair of the best binoculars or one of the best telescopes to give yourself the best chance. Also, check out how to photograph comets, our best cameras for astrophotography and the best lenses for astrophotography. — Jamie Carter Here's a chance for sky-watchers in the northern hemisphere to glimpse Comet C/2023 A3 Tsuchinshan-ATLAS before it disappears for a few weeks. Now, three days after its perihelion — its closest point to the sun — it may be getting less bright and tougher to see before sunrise as it retreats into the sun's glare. Look east-southeast an hour before sunrise. — Jamie Carter Early Friday morning, we could see the first opportunity for sky-watchers in the northern hemisphere to glimpse Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS). It arrives today at perihelion — its closest point to the sun — as it gets to within 36 million miles (58 million km) of our star. That means it should reach peak brightness. Comets are fickle and hard to predict, but it's possible it could be visible to the naked eye. To see if that prediction comes true, be outside looking east-southeast an hour before sunrise. — Jamie Carter Few people realize that the stars rise four minutes earlier each night, returning to where they are precisely 23 hours and 56 minutes later. This is what astronomers call a sidereal day, and over a month, it means stars rise two hours earlier. Today that means you can effectively go stargazing at 4:00 a.m. on Sept. 25, look east, and see the same sky as you would see at 10:00 p.m. in December. You'll see some of the brightest stars in the night sky in the famous winter constellations: Rigel and Betelgeuse in Orion (as well as Orion's belt rising on its side), Aldebaran in Taurus, Capella in Auriga, Pollux and Castor in Gemini, Procyon in Canis Minor and Sirius in Canis Major. With Betelgeuse at the center, you can trace-put the stars to make a vast shape known variously as the Great Hexagon, also known as the Winter Hexagon and Winter Circle. As a bonus, you'll find Jupiter above Betelgeuse and Mars to its left, about four degrees (the span of your three middle fingers at arm's length) from a waning crescent moon.— Jamie Carter Related: How to see the 'Great Hexagon' of bright winter stars Pollux is the brightest star in the constellation Gemini and one of the most colorful in Earth's sky. It's also one of the closest bright stars at just 34 light years. This morning it will shine just 1.6 degrees from the waning gibbous moon (about the width of your pinky finger at arm's length), about a third of which will be illuminated tonight. — Jamie Carter The moon will rise half-lit in the east at midnight tonight, as seen from Earth. That's because it reaches the Last Quarter (also called the Third Quarter), which marks the completion of three-quarters of its monthly journey around the sun. That moment officially comes at 2:50 p.m. EDT when the moon is below the horizon for those in North America. Its left-hand half will be illuminated, as observed from the northern hemisphere. It will set in the west around midday on Wednesday, Sept. 25. — Jamie Carter With the moon rising late at night, there's one last window of moonless dark skies to see the Milky Way while it's still prominent. Now sinking into the southwestern horizon, it's still an incredible sight if you can escape light pollution. You should get a fantastic view any night for the rest of this month. Come October, however, it will be lost in the horizon haze, not returning to view until April. — Jamie Carter September is the perfect month to look for Fomalhaut, the \"autumn star,\" from mid-northern latitudes. It's the 18th brightest star in the night sky, but one generally associated with the southern hemisphere. Those observing from about 40 degrees north and below can see it this month just above due south, below Saturn. It's in the constellation Piscis Austrinus, the southern fish, just 25 light-years away from the solar system. — Jamie Carter Related: Fomalhaut: 'Eye of Sauron' With A 'Zombie Planet' After it gets dark tonight — and any night this month — look to the east, and you'll quickly find four stars that appear to make a square (albeit on its side, so looking more like a diamond). It will be just to the right of the W-shaped constellation Cassiopeia. The corner four stars — Scheat, Alpheratz, Markab and Algenib — make up the Great Square in the constellation of Pegasus. It's likely more prominent than you might expect, and it's hard to ignore after you've found it. Its rise in the east signals the coming of autumn, which begins tomorrow. — Jamie Carter It's not something you can see, but today at 7:44 a.m. EDT is equinox, meaning equal night in Latin. It means roughly 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night worldwide (although that technically occurs on Sept. 26 for 40 degrees latitude). It's a landmark moment of the year for stargazers and amateur astronomers in the northern hemisphere because there will finally be more darkness than daylight. However, today's real attraction is the close pass of the 75%-illuminated waning gibbous moon and the Pleiades. There will be just 0.2 degrees between the two at 5:17 a.m. EDT. Uranus will be just below but too dim to see with the naked eye. — Jamie Carter Read more: See the moon meet up with the Seven Sisters of the Pleiades this weekend The Southern Cross is a fabulous sight for those in the Southern Hemisphere, but did you know there's also a Northern Cross? It's more commonly known as the constellation Cygnus, the swan, though it looks much more like a cross than a bird to most eyes. Face southeast tonight anytime after dark, and you should be able to pick out Deneb, a bright star and one of the corners of the famous Summer Triangle asterism. Return to Debeb, and you'll see three stars close to it within the Summer Triangle and another single star in the middle of the Summer Triangle, called Albireo. Put them together, and you have the head of a swan (Albireo) with the wings behind or, more obviously, a simple cross. — Jamie Carter The Earth partially eclipsing the second-largest supermoon of the year may seem like a terrific double-header not to miss, but it's set to be a slightly underwhelming event. Although the moon turns full at 10:34 p.m. EDT, that's not when to look. Instead, look east at moonrise to make the best of the moon illusion, the human brain's strong tendency for the moon to appear larger than it is when it's just coming over the horizon. This phenomenon will explain why the rising \"Harvest Moon\" will look full rather than because it's a supermoon, which, although it places it closer to Earth than on average, will make no discernable difference to its visible size. For the proof, go look at the full moon once it's risen higher —it won't look any different from any other. As a bonus, on the other side of the sky at moonrise, bright Venus will shine close to Spica. Later in the evening, a partial lunar eclipse will occur. It will see only a small slither of the moon's edge (just 8.4%) recede into Earth's central shadow, with the best time to view it 10:12-11:15 p.m. EDT (3:12-4:15 a.m. GMT on Wednesday, Sept. 18). However, it's also fun to watch the Earth's fuzzier penumbral shadow travel across the moon. You can get a full schedule for your location on Timeanddate. Wherever you watch the full \"supermoon\" rise from today, watch for Saturn to its upper-right. — Jamie Carter Read more: Don't miss the Harvest Moon Supermoon lunar eclipse tonight! Here's what to expect Editor's note: If you are unable to watch the lunar eclipse in person you can watch all the action unfold online here on Space.com. We have rounded up several lunar eclipse livestreams that are showing the Super Harvest Moon on Sept. 17. Although it was yesterday that the \"supermoon\" was celebrated, it's early this morning that the moon reaches perigee — its closest point to Earth on its slightly elliptical monthly orbital path. It reached that point at 8:26 a.m. EDT today. So, if you catch it close to moonset where you are, you'll see the true \"supermoon.\" However, it won't be quite full — see its slightly ragged lower-right edge (as seen from the northern hemisphere). Come back at moonrise later today and you'll see an almost full moon with a slightly more ragged top-right edge. — Jamie Carter Summer is almost over. How do we know? The Summer Triangle of stars — Deneb, Vega and Altair — and beginning to sink in the west as it gets dark. After riding high all summer, the famous asterism is now looking lop-sided as the night wears on. However, it's got some staying power yet, with tonight offering the chance to make the triangle into a diamond. Face south, and you'll see Altair at the bottom of the triangle, at its tip, with Deneb high up above the east and Vega towards the west. Now make a triangle on the other side of Altair and Vega, with a reasonably bright star called Rasalhague. It's the brightest star in Ophiuchus, a large yet little-known constellation, one of the 13th zodiacal constellations. With Deneb opposite, Rasalhague makes a Summer Diamond shape. — Jamie Carter Last month, sky-watchers in Europe saw Saturn occulted — covered up or eclipsed — by the moon. This month, it's the turn of those in North America to watch the ringed planet dramatically disappear for about 45 minutes behind an almost full moon. This lunar occultation of Saturn will take place between 4:08 a.m. and 8:07 a.m. EDT and will be visible along the western United States, Australia, western Canada and north-western Mexico, to name but a few. To see if the occultation is visible from your location, check out IntheSky.org.— Jamie Carter Related: Astrophotographer captures Saturn vanishing behind the moon in mesmerizing photo. If you've yet to see Venus this year, tonight is an excellent opportunity. The second planet from the sun has been conspicuous by its absence from the evening night sky since 2023 but is now beginning to shine more brightly after sunset just above the west-southwest horizon. After the sun and moon, it's the brightest object in the night sky, shining at magnitude -3.9 tonight. As a bonus, you'll find another bright object nearby, just a couple of degrees (the span of your two smallest fingers at arm's length) to the left. That's Spica, the brightest star in the constellation of Virgo and the 16th brightest star in the night sky. This bluish-white helium star is about 262 light-years distant and hugely luminous (it's about 2,300 times more luminous than the sun). Try to catch Venus as the \"Evening Star\" and Virgo's brightest star quickly after sunset because they will sink soon after. The sight of Spica is associated with summer in the northern hemisphere, so its disappearance soon after sunset signals that the summer season is about to end, with autumn officially arriving in the northern hemisphere on Sept. 22. — Jamie Carter The week before the full moon is perfect for seeing the moon in the afternoon. It rises in the southeast (as seen from the northern hemisphere) in mid-afternoon. Since it's already reached its first quarter phase, it's now a waxing gibbous moon, which means over half of its visible face is illuminated, and it's waxing towards full. Since the moon is 400,000 times less bright than the sun, it won't be immediately apparent in a blue sky, but keep looking, and you'll quickly see it with your naked eyes. As the day progresses into the evening, it will rise higher and become more prominent and then dominate the southern sky as twilight takes hold. The moon takes 29.5 days to orbit Earth, roughly dividing its journey into four phases. Tonight sees it reach first quarter, which marks the halfway point between a new and full moon. Rising around midday and setting around midnight, the moon will be precisely 50% illuminated — as seen from Earth — at 2:06 a.m. EDT (0606 GMT). That's because it's at a 90-degree angle from the sun, so only its eastern side will receive sunlight. It's an excellent naked-eye target for twilight that puts the eastern side of the moon on display.— Jamie Carter Related: What is the moon phase today? Lunar phases 2024 During evening twilight, a half-moon will shine brightly in the south. Look to its right, and you'll see the red supergiant star Antares, the brightest in the constellation Scorpius, one of the 13 zodiac constellations. It's prominent at this time of year from both hemispheres. Look carefully, and you'll notice the reddish-orange color of Antares, a symptom of its relatively low temperature. Around 604 light-years from Earth, Antares is 700 times the sun's diameter. If it were in the solar system, it would engulf Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Its name means \"anti-Ares\" or \"rival of Mars\" because the red planet passes close to it every 26 months. Scorpius is a region of the sky rich in star fields and deep sky objects (such as the Butterfly Cluster (NGC 6405 and Messier 6), Ptolemy's Cluster (NGC 6475 or M7) and M4) because it's near the center of the Milky Way. — Jamie Carter Read more: Night sky, September 2024: What you can see tonight [maps] Look due west again tonight just after sunset, and with a clear view low to the west-southwest horizon, you'll see a crescent moon a little higher in the sky. This time, Venus will be farther to the lower right of the crescent moon, close to the horizon. Now around 13% illuminated, it should be possible to see a trace of light on the moon's dark side, opposite the crescent. That's sunlight reflected from Earth onto the moon; it's called \"Da Vinci glow,\" \"planet-shine,\" or \"Earthshine.\" Look carefully, and you'll see a star to the moon's right. That's Spica in Virgo, one of the brightest stars that the moon appears to frequently pass on its monthly journey around Earth. — Jamie Carter Look west just after sunset for a remarkable sight denied to stargazers since last year. The two brightest objects in the sky aside from the sun — the moon and Venus — will tonight shine about six degrees (the span of your three middle fingers held at arm's length) from each other for a short time after sunset. You'll need a good view low to the western horizon (try a tall building or observe from a west-facing beach). The crescent moon will be very delicate and may require binoculars. Venus is known as the \"Evening Star\" in its current apparition because it's visible after sunset. — Jamie Carter Related: Night sky, September 2024: What you can see tonight [maps] As the sun sets on Wednesday, Sept. 4 the waxing crescent moon will be just above the western horizon near a bright Venus. A very thin crescent moon will be located just several finger-widths to Venus' lower right (to its celestial west) — close enough that both can be seen by binoculars (orange circle in the image above). Skywatchers viewing the pair from southerly latitudes will be able to see the moon more easily, as the pair will be close to the horizon at sunset for everyone else. Mercury, the closest planet to the sun, is rarely seen. Since it orbits so close to our star, it's typically lost in its glare and impossible to see. That changes occasionally when its position in the solar system relative to Earth puts it temporarily high above the horizon on a few successive days. It can only ever be visible from Earth just before sunrise or just after sunset. The former is the case tonight, with Mercury's so-called \"greatest western elongation\" from the sun (at 18 degrees) placing it just above the eastern horizon about half an hour before sunrise this morning. You'll need a good view low to the eastern horizon, but at magnitude +0.4 the tiny planet is relatively dim — don't expect much more than a red dot. It's worth returning at the same time on Saturday, Sept. 8, when Mercury appears a little higher in the sky. — Jamie Carter There is no guarantee of northern lights tonight, or any night this month, but something about September makes them more likely and, in theory, more intense. Given that the nights are drawing in in the northern hemisphere, and the moon sets early all this week, it may be a good week to see them at lower latitudes than is typical. The reason is what's known as the Russell-McPherron Effect. It's a hypothesis from a paper published in 1973 that the tilt of the Earth's axis at the time of equinox (which occurs on Sept. 22) puts it side-on to the sun, meaning Earth's magnetic field is aligned to the solar wind. This means a greater chance of more intense geomagnetic storms, which cause aurora displays. You'll need to consult the NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center to see if there's a favorable prediction tonight (a G4 or a G5 geomagnetic storm is what you want if you live in mid-northern latitudes), but aurora hunters often claim that the equinoxes are the best times for beautiful displays. Pay special attention to NOAA's 3-day Forecast and the prediction for the aurora view line for tonight and tomorrow. — Jamie Carter Related: Aurora season is here: What to expect from the northern lights in 2024/25 It won't be a spectacular display, but expect about six \"shooting stars\" per hour as the Aurigid meteor shower peaks tonight. It's named after the Auriga constellation, which will rise in the northeast around midnight and highest just before dawn breaks. It's not worth staying up for per se, but if you're out stargazing in the early hours today, keep an eye out for fast-moving meteors. The Aurigids are active each year from Aug. 28 through Sept. 4.— Jamie Carter Mercury orbits the sun every 88 days, closer to the sun than Earth, so we see it briefly emerge from the sun's glare only now and again. Today, it will be just below and right from a very slim crescent moon about an hour before sunrise in the pre-dawn sky. It won't be easy to see with the naked eye, but the moon will help you find it. Look out for mesmerizing Earthshine (sunlight is reflected off Earth) on the moon's dark side. — Jamie Carter On Monday, Sept. 2, at 9:55 p.m. EDT, the moon will officially reach its new moon phase. It’s impossible to see because it’s roughly between the Earth and the sun, so lost in the latter’s glare (unless there's a solar eclipse, which is precisely what will happen next month when an annular solar eclipse will be seen from the southern hemisphere). That makes it the perfect night to see faint objects in the night sky. If you can get far away from light pollution, September is a great time to see the “false dawn” or zodiacal light, which becomes visible about an hour before sunrise in the eastern sky. It is sunlight scattered off dust in the solar system and is brightest close to the autumnal equinox, which will occur later this month. — Jamie Carter Related: Wonder at the 'false dawn' of zodiacal light in early autumn Look to the east for a view on the morning of Aug. 30, of a slim, waning crescent moon in the subtle light of dawn. Just a tenth of its surface will be sun-lit as it glides below two stars, Castor and Pollux, in the constellation Gemini. The top star, Castor, is 51 light-years distant, while the yellowish Pollux, between it and the moon, is 34 light-years away. These \"twins\" of Gemini are best known as winter evening stars. Look to the right, and you'll see other winter stars, including the three famous stars of Orion's Belt — Mintaka, Alnilam and Alnitak — and ruddy Betelgeuse. This red supergiant will one day go supernova. — Jamie Carter From late August to early September mornings, six planets — Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune and Saturn — will be visible across the morning sky. Looking East. South and West, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn will be relatively easy to spot the other three will be a bit more of a challenge. You'll need a small telescope or binoculars to see the dimmer planets Uranus and Neptune and Mercury will only appear about 30 minutes or so before sunrise. You can use a program like Stellarium to discover what is visible in the night sky from your viewing location at a particular time. The summer nights are perfect for observing the strange star Algol (or Beta Persei) in the constellation Perseus. It is one of the most easy-to-monitor variable stars. During a ten-hour period that repeats every 2 days, 20 hours, and 49 minutes, Algol dims noticeably and then re-brightens when a companion star with an orbit nearly edge-on to Earth crosses behind the much brighter main star, reducing the total light output we perceive. Algol normally shines at magnitude 2.1, similar to the nearby star Almach in Andromeda. But while dimmed to minimum brightness, Algol's magnitude of 3.4 is almost the same as the star Rho Persei (ρ Per), which shines just two finger widths to Algol's lower right (or 2.25 degrees to the celestial south). — Chris Vaughan A third (or last) quarter moon looks half-lit and appears around midnight. The sight of it rising in the east late at night can be dramatic. This moon phase is much-loved by naked-eye stargazers precisely because it rises so late, leaving the early evening night sky dark enough to see faint constellations and deep sky targets. A third-quarter moon always sets in the western daytime sky in the early afternoon. Over the next week, it will shrink to a crescent moon, which will be best seen in the east in the pre-dawn hours towards the end of this week. — Jamie Carter From the wee hours until dawn on Tuesday morning, Aug. 27, the pretty, waning crescent moon will shine above the planets Jupiter and Mars in the eastern sky, setting up a nice widefield photo opportunity. (Image credit: Chris Vaughan/Starry Night) In the very early hours of this morning, a plump crescent moon will rise in the east above a couple of planets. Directly below will be Jupiter, shining at a magnitude -2.2, followed by Mars at +2. To the right of Jupiter will be Aldebaran, the brightest star in the Taurus constellation, while above all of that will be the sparkling Pleiades open cluster of stars. Look at the same time on Wednesday, Aug. 28, and you'll see a slimmer crescent moon alongside Mars. — Jamie Carter On late August evenings, four small constellations sit high in the southeastern sky below the very bright star Vega. The easiest one to see is Delphinus, the Dolphin, which is composed of four medium-bright stars forming a small elongated diamond connected to a star extending to the lower right (or celestial southwest). Equuleus, the Little Horse is positioned about a fist's diameter below Delphinus. Diminutive Equuleus is the second to last constellation by size, after Crux, the Southern Cross. Sitting a generous fist's width above Delphinus is the next smallest constellation by area, Sagitta, the Arrow. And sweeping a palm's width higher will bring you to the stars of Vulpecula, the Fox. Except for the slightly larger fox, each of these small constellations will fit within the field of view of binoculars. The Milky Way passes through Sagitta and Vulpecula, populating them with a variety of deep sky objects. The sky between those two constellations hosts a dark dust lane. -- Chris Vaughan It's not every day you can gaze at the moon and spot a landmark from one of the most iconic sci-fi films. The Harpalus crater served as the rocket landing site in the 1950s movie \"Destination Moon.\" Due to its close proximity to the lunar north pole, the Harpalus crater is significantly foreshortened when viewed from Earth, often appearing more oval than circular. But the moon's axial wobble, known as libration, occasionally but regularly tilts features close to the edge toward us and then away, letting us get a peek 'around the edge' of the moon. This month, Harpalus will be well placed for observation as the crater will be tipped slightly toward us. When viewed through a small telescope you'll be able to make out the details on the walls and floor of the 25-mile (40 kilometers) wide crater and even another small crater within it. The crater remains fully illuminated until Aug. 27, when the terminator (the division between the illuminated and dark hemispheres) will return and plunge the crater back into darkness, by Sept. 5 the crater will be out of view. -- Daisy Dobrijevic Saturn will reach its annual opposition in just a few weeks when it will be at its biggest and brightest in Earth's sky of the entire year. Tonight there's a preview, when it appears next to an almost full moon. Rising in the east after sunset at about 9:30 p.m. local time, the two will shine together all night. However, it's always impossible to glimpse Saturn's famous ring pattern with the naked eye. You'll need a small telescope for that. If you rise early in the morning on Aug. 21, wherever you are, you'll see the pretty sight of the moon and Saturn setting together in the southwestern sky before sunrise. However, if you're in parts of Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa and Europe, the moon will pass in front of Saturn, blocking it from view for a short period. Countries with a good view include Brazil, Portugal, Spain, France and the U.K., according to In-The-Sky.org. From the U.K., this lunar occultation will take place from 4:25 to 5:23 a.m. GMT on Aug. 21. — Jamie Carter The moon is the easiest target for the naked eye, but when you look at it does make a big difference. Although August's full moon will become officially 100%-lit at 2:26 p.m. EDT, 11:26 a.m. PDT and 18:26 GMT, the time to look at it will be moonrise. It's much easier to look at the moon as it appears on the eastern horizon, draped in subtle orangey light, compared to just 20 minutes later, when it will have risen higher into the sky and become a lot brighter and whiter. The full moon is always at its most impactful when viewed on the horizon, thanks to the moon illusion. Today's full moon will be slightly bigger than usual because it will be slightly closer to Earth on its elliptical orbital path — hence the name 'supermoon' — though that will be virtually impossible to detect. It will also be a 'Blue Moon' thanks to a calendar quirk; it will be the third of four full moons in the astronomical season of summer. However, at no point will the moon look blue. — Jamie Carter You can watch the Supermoon Blue Moon rise today in a free livestream starting at 3:30 p.m. EDT (1930 GMT), weather permitting. As the moon waxes towards being full next week, it rises earlier and will be easy to see shining brightly after dark, but it's visible many hours before sunset. Today, the moon will rise about 90% and be illuminated in the southeast at about 6:30 p.m. local time. The late-afternoon moon occurs because the moon is orbiting the Earth from west to east, traveling 13 degrees every 24 hours, thus rising around 50 minutes earlier each day. It will be a beautiful sight in a blue sky for a short time and dominate the post-sunset twilight sky. — Jamie Carter Just after midnight local time, Jupiter and Mars will come up over the east-northeast horizon and will be well-placed for viewing an hour or two later. Jupiter will shine at magnitude -2.2 and Mars +0.8, but despite their large difference in brightness, the pair will make for an interesting skywatching sight. The pair will appear very cozy in the night sky, appearing just 20 or so arc minutes apart, meaning you'll be able to fit both planets in the view of a telescope, with low-to-moderate magnification. Bright stars in the summer night sky are a great skywatching target for those in the Northern Hemisphere. If you look at them long enough you should notice that they shine different colors. The color of a star is controlled by the temperature of its photosphere — the outer 'shell' which radiates light. The colors change blue to white to yellow to orange, as temperature decreases, with the coolest stars appearing red. The three prominent stars of the Summer Triangle asterism in the eastern sky —Deneb, Vega, and Altair — are A-class stars that appear blue-white to the naked eye, with temperatures ranging from 7,500 to 10,000 Kelvin. In contrast, Arcturus, visible in the western evening sky, is an orange K-class giant star with a temperature of around 4,300 K. Meanwhile, the reddish Antares, the heart of the Scorpius constellation, is an older M-class star with a cooler surface temperature of 3,500 K. After midnight local time, look for the very bright, yellowish Capella rising in the northeast. You can estimate the temperatures of dimmer stars by comparing their color to these bright reference stars. Look to the south immediately after sunset, and you'll see a waxing gibbous moon, now more than half-lit, shining brightly. Look to its upper left, and you may spy Antares, a reddish star now at its best. It's the brightest star in the iconic constellation of Scorpius and about 555 light-years from the solar system. Squint at it, and you'll more easily notice its reddish hue. The later you look, the closer the moon and Antares will be. From the South Pacific, the moon will occult (block) Antares, according to In-The-Sky.org. — Jamie Carter It will be worth getting up early for this, one of the closest conjunctions between planets this year. Visible in the southeast from about 2 a.m. local time until sunrise, Mars and Jupiter will get to just a third of a degree apart (a third of the width of your little finger held at arm's length). However, Jupiter, at magnitude -2.2, will be about 15 times brighter than Mars at magnitude +0.8. Although the two planets will appear at their closest this morning, it will be worth looking at the pair during the mornings before and after for a similar view. — Jamie Carter Early this morning, the peak of the annual Perseid meteor shower took place, but don't despair if you missed it because of work or bad weather. Although you won't get another chance to see 50-75 \"shooting stars\" in an hour — as was possible last night — it will be wise to look skywards late tonight (preferably after midnight early on Tuesday, Aug.13) if skies are clear for the chance of a healthy number of bright meteors. If you can't escape to truly dark skies, keep any artificial lights away from your direct line of sight because there's always a chance of seeing one or two particularly bright \"fireballs.\" The later you look, the higher the shower's radiant in Perseus will be in the northeastern sky. — Jamie Carter You can also watch the Perseid meteor shower online for free with this livestream hosted by astrophysicist Gianluca Masi of the Virtual Telescope Project. The livestream will begin at 9 p.m. EDT on Aug. 12 (0100 GMT on Aug. 13). Tonight, the moon's eastern side will appear to be half-lit — its so-called first quarter phase — as it reaches its 90-degree angle away from the sun on its monthly orbit of Earth. Since a first-quarter moon always rises around midday and sets around midnight, it begins to bleach the evening night sky to make it more difficult to see stars (and \"shooting stars\" from the Perseid meteor shower). It's nevertheless a beautiful sight for the naked eye. — Jamie Carter There's no better time to see shooting stars from the northern hemisphere than tonight. At its peak, the annual Perseid meteor shower can produce around 60 meteors per hour visible in the night sky. The radiant point (where the meteors will appear to emanate from) will be the constellation Perseus, which will rise in the northeastern sky around midnight. Meteor showers can often be marred by strong moonlight, but not so the Perseids this year since the First Quarter Moon will set around midnight. Look skywards during the early hours of Monday for the best chance of shooting stars, though light pollution and the clarity of the sky will make a huge difference. If you can, get away from light pollution — at least 40 miles from a major urban area is wise — but wherever you watch from, make sure you don’t have any artificial lights in your line of sight. Sit back, relax in a lawn chair, keep warm, and take regular breaks. Never look at your smartphone; its white light will ruin your eyes' dark adaption, which takes about 20 minutes to cultivate and just a single second of white light to ruin. If you cannot look for Perseids in person, you can watch them live online here on Space.com courtesy of the Virtual Telescope Project. The first livestream will begin at 9 p.m. EDT on Aug. 11 (0100 GMT on Aug. 12,) the second will begin at 9 p.m. EDT on Aug. 12 (0100 GMT on Aug. 13) coinciding with the anticipated peak activity of the Perseid meteor shower. About a quarter of the moon's Earth-facing side is now lit by the sun. Across two nights, it will appear on either side of Spica. Arcturus in the constellation Boötes will appear directly above the pair, while to the south, the Milky Way will rise after dark. However, to see the arc of our galaxy, you'll need to be well away from light pollution. -- Jamie Carter Here's another chance to see the crescent moon dominating the post-sunset evening sky, with Venus shining stubbornly close to the western horizon. Look at the moon's dark left side. Can you make out any details? Since no sunlight shines directly on it, it should be dark, right? The light you can see is called \"Planet-shine,\" \"Earthshine,\" or \"Da Vinci Glow.\" It's sunlight shining on Earth and reflecting onto the moon. It's easiest to see in a crescent moon a few days old. -- Jamie Carter A brighter, more obvious crescent moon will tonight be positioned about halfway between Venus, to its lower right, and bright star Spica, to its upper left. One of the 20 brightest stars in the night sky, Spica is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo. -- Jamie Carter",

    "content": "Hey, space fans! If you're like me and love everything space, it's possible you've signed up to receive notifications from your favorite space news websites. Maybe even from Space.com? (If so, we thank you.) While it may be helpful to receive news and updates from those notifications, just like from your favorite apps, we understand that you may no longer want to receive them. Or perhaps you subscribed by mistake, started getting them on your computer or phone and want them gone. To take care of that, here's a handy guide on how to disable notifications in Google Chrome and Safari. If you're using Chrome, chances are it's linked to your phone or other personal device with the app and you may be getting notifications from a website across those platforms. These screenshots are from my laptop, so yours may look slightly different, but the process should be the same. The first step is to open Google Chrome on whatever device you're receiving notifications from. In the top right corner are three vertical dots, which you can click on to open up the main menu in Chrome. Click on 'Settings' to begin the process. Scroll down to the bottom and click on the section called 'Advanced.' Just beneath that is the 'Privacy and security' section, where you'll find a sub-section called 'Site Settings' (or 'Content Settings'). This is where you can turn off notifications. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Click on 'Site Settings' reach a new screen with a section clearly marked 'Notifications' next to an icon of a bell. Here, you can choose whether to allow websites to send you notifications outright, or enable a setting that says 'Ask before sending (recommended)'. It may already be enabled, and it's good to to keep it so. After all, asking permission to send notifications is the polite thing to do. That way, when a website asks permission, you'll receive a popup that asks to 'Allow' or 'Block' notifications. On this 'Notifications' page you can also select individual websites to either allow or block notifications. Simply scroll to the bottom under the section marked 'Allow' and click on the three vertical dots to the right side of a specific website. Here you can see choices to Block, Edit or Remove. Select 'Block' if you want to block the website from sending you notifications, as well as from asking again. 'Edit' will allow you change the website's name in your notifications, which we don't recommend. 'Remove' will stop notifications for now, but you may be asked again whether you want to subscribe in the future. This is a good choice if you're not 100% sure you don't want notifications forever. Since Chrome is connected to your Google account, if you make this change on one device, it should apply to all Chrome apps on your other devices. If you've blocked notifications to a site and you want to re-enable them, it's pretty simple. First, head back to the website. You'll likely be asked if you want to subscribe to notifications and can select 'Allow' to resume them. You can also select the padlock logo to the left the URL bar when on a website to access the 'Notifications' section for that website. There is a drop-down menu that has options for 'Ask (default)', 'Allow' or 'Block' and you can make your choice accordingly. If you're using Safari on a Mac, adjusting your notifications is a bit different. You'll need to open Safari preferences on a Mac, then find the option that says 'Websites' along the top of the screen. Click on 'Websites' and in the list on the left side you'll see an option marked 'Notifications'. Any sites you may be subscribed to will be shown here. You can select either 'Allow' or 'Deny' in a drop-down menu on the right side to change notifications settings for each of those sites. Select 'Deny' to stop notifications on your Safari device. And that's about it! I hope this helps and a huge thanks to my colleague James Peckham at our sister site Tech Radar for help with this guide.

    "content": "When it comes to saving Earth from a potential doomsday rock, knowing where to hit it and how it spins could make all the difference. Two new studies presented last month at the Europlanet Science Congress in Helsinki may have just given scientists both answers. In one study, researchers led by Wen-Han Zhou of the University of Tokyo used data from the European Space Agency's now-retired Gaia mission to study how an asteroid's spin depends on how often it's been hit by other space rocks. In another study, a team led by Rahil Makadia of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign developed a method for identifying the safest regions on an asteroid to strike with a deflection mission, without accidentally steering it back toward Earth. Together, the findings offer a new way to understand the structure and behavior of these ancient bodies — knowledge that could prove critical to deflecting a dangerous asteroid if it were ever on a collision course with our planet. \"By leveraging Gaia's unique dataset, advanced modelling and AI tools, we've revealed the hidden physics shaping asteroid rotation, and opened a new window into the interiors of these ancient worlds,\" Zhou said in a statement. In recent decades, astronomers have been puzzled by why some asteroids rotate like spinning tops while others tumble through space in chaotic, unpredictable ways. Zhou's team set out to solve that mystery using Gaia's vast archive of asteroid light patterns and new computer models. Their analysis showed that an asteroid's spin pattern boils down to a cosmic \"tug of war\" between two forces: collisions that knock them into unstable motion and internal friction that gradually smooths their rotation. \"When these two effects balance, they create a natural dividing line in the asteroid population,\" Zhou said in the statement. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Machine learning revealed this \"dividing line\" in Gaia's data as a clear gap between fast-spinning asteroids and slow, tumbling ones. Slower rotators, the researchers found, are more easily jolted into a wobble by impacts, while faster ones resist those disturbances, according to the statement. Sunlight also plays a subtle but important role, the study reports. As an asteroid's surface heats up during the day and cools at night, it emits tiny bursts of radiation that act like microscopic thrusts. For smoothly spinning asteroids, those pushes line up in the same direction and gradually change their spin rate. But for tumblers, the pushes more or less cancel each other out, trapping them in their slow, chaotic motion. The results also indicate that many asteroids aren't solid chunks of rock, but loose clusters of rock and dust held together weakly by gravity, known to astronomers as \"rubble piles.\" That distinction matters for planetary defense, scientists say, because a fragile, porous asteroid would react to a spacecraft's impact very differently than a dense, solid one. As more sky surveys come online, scientists will be able to apply this method to much larger samples, Zhou said in the statement. With upcoming observatories such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, \"we'll be able to apply this method to millions more asteroids, refining our understanding of their evolution and make-up.\" If knowing how an asteroid spins is the first step, the next is figuring out where to hit it. Makadia's team investigated what happens when a spacecraft slams into an asteroid, and found that not all impact sites are created equal. Striking the wrong spot could send an asteroid drifting into what scientists call a gravitational keyhole — a tiny region of space where a planet's gravity could subtly bend the asteroid's orbit and make it swing back toward Earth on a future pass decades or centuries later. \"Even if we intentionally push an asteroid away from Earth with a space mission, we must make sure it doesn't drift into one of these keyholes afterwards,\" Makadia said in a different statement. \"Otherwise, we'd be facing the same impact threat again down the line.\" To avoid such a cosmic boomerang effect, Makadia's team created probability maps of asteroid surfaces that could guide mission planners. Using lessons from NASA's DART mission, which slammed into the asteroid Dimorphos in September 2022, and realistic spacecraft trajectories, they simulated hundreds of millions of kinetic-impact missions, each varying slightly in speed, angle and timing. For each simulation, they calculated how an asteroid's motion would change, and whether it might drift into one of these gravitational keyholes. Repeating this process for a range of impact points and rotation angles allowed them to pinpoint the safest and most effective strike zones, according to the second statement. \"With these probability maps, we can push asteroids away while preventing them from returning on an impact trajectory, protecting the Earth in the long run,\" said Makadia. To test their model, the researchers applied it to the near-Earth asteroid Bennu, one of the best-studied near-Earth objects thanks to NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission, which precisely mapped its surface, studied its orbit and brought a sample of the space rock home to Earth. Earlier models had shown that Bennu's path included several potential gravitational keyholes that could, in theory, redirect it toward Earth sometime in the 22nd century. But data from OSIRIS-REx dramatically reduced those uncertainties, ruling out many potential keyholes and future impact scenarios. Using that precise orbital data, Makadia's team simulated spacecraft impacts under a variety of conditions and projected Bennu's potential keyhole encounters, creating detailed impact-probability maps. These maps show which areas on an asteroid would make the safest targets, and which regions could increase the long-term risk of a future encounter, the study notes. The optimal strike zones, marked as bright crosshairs in the model, show where a spacecraft could nudge an asteroid's orbit away from Earth without triggering a dangerous return later on. — Planetary defense: Protecting Earth from space-based threats — NASA's DART asteroid-smashing mission: The ultimate guide According to the study, this kind of analysis could help design safer deflection missions even using only ground-based observations, when time doesn't allow for a dedicated rendezvous spacecraft. \"Fortunately, this entire analysis, at least at a preliminary level, is possible using ground-based observations alone, although a rendezvous mission is preferred,\" Makadia said in the statement. As next-generation telescopes and missions uncover millions more asteroids, studies like these are helping scientists write a planetary defense blueprint to safeguard Earth.

    "content": "The solar system is our cosmic neighborhood, made up of the sun and everything that orbits it — planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and even dust and gas. The order of the planets in the solar system, starting nearest the sun and working outward, is the following: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and then the possible Planet Nine. It's a dynamic system shaped by gravity and time, and while we've learned a lot, it still holds plenty of mysteries. In this guide, we'll explore how the solar system formed, its structure, and the many fascinating objects it contains. The solar system is a collection of celestial objects bound to the sun by gravity. At the center is the sun, a yellow dwarf star that contains 99.8% of the solar system's mass. Everything else — from the eight major planets to dwarf planets, comets, asteroids, and icy objects — revolves around it. The solar system also includes the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud, which are distant regions filled with small icy bodies and long-period comets. Related: 10 incredible volcanoes in our solar system The solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a giant rotating cloud of gas and dust known as the solar nebula. Gravity caused the nebula to collapse in on itself, forming a dense, hot core that ignited to become the sun. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! The remaining material flattened into a spinning disk. Through a process called accretion, particles in this disk began sticking together, forming planetesimals — the building blocks of planets. Over millions of years, these objects grew larger, sweeping up material in their orbits and becoming the planets we know today. This model of solar system formation is known as the nebular hypothesis. The solar system is structured in a roughly flat plane called the ecliptic, with most planets orbiting the sun in the same direction (counterclockwise, as viewed from above the sun's north pole). It can be divided into several key regions: This area includes the four terrestrial (rocky) planets: These planets are smaller, denser, and closer to the sun. The region also contains the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, where many rocky remnants from the early solar system reside. Beyond the asteroid belt are the gas and ice giants: These planets are much larger and mostly composed of hydrogen, helium, and ices like water, methane, and ammonia. They also have extensive systems of rings and moons. The Kuiper Belt is a donut-shaped region beyond Neptune, extending roughly 30 to 55 astronomical units (AU) from the sun. It contains thousands of icy bodies, including dwarf planets like Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris. Many Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) are remnants from the solar system's formation and help astronomers study its early history. Far beyond the Kuiper Belt lies the hypothetical Oort Cloud, a spherical shell of icy objects believed to surround the solar system at distances up to 100,000 AU. Though we've never directly observed it, the Oort Cloud is thought to be the source of long-period comets that take thousands of years to orbit the sun. Here's a quick overview of the eight official planets, listed in order from the sun: A common mnemonic to remember the order is: \"My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Noodles.\" If you were to order the planets by size from smallest to largest they would be Mercury, Mars, Venus, Earth, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn and Jupiter. We asked Maximilian Guenther, ESA Project Scientist and mission representative of ESA's Characterising Exoplanet Satellite (CHEOPS) mission a few frequently asked questions about solar systems. I am the European Space Agency (ESA) Project Scientist and Mission Representative of CHEOPS (the Charactersing Exoplanets Satellite), and a science team member of several other space- and ground-based telescopes. I am fascinated by our quest to find Earth-sized exoplanets around small stars, and the big question of how stellar flares impact their habitability. Whenever I am not searching for new worlds, I enjoy exploring our own Earth, travelling, and the outdoors (scuba diving, rock climbing and hiking). Yes, so many! If you had asked anyone just 30 years ago, the answer would have been \"we don’t know\". But since then we have discovered already more than 5,000 planets orbiting stars other than our sun (so-called exoplanets). And since often we find multiple of them orbiting the same star, we can count about 4,000 other solar systems. Absolutely, and in many ways. For one, all the exoplanets orbit their stars, just like our planets (such as Earth and Mars) orbit our sun. In addition, our solar system as well as all of the others orbit around the black hole in the centre of the Milky Way! But what is even more, some of these other solar systems actually have not one, but two or more stars (like Tatooine!) — and then these stars perform a rhythmic dance around each other, together with their exoplanets. That is the 1 million Euro question. We are currently just exploring what processes drive the formation and evolution of other solar systems, and what we can learn from this about our own solar systems (and Earth’s!) history. We think that many other stars have exoplanets around them but probably not all of them. In average, studies found there to be about 1 to 2 exoplanet per star — but that is an average! Some stars may have 8, others may have none. The IAU defines a true planet as a body that circles the sun without being some other object's satellite; is large enough to be rounded by its own gravity (but not so big that it begins to undergo nuclear fusion, like a star); and has \"cleared its neighborhood\" of most other orbiting bodies. But that restrictive definition helped isolate what should and should not be considered a planet — a problem that arose as astronomers discovered more and more planet-like objects in the solar system. Pluto was among the bodies that didn't make the cut and was re-classified as a dwarf planet. The problem with Pluto, aside from its small size and offbeat orbit, is that it doesn't clear its neighborhood of debris — it shares its space with lots of other objects in the Kuiper Belt. Still, the demotion of Pluto remains controversial. — Kepler's Third Law: The movement of solar system planets — Sounds in space: What noises do planets make? — The 10 most Earth-like exoplanets The IAU planet definition also put other small, round worlds into the dwarf planet category, including the Kuiper Belt objects Eris, Haumea and Makemake. Ceres, a round object in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter, also got the boot. Ceres was considered a planet when it was discovered in 1801, but it was later deemed to be an asteroid. That still didn't quite fit because it was so much larger (and rounder) than the other asteroids. Astronomers instead deemed it a dwarf planet in 2006, although some astronomers like to consider Ceres as a 10th planet (not to be confused with Nibiru or Planet X). Below is a brief overview of the eight true planets in our solar system, moving from that closest to the sun to the farthest from the sun: The sun is by far the largest object in our solar system, containing 99.8% of the solar system's mass. It sheds most of the heat and light that makes life possible on Earth and possibly elsewhere. Planets orbit the sun in oval-shaped paths called ellipses, with the sun slightly off-center of each ellipse. NASA has a fleet of spacecraft observing the sun, such as the Parker Solar Probe, to learn more about its composition, and to make better predictions about space weather and its effect on Earth. Related: Solar eclipses: When, where & how to see them Mercury is the closest planet to the sun and the smallest planet in the solar system — it is only a little larger than Earth's moon. Mercury zips around the sun in only 88 days and because it is so close to our star (about two-fifths the distance between Earth and the sun). Mercury experiences dramatic changes in its day and night temperatures. Mercury temperatures can reach a scorching 840 F (450 C) in the day, which is hot enough to melt lead. Meanwhile, on the night side, temperatures drop to minus 290 F (minus 180 C). - Discovery: Known to the ancient Greeks and visible to the naked eye - Named for the messenger of the Roman gods - Diameter: 3,031 miles (4,878 km) Mercury's atmosphere is very thin and primarily composed of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium and potassium. Because the atmosphere is so thin it cannot deflect incoming meteors, its surface is therefore pockmarked with craters, just like our moon. Over its four-year mission, NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft revealed incredible discoveries that challenged astronomers' expectations. Among those findings was the discovery of water ice and frozen organic compounds at Mercury's north pole and that volcanism played a major role in shaping the planet's surface. Venus is the second planet from the sun and is the hottest planet in the solar system. Its thick atmosphere is extremely toxic and composed of sulfuric acid clouds, the planet is an extreme example of the greenhouse effect. - Named for the Roman goddess of love and beauty - Diameter: 7,521 miles (12,104 km) The average temperature on Venus' surface is 900 F (465 C). At 92 bar, the pressure at the surface would crush and kill you. And oddly, Venus spins slowly from east to west, the opposite direction of most of the other planets. Venus is sometimes referred to as Earth's twin as they are similar in size and radar images beneath its atmosphere reveal numerous mountains and volcanoes. But beyond that, the planets could not be more different. The Greeks believed Venus was two different objects — one in the morning sky and another in the evening. Because it is often brighter than any other object in the sky, Venus has generated many UFO reports. Earth, our home planet, is the third planet from the sun. It is a water world with two-thirds of the planet covered by water. Earth's atmosphere is rich in nitrogen and oxygen and it is the only world known to harbor life. - Name originates from \"Die Erde,\" the German word for \"the ground.\" - Diameter: 7,926 miles (12,760 km) Earth rotates on its axis at 1,532 feet per second (467 meters per second) — slightly more than 1,000 mph (1,600 kph) — at the equator. The planet zips around the sun at more than 18 miles per second (29 km per second). Related: 10 Earth impact craters you must see Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It is a cold, desert-like planet covered in iron oxide dust that gives the planet its signature red hue. Mars shares similarities with Earth: It is rocky, has mountains, valleys and canyons, and storm systems ranging from localized tornado-like dust devils to planet-engulfing dust storms. Substantial scientific evidence suggests that Mars at one point billions of years ago was a much warmer, wetter world, rivers and maybe even oceans existed. Although Mars' atmosphere is too thin for liquid water to exist on the surface for any length of time, remnants of that wetter Mars still exist today. Sheets of water ice the size of California lie beneath Mars' surface, and at both poles are ice caps made in part of frozen water. - Named for the Roman god of war - Diameter: 4,217 miles (6,787 km) - Day: Just more than one Earth day (24 hours, 37 minutes) Scientists also think ancient Mars would have had the conditions to support life like bacteria and other microbes. Hope that signs of this past life — and the possibility of even current lifeforms — may exist on the Red Planet has driven numerous Mars missions and the Red Planet is now one of the most explored planets in the solar system. Related: How long does it take to get to Mars? Between Mars and Jupiter lies the asteroid belt. Asteroids are minor planets, and according to NASA there are approximately between 1.1 and 1.9 million asteroids in the main asteroid belt larger than 0.6 miles (1 km) in diameter and millions more smaller asteroids. The dwarf planet Ceres, about 590 miles (950 km) in diameter, resides here. A number of asteroids have orbits that take them closer into the solar system that sometimes lead them to collide with Earth or the other inner planets. Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun and the largest planet in the solar system. The gas giant is more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined, according to NASA. - Named for the ruler of the Roman gods - Diameter: 86,881 miles (139,822 km) - Number of moons: 95 confirmed Its swirling clouds are colorful due to different types of trace gases including ammonia ice, ammonium hydrosulfide crystals as well as water ice and vapor. A famous feature in its swirling clouds is Jupiter's Great Red Spot, a giant storm more than 10,000 miles wide, first observed in 1831 by amateur astronomer Samuel Heinrich Schwabe. It has raged at more than 400 mph for the last 150 years, at least. Jupiter has 95 moons, including the largest moon in the solar system, Ganymede. Related: Jupiter's moons: Facts about the largest Jovian moons Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun and is famous for its large and distinct ring system. Though Saturn is not the only planet in the solar system with rings. - Named for Roman god of agriculture - Diameter: 74,900 miles (120,500 km) If you put Saturn in a bathtub it would float as Saturn has an average density that is less than water. You'd just need to find a bathtub big enough… When polymath Galileo Galilei first studied Saturn in the early 1600s, he thought it was an object with three parts: a planet and two large moons on either side. Not knowing he was seeing a planet with rings, the stumped astronomer entered a small drawing — a symbol with one large circle and two smaller ones — in his notebook, as a noun in a sentence describing his discovery. More than 40 years later, Christiaan Huygens proposed that they were rings. The rings are made of ice and rock and scientists are not yet sure how they formed. The gaseous planet is mostly hydrogen and helium and has numerous moons. Related: How far away is Saturn? Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun and is a bit of an oddball. It has clouds made of hydrogen sulfide, the same chemical that makes rotten eggs smell so foul. It rotates from east to west like Venus. But unlike Venus or any other planet, its equator is nearly at right angles to its orbit — it basically orbits on its side. - Discovery: 1781 by William Herschel (was originally thought to be a star) - Named for the personification of heaven in ancient myth - Diameter: 31,763 miles (51,120 km) Astronomers believe an object twice the size of Earth collided with Uranus roughly 4 billion years ago, causing Uranus to tilt. That tilt causes extreme seasons that last 20-plus years and the sun beats down on one pole or the other for 84 Earth years at a time. The collision is also thought to have knocked rock and ice into Uranus' orbit. These later became some of the planet's 28 moons. Methane in Uranus' atmosphere gives the planet its blue-green tint. It also has 13 sets of faint rings. Uranus holds the record for the coldest temperature ever measured in the solar system — minus 371.56 degrees F (minus 224.2 degrees C). The average temperature of Uranus is minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit (-195 degrees Celsius). Neptune is the eighth planet from the sun and is on average the coldest planet in the solar system. The average temperature of Neptune at the top of the clouds is minus 346 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 210 degrees Celsius). - Named for the Roman god of water - Diameter: 30,775 miles (49,530 km) Neptune is approximately the same size as Uranus and is known for its supersonic strong winds. The planet is more than 30 times as far from the sun as Earth. Neptune was the first planet predicted to exist by using math, rather than being visually detected. Irregularities in the orbit of Uranus led French astronomer Alexis Bouvard to suggest some other planet might be exerting a gravitational tug. German astronomer Johann Galle used calculations to help find Neptune in a telescope. Neptune is about 17 times as massive as Earth and has a rocky core. Related: There's something strange going on inside Neptune Astronomers had long suspected that a band of icy material known as the Kuiper Belt existed past the orbit of Neptune extending from about 30 to 55 times the distance of Earth to the sun, and from the last decade of the 20th century up to now, they have found more than a thousand of such objects. Scientists estimate the Kuiper Belt is likely home to hundreds of thousands of icy bodies larger than 60 miles (100 km) wide, as well as an estimated trillion or more comets. Pluto, now considered a dwarf planet, dwells in the Kuiper Belt. It is not alone — recent additions include Makemake, Haumea and Eris. Another Kuiper Belt object dubbed Quaoar is probably massive enough to be considered a dwarf planet, but it has not been classified as such yet. Sedna, which is about three-fourths the size of Pluto, is the first dwarf planet discovered in the Oort Cloud. NASA's New Horizons mission performed history's first flyby of the Pluto system on July 14, 2015. Pluto was once the ninth planet from the sun and is unlike any other planet in the solar system. - Discovery: 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh - Named for the Roman god of the underworld, Hades - Diameter: 1,430 miles (2,301 km) It is smaller than Earth's moon; its orbit is highly elliptical, falling inside Neptune's orbit at some points and far beyond it at others; and Pluto's orbit doesn't fall on the same plane as all the other planets — instead, it orbits 17.1 degrees above or below, taking 288 years to complete a single orbit according to ESA. From 1979 until early 1999, Pluto had been the eighth planet from the sun. Then, on Feb. 11, 1999, it crossed Neptune's path and once again became the solar system's most distant planet — until it was redefined as a dwarf planet. It's a cold, rocky world with a tenuous atmosphere. Scientists thought it might be nothing more than a hunk of rock on the outskirts of the solar system. But when NASA's New Horizons mission performed history's first flyby of the Pluto system on July 14, 2015, it transformed scientists' view of Pluto. Pluto is a very active ice world that's covered in glaciers, mountains of ice water, icy dunes and possibly even cryovolcanoes that erupt icy lava made of water, methane or ammonia. Related: Why isn't Pluto a planet anymore? In 2016, researchers proposed the possible existence of a ninth planet, for now, dubbed \"Planet Nine\" or Planet X. The planet is estimated to be about 10 times the mass of Earth and to orbit the sun between 300 and 1,000 times farther than the orbit of the Earth. Scientists have not seen Planet Nine. They inferred its existence by its gravitational effects on other objects in the Kuiper Belt, a region at the fringe of the solar system that is home to icy rocks left over from the birth of the solar system. Also called trans-Neptunian objects, these Kuiper Belt objects have highly elliptical or oval orbits that align in the same direction. Scientists Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena described the evidence for Planet Nine in a study published in the Astronomical Journal. The research is based on mathematical models and computer simulations using observations of six other smaller Kuiper Belt Objects with orbits that aligned in a similar matter. A hypothesis proposed in September 2019 on the pre-print server arXiv suggests Planet Nine might not be a planet at all. Instead, Jaku Scholtz of Durham University and James Unwin of the University of Illinois at Chicago speculate it could be a primordial black hole that formed soon after the Big Bang and that our solar system later captured, according to Newsweek. Unlike black holes that form from the collapse of giant stars, primordial black holes are thought to have formed from gravitational perturbations less than a second after the Big Bang, and this one would be so small (5 centimeters in diameter) that it would be challenging to detect. Astronomers continue to come up empty in their search for Planet 9. A recent 2022 sky survey using the 6-meter Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in Chile found thousands of tentative candidate sources but none could be confirmed. Related: The nonexistent planet Nibiru Past the Kuiper Belt is the very edge of the solar system, the heliosphere, a vast, teardrop-shaped region of space containing electrically charged particles given off by the sun. Many astronomers think that the limit of the heliosphere, known as the heliopause, is about 9 billion miles (15 billion km) from the sun. The Oort Cloud lies well past the Kuiper Belt, considered to be located between 2,000 and 5,000 astronomical units (AU) from the sun. The outer edge of the Oort Cloud may reach as far as 10,000 up to 100,000 AU from the sun. One AU is equal to approximately 93,000,000 miles (150 million kilometers). The Oort Cloud is home to billions, or even trillions of objects, according to NASA Science. But where exactly is the edge of the solar system? Well, it depends on your criteria. If you base it on where the planet's end you would say the edge is Neptune and the Kuiper Belt. If based on the edge of the sun's magnetic field then it ends at the heliosphere. But if you judge it by the endpoint of the sun's gravitational influence, the solar system ends at the Oort Cloud, according to NASA. From the sun outward: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 because it does not meet all the criteria set by the International Astronomical Union. Specifically, it hasn't cleared its orbit of other debris. Beyond Neptune is the Kuiper Belt, home to many icy bodies including Pluto. Even farther out is the theoretical Oort Cloud, thought to be a source of long-period comets. There are five officially recognized dwarf planets: Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Ceres. Many more are likely awaiting classification. Despite not being the closest to the sun, Venus is the hottest planet due to its thick atmosphere and runaway greenhouse effect.

This clip from the upcoming season 4 premiere episode finds the Enterprise crew observing a spectacular cosmic storm. When they receive an SOS message from a starship distress buoy inside that fiery interstellar maelstrom, Pike and his crew plunge directly into the churning plasma only to become marooned and drained of Iridium within a warp field. Their only hope of survival is to locate a high-grade source of the essential element to repair their ailing vessel. \"Well, Number One, you wanted a mission on a strange new world? Looks like you got one,\" Pike tells his loyal second in command (he said the line!) as they discover a nearby planet that just might save them. As a spinoff of \"Star Trek: Discovery\" created by Akiva Goldsman and Henry Alonso Myers, \"Strange New Worlds\" is a return to the classic \"planet of the week\" episodic formula seen in \"Star Trek: The Original Series,\" with some amusing gimmicky genre episodes tossed in for variety and good old-fashioned fun. Season 3's talent roster included Anson Mount (Captain Christopher Pike), Ethan Peck (Spock), Celia Rose Gooding (Nyota Uhura), Rebecca Romijn (Number One), Jess Bush (Nurse Christine Chapel), Christina Chong (La’An Noonien-Singh), Melissa Navia (Erica Ortegas), and Babs Olusanmokun (Dr. M’Benga). We also saw some returning stars in the wider lineup, including Paul Wesley (James T. Kirk), Melanie Scrofano (Marie Batel), Martin Quinn (Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott), and Carol Kane (Pelia), alongside newcomer Cillian O’Sullivan (Dr. Roger Korby). Despite the clip being named a \"first peek,\" that's not entirely accurate — fans were gifted a hilarious look at Season 4 this past summer at San Diego Comic Con when an all-puppet episode was teased starring a felt and cloth version of Captain Christopher Pike.

SpaceX successfully launched the 11th Starship test flight on Oct. 13, 2025. Read our full preview story for the upcoming Starship launch and see how the most recent Starship Flight 10 launch went. Flight 11 webcast | 1st Starship capture | Starship & Super Heavy SpaceX's Starship Flight 11 upper stage, Ship 38, successfully landed and splashed down in the Indian Ocean, marking an end for today's test flight. Read our wrap story here.\"We promised maximum excitement and Starship delivered,\" Jake Berkowitz, a Raptor engine team lead propulsion engineer on SpaceX's Raptor engine team, said after splashdown. Ship 38 performed a series of aggressive reentry tests on this flight, including a \"dynamic banking maneuver\" designed to simulate a controlled approach to a landing tower for eventual recovery using launch pad arms like those used to catch returning Super Heavy boosters. SpaceX also removed protective heat tiles from many sections of Ship 38 to see study reentry heating effects. The spacecraft also successully deployed eight Starlink V3 satellite simulators, a repeat test from Flight 10 (but much smoother), as well as restarted an engine on Ship 38 as part of reentry and orbital manueuvering demonsrations (another repeat test). The Super Heavy booster on this flight also performed new tests, including a 13-engine landing burn followed by a successful splashdown. Today's Flight 11 test was the fifth Starship launch of 2025 and the last-ever planned flight using SpaceX's Starship Version 2 design. The next Starship to fligh will be Version 3, which will include new upgrades and enhancements developed as a result of the ongoing test flight program. It was also the last flight from Starbase's Pad 1, with SpaceX closing the pad temporarily to upgrade it as well in order to handle future flights by the Version 3 Starships to come. Thanks for following Starship Flight 11 with our team here at Space.com. Our wrap story by Spaceflight Editor Mike Wall will be posted shortly. -- Tariq Malik, Editor-in-Chief SpaceX's Starship Flight 11 upper stage, Ship 38, is undergoing peak heating as it streaks toward its splashdown flight. So far, the ship's heat shield, particularly around its flaps, appears to be holding up well. On Flight 10, some damage to the Ship's aft skirt and flaps was noticed at this point. SpaceX reports a successful Raptor engine relight test on the Starship Flight 11 Ship 38, with the spacecraft no reentering Earth's atmosphere over the Indian Ocean. Live views via Starlink communications show a red glow around the vehicle and real-time views of its heat shield tiles, which are being tested in different configurations on this test. SpaceX's Ship 38 has successfully deployed its Starlink satellite simulators, 8 in all. So far, the deployment has been faster and smoother than a similar test on Flight 10.Starship's Starlink deployment system spits the flat satellites out like a giant Pexz candy dispenser through a slim door on the hull of the spacecraft. That payload door has just closed for the remainder of the flight. The next milestone will be Raptor engine relight, to restart one of the ship's engines in a deorbit maneuver test, and then reentry and splashdown. SpaceX's Starship Flight 11 Super Heavy booster successfully executed a landing burn and splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico in a successful test of a new technique for future landings that uses 13 engines during the final burn. The booster hovered briefly over its target zone, then fell into the gulf as planned. The Starship Ship 38 upper stage, meanwhile, continued its ascent to space using is 6 Raptor engines. It reached its target altitude and a successul engine shudown, entering a coast phase for today's flight, which should last about an hour. The next mission milestone will come at about 7:39 p.m. EDT, 16 minutes into flight, for the Starlink V3 deployment demonstration. Flight 11 is carrying 8 Starlink V3 satellite simulators as on Flight 10. SpaceX's Starship Flight 11 Ship 38 and Super Heavy booster successully separated during their now typical \"hot-stage\" manuever. The Super Heavy booster is headed toward a landing sight in the Gulf of Mexico, the Ship is still headed toward space. Liftoff! SpaceX launches Starship Flight 11! SpaceX is now less than 3 minutes from launch, with fueling nearly complete of its 11 million pounds of liquid methane and liquid oxygen propellant. The launch range is green, weather is go and SpaceX is tracking no issues for launch. Liftoff is set for 7:23 p.m. EDT (2323 GMT). SpaceX is now less than 20 minutes from the launch of its Starship Flight 11 test flight, with liftoff set for 7:23 p.m. EDT (2323 GMT). SpaceX CEO and founder Elon Musk just dropped in behind the company's commentators in a brief cameo. \"This is really the first time I'm going to be outside and watching the rocket,\" Musk said. \"It's going to be much more visceral.\"SpaceX confirmed that today's launch will mark the final flight of the the Starship version 2 design, as well as the last flight from Pad 1 at Starbase before a refit for future flights. The next launches will feature Starship's version 3, and lift off from the new Pad 2 at Starbase. SpaceX has confirmed that fueling is now also underway on the Flight 11 Super Heavy booster. This is a veteran Super Heavy booster that flew earlier this year. Twenty four of its 33 Raptor engines have flown before. SpaceX has begun loading Starship Flight 11's Ship and Super Heavy booster with their liquid methane propellant. SpaceX begins fueling the Ship first, then the Super Heavy booster. SpaceX just announced it is \"go\" for Starship Flight 11 fueling and has refined its launch time a few minutes into the window. The new liftoff time is now about 7:23 p.m. EDT (2323 GMT) from Starbase near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. SpaceX's launch window runs through 8:30 p.m. EDT (0030 GMT) tonight, about 75 minutes long. \"The Starship team is go for prop load,\" SpaceX wrote on X. SpaceX is counting down toward its next Starship test flight tonight. The mission, called Flight 11, is scheduled to lift off no earlier than 7:15 p.m. EDT (2315 GMT). A launch webcast could begin at 6:45 p.m. EDT (2245 GMT). You can watch the launch live here on Space.com about 30 minutes before liftoff. The upcoming Starship Flight 11 test flight will mark SpaceX's 11th test of its massive Starship and Super Heavy booster, which together are the world's largest and most powerful rocket. Starship Flight 11 will use a veteran Super Heavy booster and 24 flight-proven Raptor engines. The Super Heavy will not be recaptured after launch, and will instead make a soft-landing and splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico tp end its mission. The Ship stage of Starship, meanwhile, is expeted to make an hourlong flight to the Indian Ocean and deploy 8 Starlink satellite simulators along the way. SpaceX is hoping to test new heat shield designs and other techniques needed to eventually return the Ship to Earth for a capture at its launch site, much like the Super Heavy catches SpaceX has demonstrated. During reentry, Ship will attempt a \"dynamic banking maneuver and will test subsonic guidance algorithms prior to a landing burn and splashdown in the Indian Ocean,\" during the flight. SpaceX's Starship Flight 10 ship made an on target \"soft landing\" and splashdown before tipping over and exploding in views from SpaceX's Buoycam to end what appears to be a successful Flight 10 test flight. Read our full story here. \"That was absolutely incredible,\" SpaceX Build Reliability Engineer Amanda Lee said during live commentary. \"A huge congrats to all the teams here.\" SpaceX has concluded its live launch webcast. Thank you all for joining us. This will end our live commentary tonight of SpaceX\"s Starship Flight 10. Thanks for tuning in and we'll see you soon for Starship Flight 11! -- Tariq Malik, Space.com Editor-in-Chief SpaceX's Starship Flight 10 Ship has survived its peak heating and is now nearing landing burn and splashdown. Some burnthrough on the flaps, but it did maintain control of the ship. SpaceX's Starship is now reentering Earth's atmosphere for a planned soft-landing and splashdown in the Indian Ocean. Part of the aft skirt suffered some damage, but the vehicle is still making its descent. Starship Reentering Atmosphere: @SpaceX's Starship is now reentering Earth's atmosphere for a planned soft-landing and splashdown in the Indian Ocean. Part of the aft skirt suffered some damage, but the vehicle is still making its descent. #starship10 pic.twitter.com/4McrMfAhtNAugust 27, 2025 SpaceX's Starship Flight 10 Ship just fired up a single Raptor engine in a critical reignition test, completing the spacecraft's in-space demonstrations for today's flight. Such engine reingnitions are needed to ensure Starship can conduct deorbit burns to control its return to Earth for reentry and landings. With its payload deployment test complete, SpaceX's Starship Flight 10 Ship is now coasting in space ahead of its next milestone: a Raptor engine relight to show the spacecraft can adjust its orbit. SpaceX's Starship Flight 10 Ship has successfully deployed all 8 of its Starlink satellite simulators in what seems like a fairly smooth test of the Pez dispenser-like deployment system on Starship. SpaceX hopes to launch batches of 60 Starlink Version 3 internet satellites at a time using Starship as a workhorse launch vehicle. In a major milestone for today's SpaceX's Starship test flight, SpaceX's Ship upper stage has begun deploying the eight Starlink satellite simulators. The spacecraft has spit out four of the satellites, which are in a flat stack, much like a Pez candy dispenser at a rate of about one per minute. SpaceX's Starship Flight 10 Ship upper stage has shut down its engines and is now coasting in space, a major milestone for today's test flight. The next milestone will be the deployment of 8 Starlink simulators at the 18-minute mark of the flight. SpaceX's Starship Super Heavy booster has successfully made a soft landing and splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico after a smooth launch and stage separation. The 33-engine rocket lost one engine during launch, but it did not appear to affect the flight or landing. SpaceX's Starship Super Heavy booster has separated from its Ship upper stage in a hot staging event to return to Earth for a landing and splashdown. With a mighty roar, SpaceX's Starship Super Heavy booster ignited its 33 main engines on time and is soaring spaceward for a liftoff of SpaceX's Fligth 10 test flight. The towering rocket, standing over 400 feet tall, will take just over 2.5 minutes to separate its first stage and upper Ship stage in a hot staging event. T-5 minutes to go for SpaceX's Starship Flight 10 test flight at 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT). All systems are GO for launch. No issues, weather looks good. SpaceX reports that weather is now GO for today's Starship Flight 10 launch at 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT). 10 minutes remain to launch. \"Surprise, everything is looking green today,\" SpaceX's Dan Huot says. \"weather is the main watch item for today, but we are green right now. We're not tracking any issues with the vehicle or ground systems, so we are looking pretty good for launch.\" SpaceX is now less than 20 minutes from its Starship Flight 10 test flight. SpaceX reports a smooth countdown so far, with just an eye on the weather, much like yesterday's countdown. Starship Flight 10 will is carrying 8 Starlink satellite dummy payloads that, SpaceX hopes, will be deployed in a test by the Ship upper stage during flight. There are 4 Starlink systems on the Starship stack to offer live views from both stages during the mission. Liftoff remains on target for 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT). We are now 30 minutes and counting to the launch of Starship Flight 10 and SpaceX reports the fueling is underway now for the massive Super Heavy booster, the first stage that will power Starship's liftoff and initial ascent toward space. Fueling is underway to load SpaceX's Starship Flight 10 Ship and Super Heavy booster with the massive amount of liquid methane and liquid oxygen needed for its launch today at 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT) from the company's Starbase facility near Brownsville, Texas. SpaceX's launch webcast is now underway as well, and you can watch it at the top of this page. All systems appear to be working well, with SpaceX watching weather conditions. There is a 55% chance of good weather for launch. SpaceX flight controllers have cleared Starship Flight 10 for fueling and say the weather forecase has improved slightly. \"The Starship team is go for prop load. Weather is now 55% favorable for liftoff at the opening of the launch window.\" SpaceX wrote in an update on X. Earlier, SpaceX reported only a 45% chance of good weather. Liftoff remains on target for 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT), with a live launch webcast to begin at 6:40 p.m. EDT (2240 GMT). SpaceX has updated its launch livestream timing for today's Starship Flight 10 launch at 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT). The launch webcast will now begin at 6:40 p.m. EDT (2240 GMT), about 15 minutes earlier than planned. Tune in! SpaceX is counting down toward the launch of its Flight 10 Starship test mission for the third day in a row today (Aug. 26), but the weather outlook is grim. \"Weather is currently 45% favorable for launch in the 60-minute window,\" SpaceX officials wrote on X in an update at 5:33 p.m. EDT (2133 GMT). The launch window opens at 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT). Today's launch attempt follows two scrubbed attempts by SpaceX to launch Fligth 10 after ground system issue prevented a launch on Sunday, Aug. 24, and bad weather prevented liftoff a day later. Today's launch is a critical test flight for Starship, the 10th such flight for the company. It will not include a Super Heavy booster catch, instead ditching the booster in the Gulf of Mexico after a soft landing. SpaceX hopes the Ship upper stage will successfully deploy eight Starslink demonstrator payloads, relight its Raptor engine in space and then make a controlled landing and splashdown in the Indian Ocean. After two days of delays, first due to a technical glitchand then due to weather, SpaceX is once again preparing to launch its Starship Flight 10 test mission today (Aug. 26). Liftoff is set for no earlier than 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT), as in the last two attempts. You can watch live starting at about 6:55 p.m. EDT (2255 GMT). SpaceX will have a one-hour launch window in which to launch Starship Flight 10 and is hoping for better weather this time around. Thick anvil clouds prompted a lightning risk for a launch try on Monday. A ground systems issue prevented a Sunday liftoff. Flight 10 is SpaceX's 10th Starship test flight and the fourth such test launch for the company this year. All three Starship test flights of 2025 to date, Flight 7, Flight 8 and Flight 9 in January, March and May, respectively, failed to meet their primary objectives so SpaceX is hoping for better performance by the Ship and Super Heavy on this flight. SpaceX just called off the launch of its Starship Flight 10 test mission due to bad weather at its Starbase launch site in South Texas due to an anvil cloud rule prohibiting launches when such clouds near the launch site. \"So sad news, not going to launch today. Weather got in our way,\" SpaceX spokesperson Dan Huot says. \"Very good chance that we could try again tomorrow.\" Huot says the company will asses its propellant supplies and other logistics to determine its next launch date, but the company could potentially try again on Tuesday (Aug. 26). SpaceX has completed the fueling of its Starship Flight 10 rocket, completing the load of liquid methane and liquid oxygen that will feed its Raptor engines. The weather is still no-go for launch, SpaceX's Dan Huot says.The launch countdown clock is now holding at T-40 seconds as SpaceX waits for weather conditions to clear. Today's launch window runs through 8:30 p.m. EDT (0030 GMT). Weather is currently RED (no go) for Starship Flight 10, SpaceX says. Fueling is going smoothly, no technical issues with the rocket. So all eyes are on the weather. \"That's the only thing that could potentially stop us today,\" SpaceX's Dan Huot says. SpaceX is fueling its Starship Flight 10 megarocket with the propellant needed for today's launch at 7:59 p.m. EDT (2359 GMT). Everything appears to be going well for the mission. So far, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Bill Riley, vice president of Starship operations, have been outlining the status of Starship and the immediate next steps, such as demonstrations for in-space refueling and a capability to land Starship Ships at their launch pads like Super Heavy rockets, in order to help NASA land Artemis astronauts on the moon and send people to Mars. SpaceX just announced a new launch time for Starship Flight 10. Liftoff is now set for 7:59 p.m. EDT (2359 GMT). The company is watching some weather concerns for the launch, officials have said. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is cohosting the launch webcast and giving updates on the Starship rocket program. The reasons for Starship are twofold, Musk says. First to push humanity to become a multiplanet species, and then to inspire the public. \"There must be also reasons to get up in the morning and be excited about the future,\" Musk said. \"And a future where we are a spacefaring civilization is infinitely more exciting than one where we are not doing it.\" SpaceX has delayed the start of its Starship Flight 10 launch webcast to no earlier than 7:13 p.m. EDT (2313 GMT), but has given the \"go\" to begin fueling the massive rocket for today's test flight. There is a 55% chance of good weather for the launch today, the company said. Counting down to Starship's tenth flight test. Weather is currently 55% favorable for launch at the start of the window → https://t.co/UIwbeGoVS9 pic.twitter.com/s4GiykTfdgAugust 25, 2025 SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is apparently on hand for tonight's planned Starship Filght 10 launch, sharing some up close views of the giant megarocket and its 33-engine first stage. \"Starship ready for launch,\" Musk wrote on X just before 2 p.m. EDT alongside a photo of the stacked Starship launch vehicle. Starship ready for launch pic.twitter.com/wVqq92wrRsAugust 25, 2025 A short time later, he shared a view of the business end of the Starship's Super Heavy booster. \"Standing under Starship,\" Musk wrote, with a view all the 33 Raptor rocket engines that power the booster's liftoff. Standing under Starship pic.twitter.com/KD9zrVnPJmAugust 25, 2025 SpaceX's Starship Flight 10 mission is progressing toward a planned 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT) launch. A livestream of the flight will begin at 6:55 p.m. EDT (2255 GMT). SpaceX's Starship Flight 10 is now officially rescheduled for Monday, Aug. 25, with launch set for 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT) from the company's Starship facility near Brownsville and Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. A launch livestream will begin at about 6:55 p.m. EDT (2255 GMT). The new launch date comes one day after SpaceX postponed a planned Sunday night launch for Starship Flight 10 due to an unspecified \"issue with ground systems,\" the company has said. SpaceX has at least one more backup day for the launch on Aug. 26, if needed. SpaceX has officially scrubbed the launch of today's Starship Flight 10 mission due to a problem with ground support systems. \"Standing down from today's tenth flight of Starship to allow time to troubleshoot an issue with ground systems,\" SpaceX wrote in a status update on X. The scrub decision came just after SpaceX had begun fueling the Starship Super Heavy booster and Ship upper stage with its liquid methane propellant. SpaceX does have at least two backup launch days on Aug. 25 and Aug. 26. SpaceX has reset its launch time to T-12 hours, suggesting a potential launch attempt sometime Monday, Aug. 25. SpaceX says its Starship launch team has begun filling the Flight 10 Super Heavy booster with its liquid methane propellant, and that the start of its livestream iwill begin at 7:15 pm ET (2315 GMT).\"Propellant load of the Super Heavy booster is underway. Live coverage starts in ~15 minutes,\" SpaceX wrote in an update at 7 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT). SpaceX reports that fueling is underway for its Starship Flight 10 mission. \"Propellant load of Starship's upper stage is now underway,\" SpaceX wrote in an update on X. That means SpaceX is fueling Starship's Ship upper stage with its liquid methane propellant for launch. Fueling of the entire Ship/Super Heavy stack will continue until close to launch. SpaceX's Starship launch team has been given the \"go\" to begin fueling the Starship Fight 10 Ship and Super Heavy for launch. Liftoff was slated for about 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT), though SpaceX has said there's a 55% chance of good weather at liftoff time. \"Starship 10 launching tonight,\" Elon Musk wrote on his social medial site X. SpaceX's launch webcast will begin at about 7:13 p.m. EDT (2313 GMT) today. Since the livestream was due to begin abotu 30 minutes before liftoff, that could indicate a slight delay in launch time. Launch day is here for SpaceX's Flight 10 Starship test flight, with liftoff still slated for no earlier than 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT). A live webcast will begin at 7 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT). You can watch SpaceX's Starship Flight 10 launch here on Space.com, courtesy of Space.com. On Saturday, SpaceX issued a noise alert for the upcoming launch, solidifying the date for a launch attempt. The company has a one-hour launch window for Fligth 10's liftoff today, with two potential backup days on Aug. 25 and Aug. 26. Space.com's live coverage will begin around 7 p.m. EDT with the start of SpaceX's live webcast. SpaceX is now one day away from the planned Aug. 24 launch of its Starship Flight 10 megarocket. We expect details on vehicle stacking today to set the stage for a planned 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT) launch on Sunday from SpaceX's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Beach in Florida. SpaceX has a one-hour launch window and two backup days for its Starship Flight 10 launch. The livestream should begin at about 7 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT) on Sunday. You can find out all the details, including full timelines for Flight 10 countdown and launch, in our newest story by Space.com Editor in Chief Tariq Malik:Full Story: What time is SpaceX's Starship Flight 10 launch on Aug. 24? SpaceX has moved the Super Heavy booster that will launch its next Starship test flight, Flight 10, to its launch pad at the company's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. The move sets the stage for the stacking of the massive Starship and Super Heavy launch vehicle, the world's largest and most powerful rocket, for its planned launch on Sunday, Aug. 24, at 7:30 p.m. EST (0030 GMT). This will be the 10th test flight for SpaceX's Starship launch system and the fourth such flight in 2025. All three of the prior launch tests this year failed to reach their main objective, with the Starship vehicle either exploding or breaking apart after a failure in flight. SpaceX says the 10th integrated test flight of its Super Heavy Starship launch vehicle could launch as soon as Aug. 24. Liftoff from the company's Starbase, Texas, manufacturing and test site is expected during a launch window that begins at 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT). SpaceX announced the launch date on X Friday (Aug. 15), about one week later than SpaceX CEO Elon Musk predicted in mid-July when he estimated Starship would launch again in \"about three weeks.\" Read more: SpaceX aims to launch Starship Flight 10 test flight on Aug. 24 SpaceX video from Starship Flight 9 showed burnthrough of some flaps as it falls uncontrolled from space. Contact has been lost after propellant leaks inside the vehicle led to a loss of attitude control.\"We are expecting it to break up essentially as it reenters over the Indian Ocean,\" SpaceX's Dan Huot says. With loss of contact, SpaceX has concluded its live commentary of the Starship Flight 9 test flight. The launch showed that SpaceX's Super Heavy booster can be reflown, though the booster did break apart during its final descent and landing burn over the Gulf of Mexico. The Ship vehicle, meanwhile, failed to test its satellite deployment mechanism when its payload door failed to open properly about 18 minutes into the flight. Later in the flight, Ship began to spin due to propellant leaks inside the vehicle, leading to a loss of attiude control. That loss of control prompted SpaceX to skip its engine relight test. The spacecraft then tumbled and began to break apart as it fell back to Earth over a target zone in the Indian Ocean. This will conclude our coverage of the Starship Flight 9 test launch. SpaceX's Starship Fight 9 Ship is spinjning out of control after propellant leaks led to the loss of control of the spacecraft, the company says. \"We have lost attitude control,\" Dan Huot says. Starship will skip its engine relight test, now. \"It is definitely coming down, it is definitely coming down over the Indian Ocean, but our changes of making it all the way down are slim,' Huot says. SpaceX's Starship vehicle has suffered what appears to be a propellant leak and is spinning in space, making it unlikely it will be able to successfully reenter Earth's atmospere, the company says. \"Not looking great with a lot of our on orbit objectives today,\" SpaceX's Dan Huot says. \"Nonetheless, Starship marching forward toward reentry over the Indian Ocean.\" Views from the vehicle show it to be tumbling in space, with telemetry showing the vehicle veering widely as it hurtles toward the Indian Ocean. SpaceX's Starship Flight 3 test flight saw a similar leak and tumble, Huot said. SpaceX reports that the payload door needed for today's Starlink satellite deployment demonstration did not fully open as expected. Flight controllers are working to close the door again and move on with the test flight.\"So it does look like we're not going to be able to deploy Starlinks today,\" SpaceX's Dan Huot says. SpaceX's Starlink satellite deployment system on Starship uses a slot-like door to eject the flat satellites out into space like cassettes or Pez candy. With SpaceX's Ship in space and on course for today's suborbital flights, the Starship vehicle will next attempt to eject four Starlink satellite demonstrators. It is expected to eject them out like a Pez candy dispensor. SpaceX's Starship Flight 9 Ship has successfully separated from its upper stage and appears to be performing well as it makes its way on an around the world trip to the Indian Ocean. Super Heavy was returning to Earth to make a hard landing in the Gulf of Mexico, when it appeared to fail during a landing burn test. SpaceX never planned to recover this booster, but did plan some stress tests during descent. LIFTOFF! With a miighty roar, SpaceX's Starship Flight 9 megarocket has launched off the pad, making a historic second flight for the Super Heavy booster. Starship Flight 9 launch countdown is back on. SpaceX has called a HOLD on today's Starship Flight 9 countdown at T-41 seconds to allow extra checks on one of the 33 Raptor engines on the Super Heavy first stage booster. The countdown then resumed very briefly, then paused again and returned to T-40 seconds. \"It looks like this time it was a ground side issue,\" SpaceX Dan Huot said. SpaceX has a 1-hour window that closes at 8:30 pm ET (0030 GMT) today. SpaceX is now 5 minutes away from the launch of its Starship Flight 9 launch and counting, with fueling operations nearly complete. No technical or weather concerns are being tracked. SpaceX has completed a flaps check on the Ship vehicle. SpaceX is about 20 minutes into the fueling of the massive Starship Super Heavy first stage booster for today's launch. The Super Heavy on this flight is making its second flight after launching on SpaceX's Flight 7 test flight in January. SpaceX is flying nearly all of the rocket's 33 engines on this launch, with only a few replacements. It took SpaceX 30 Falcon 9 flights to refly one booster. The company is hoping to do the same in just 9 flights with Super Heavy. Because it's a reflight for Super Heavy, the company will not try to return it to the launch site for a pad capture. Instead, it will make a \"hard splashdown\" in the Gulf of Mexico after returning to Earth. Starship’s flight trajectory for today’s test pic.twitter.com/JXQXRFg4hYMay 27, 2025 SpaceX has begun loading propellant into the giant Starship and Super Heavy rocket in preparations for today's Flight 9 launch at 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT). Methane propellant is flowing into the Starship upper stage now, SpaceX reports. SpaceX's livestream has begun with commentators Dan Huot and Jessie Anderson. SpaceX is counting down to the planned launch of its Starship Flight 9 test flight at 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT) tonight, but it sounds like the company has a slight buffer in case of some last minute issues. \"Counting down to Starship's ninth flight test. The 60-minute launch window opens at 6:30 p.m. CT, with live coverage starting ~30 minutes before liftoff,\" SpaceX wrote on X. Past launches have had shorter windows of 30 minutes in which to fly, while others have had slightly longer. But the update was another indication that all systems appear in order for tonight's launch attempt. We'll have to wait a but longer for the Elon Musk's bug update on SpaceX's plans for Mars exploration. After promoting plans for his SpaceX talk, scheduled for today at 12:55 p.m. EDT (1655 GMT), Musk announced that the Mars plan update was postponed to after the upcoming Starship Flight 9 launch, which is still targeted for 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT). The new target time for the Mars update talk, called \"The Road To Making LIfe Multiplanetary\" is now scheduled for 9 p.m. EDT (0100 GMT). SpaceX has stacked its massive megarocket ahead of its planned Starship Flight 9 test launch today, May 27. If all goes well, the rocket will launch into space from Starsbase near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas at 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT). You can watch it live on Space.com, courtesy of SpaceX. This will be the ninth test flight of SpaceX's Starship and follows two failed flights in January and March. Today's flight will mark the first attempt to refly a Super Heavy booster, and will land the first stage in the Gulf of Mexico due to the test. The Ship upper stage, meanwhile, will continue on a trajectory toward a soft landing and splashdown in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Australia. SpaceX hopes to test satellite deployment, new control fins and heat shield technology, as well as an engine relight process for future flights. At 12:55 p.m. EDT (1655 GMT) today, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk will give a presentation called \"The Road To Making Life Multiplanetary,\" which is expected to be an update on the company's Mars exploration plans using Starship. You can watch that live on Space.com as well. SpaceX has set the launch date target for its next Starship test launch. The Starship Flight 9 test mission will launch no earlier than Tuesday, May 27, at 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT) on a mission that aims to test new upgrades tot he Super Heavy and Starship vehicles. It will not orbit the Earth, but should reach orbital speed. The launch will reuse the Super Heavy booster that launched SpaceX's Flight 7 test flight, which failed to reach its destination in January, marking the first reuse of a Starship booster. The Ship upper stage will attempt to deploy mock Starlink satellites and make a soft landing in the Indian Ocean. SpaceX confirms the Starship Ship upper stage for Flight 8 has been lost after losing engines and attide control about 20 seconds before completing its ascent burn. An investigation will soon begin into the failure, which appears reminiscent of a similar failure that doomed SpaceX's Flight 7 Ship vehicle in January. \"Obviously a lot to go through, a lot to dig through and we're going to go right at it,\" SpaceX's Dan Huot said during live launch commentary. \"We have some more to learn about this vehicle.\" Our wrap story will be posted shortly. SpaceX successfully returned its Super Heavy booster to Earth with what appeared to be a flawless catch at its Mechazilla launch pad, but the company reports its Ship upper stage is out of control. Several of the Ship's six Raptor engines appeared to fail during ascent, sending the rocket into a spin with SpaceX ultimately losing contact with the ship as it fell from space. SpaceX's Starship Super Heavy booster has separated from its Ship upper stage and is returning to Earth. SpaceX is currently GO for a Booster capture attempt, despite seeing 2 Raptor engines out during launch. Ship is continuing its ascent. The Booster is returning to Earth after performing a boost back burn. SpaceX's Starship Flight 8 test flight lifts off! The giant rocket, the largest ever built, roared off SpaceX's pad at Starbase in South Texas on time at 6:30 p.m. EST (2330 GMT) atop its Super Heavy booster, poweredby 33 Raptor 2 engines. The towering rocket's next milestone will be hot-staging and stage separation, when SpaceX hopes to attempt a Booster catch and landing back at its Mechazilla launch pad. Range and weather are both very green for launch, SpaceX's Kate Tice says of today's Starship Flight 8 with just minutes to go until launch. \"Super-green, if you will,\" Tice says. SpaceX is now less than 8 minutes from the launch of its Starship Flight 8 and counting and all systems are GO for launch. Unlike SpaceX's Monday launch try, the weather is pristine, with clear visibility for miles, a stark contrast from the clouds seen Monday. No range or technical issues have arisen, again a departure as Monday's launch attempt saw booster and Ship issues. As fueling continues on SpaceX's Starship rocket, the company's Chris Gebhardt just outlined plans for the new Raptor 3 engine SpaceX has designed for future missions. SpaceX's current Starship Super Heavy uses 33 Raptor 2 engines, with six on the upper stage. The new Raptor 3 is a sleeker design that should help SpaceX shave 1 metric ton of mass off each engine, allowing more capability for future Starship flights. SpaceX has fueling the Starship Super Heavy booster and Ship upper stage with the super-cold liquid methane and liquid oxygen for today's planned launch of the Flight 8 test flight. \"The primary paylod for these flights is data,\" SpaceX's Dan Huot said as the company' livestream begins. Huot says weather is \"GO\" and there are no technical issues with Super Heavy or Ship for today's Starship launch. SpaceX's livestream for today's Starship Flight 8 launch has begun (although it is just playing music for now). You can watch the livestream in the window at the top of this page, but it is also available on SpaceX's X page, as well as SpaceX's Starship Flight 8 mission page. The weather is looking good for SpaceX's planned Starship Flight 8 test launch tonight. In a status update on social media, SpaceX said it is on track to attempt its planned Starship Flight 8 launch tonight from its Starbase facility near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. \"Counting down to Starship's eighth flight test. Weather looks favorable at the pad and the 60-minute launch window opens at 5:30 p.m. CT,\" the company wrote in a post today. That 1 hour launch window means the mission could launch anytime between 6:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. EST (2330-0030 GMT). SpaceX is once again poised to launch its Starship Flight 8 test flight today, March 6, with liftoff set for no earlier than 6:30 p.m. EST (2330 GMT). Today's launch window is the first of three potential \"alternative dates\" through March 8 for the mission after a delayed launch attempt on Monday, March 3. You can watch the Starship Flight 8 launch live on Space.com, courtesy of SpaceX, starting at about 5:50 p.m. EST (2250 GMT). SpaceX announced early today, March 5, that its planned Starship Flight 8 launch will now take place no earlier than Thursday, March 6. Liftoff is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. EST (2330 GMT) that same day. The new launch date is a 24-hour delay from what was already a delayed launch for Starship Flight 8. SpaceX scrubbed an attempted launch on Monday, March 3, due to last-minute issues on the megarocket's Booster and Ship stages. SpaceX is now targeting no earlier than Wednesday, March 5, for the launch of its Starship Flight 8 test flight. The earliest launch time is the same as before: 6:30 p.m. EST (2330 GMT). SpaceX attempted to launch Starship and its Super Heavy booster on Monday, March 3, but encountered issues on both Starship's Booster and Ship stages in the final minutes before liftoff. The company opted to stand down for the day in order to better understand the issues. That is apparently complete, with the company now confident it can attempt again to fly on Wednesday. As with Monday, SpaceX is expected to have a 30-minute window in which to launch the mission. Starship Flight 8 is the eighth test flight of SpaceX's Starship launch system. It will test a new version of the Ship vehicle, including a Starlink satellite deployment demonstration and other system tests and upgrades. The Super Heavy booster is expected to return to Earth and be captured by the metal \"chopstick\" arms of its Mechazilla launch pad structure. SpaceX has scrubbed today's launch attempt for the eighth test flight of its Starship megarocket. The countdown entered a hold at 40 seconds, which was momentarily lifted after some troubleshooting from SpaceX technicians. Seconds later, however, the rocket's onboard systems triggered an automatic scrub, canceling the launch for today. Another launch attempt will be possible tomorrow, March 3. Read our wrap story on the Starship Flight 8 scrub and see video. There is a hold on the count at T-minus 40 seconds for the eighth launch of SpaceX's Starship launch vehicle. According to SpaceX officials, technicians are troubleshooting an issue on the booster. Starship has the ability to hold following propellant loading, and SpaceX officials on the company's launch stream expect the count to continue toward launch shortly. T-10 minutes! SpaceX is poised to launch the eighth test flight of its Starship megarocket. Launch timeline as follows: Mission controllers in SpaceX's Starship control room have polled 'go' to proceed with loading propellant for Starship's eighth integrated flight test (IFT-8). An official launch time of 6:45 p.m. ET (2345 GMT, 5:45 p.m. CT local time at Starbase) is being targeted for liftoff. Watch the launch here and on Space.com, courtesy of SpaceX. A stream is also available on the SpaceX's IFT-8 mission website and their channel on X beginning at 5:59 p.m. ET (2259 GMT). SpaceX is as little as one hour away from the eighth launch of the company's Starship megarocket. Propellant line-cooling from the launchpad's cryogenic fuel tanks to the rocket has begun, with propellant loading expected to begin shortly. A 60-minute launch window for the mission opens at 6:30 p.m. ET (2330 GMT, 5:30 p.m. CT local time at Starbase). This is the eighth integrated flight test (IFT-8) for SpaceX's Super Heavy Starship stack. IFT-8 will include the attempted recover of the first-stage Super Heavy booster back at the Starbase's Pad-A, using the tower's \"chopstick\" arms. Starship's upper stage, Ship 34, will deploy four mass-simulation Starlink broadband satellites while on a suborbital trajectory, before a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean off Western Australia about 66 minutes after launch. You can watch it live here and on the Space.com homepage, courtesy of SpaceX, or directly on the company's website and on X. The stream will begin at 5:59 p.m. ET (2259 GMT). Today may be the day for SpaceX's Flight 8 Starship launch, as it's the first day of its window of flight opportunities. On Sunday, March 2, SpaceX moved the Starship Ship vehicle for the launch to its pad at the company's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. The massive Super Heavy booster was raised atop its Mechazilla launch pad late last week. If SpaceX does proceed with a launch today, Starship Flight 8 could lift off as early as 6:30 p.m. EST (2330 GMT), with a livestream beginning at about 5:50 p.m. EST (2250 GMT). You can watch it live here and find out the timing of the misson in our What time is SpaceX's Starship Flight 8 overview. SpaceX says it is now targeting no earlier than Monday, March 3, for the launch of its next Starship test mission Flight 8. The company announced the delay on the social media site X early Thursday, but did not give a reason for the delay. \"Now targeting to launch Starship's eighth flight test as soon as Monday, March 3,\" SpaceX said in the X post. Starship Flight 8 will test new upgrades to SpaceX's Ship vehicle and Super Heavy booster developed in the wake of the company's Flight 6 mission. The upgrades were originally added on SpaceX's Flight 7 launch, but the Ship vehicle suffered a propellant leak and internal fires, leading to its destruction before the test was completed. The Starship Flight 8 mission will attempt to test those pgrades, which includes the planned deployment of simulated satellites among other trials. SpaceX has rolled out the Super Heavy booster for its Starship Flight 8 launch. On Tuesday (Feb. 26), the company annouced its Flight 8 Booster was on the pad at the company's Starbase test site near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas ahead of a planned launch on Friday (Feb. 28). The Ship vehicle is expected to be stacked atop the booster soon ahead of the flight. SpaceX has test-fired the engines on both the Super Heavy and its Ship vehicle to set the stage for a Flight 8 Starship launch on Friday. SpaceX is targeting Friday, Feb. 28, to launch its next Starship megarocket test flight. Liftoff will be at 6:30 pm ET (2330 GMT). The Starship Flight 8 mission will launch a stacked Super Heavy booster and Ship vehicle on a trajectory similar to that of SpaceX's Flight 7 test flight last month. That Flight 7 test successfully returned its Super Heavy Booster to Earth with a \"chopsticks\" catch at its launch pad near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas, but the Ship vehicle was lost due to a propellant leak that sparked fires in an \"attic\" space above the engines on the rocket. During Flight 8, SpaceX will attempt to complete many of the objectives of the Flight 7 mission, including the deployment of simulated Starlink satellites, hardware tests for Ship reentry and landing, as well as new flap designs and other upgrades. SpaceX is already analyzing data from Starship's explosive seventh flight test. When it launched on Flight Test 7 on Jan. 16, 2024, Starship was able to successfully separate from its Super Heavy booster, which then landed on the company's launch tower at its Starbase facility in South Texas. However, SpaceX lost contact with Starship around eight minutes into the flight. The 'Ship' upper stage then exploded over the Atlantic Ocean. Posting on X, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk says the explosion was likely due to a propellant leak. \"Preliminary indication is that we had an oxygen/fuel leak in the cavity above the ship engine firewall that was large enough to build pressure in excess of the vent capacity,\" Musk said via X, adding that SpaceX is still aiming for another test flight next month.Read more: SpaceX Starship explosion likely caused by propellant leak, Elon Musk says Starship apparently didn't make it today. SpaceX was able to launch Starship and its Super Heavy booster today, and catch the booster successfully as it did on its fifth flight test. But Starship, the vehicle's upper stage, was lost just 8.5 minutes into the flight. It's unclear what happened, but SpaceX will be analyzing data in the days to come. SpaceX's Starship launched on its seventh flight test today. The massive stainless steel rocket lifted off at 5:37 p.m. ET (2237 GMT) from SpaceX's Starbase facility in South Texas. After successfully separating, Starship continued on to orbit, while its Super Heavy booster successfully landed on its launch tower, the second time SpaceX has caught a rocket. However, SpaceX has currently lost contact with Starship. Watch Flight Test 7 live here courtesy of SpaceX for more updates. SpaceX is ready to launch Starship on its seventh flight test.

You can watch the action live here at Space.com courtesy of SpaceX, or directly via the company. Coverage will begin about 35 minutes before launch. It's another big day in spaceflight today as SpaceX readies to launch Starship Flight 7. SpaceX's massive Starship rocket and Super Heavy booster will attempt to launch during a 60-minute window that opens at 5 p.m. EST (2200 GMT or 4 p.m. local time) on Wednesday, Jan. 15. Today's flight will feature a multitude of hardware changes SpaceX has made on the Starship upper stage based on data from the previous two flights, including moving the Starship's forward fins to make them more resistant to reentry heating, and making improvements to the vehicle's propulsion system. Starship will deploy 10 Starlink satellite simulators on today's flight while in orbit, which are similar in size and weight to the company's upcoming next-generation Starlink spacecraft. This will be the first time SpaceX has attempted to deploy payloads from Starship. If all goes according to plan, SpaceX will once again attempt to catch Starship's Super Heavy booster for landing with the \"chopsticks\" on its launch tower, a feat the company accomplished on Flight 5 in October 2024. You can watch the Starship Flight 7 launch live on Space.com today courtesy of SpaceX. The company's livestream should begin about 35 minutes before the launch window opens, around 4:25 p.m. EST (2130 GMT). Stay tuned for more updates as launch time approaches. SpaceX has postponed the launch of tis Starship Fligth 7 test flight to no earlier than Wednesday, Jan. 15, a two-day slip. Liftoff is still set for 5 p.m. EST (4 p.m. CT/2200 GMT) on launch day. SpaceX announced the launch date change late Saturday night, without details on the cause of the delay. \"Now targeting Wednesday, January 15 for the seventh flight test of Starship,\" SpaceX wrote on X. Jan. 15 is currently the last \"alternative day\" SpaceX has listed for road closures around its Starbase facility for the launch by Cameron County officials, but the company could potentially set additional backup days in the days ahead. A Notice To Airmen alert from the FAA related to Starship Flight 7 runs from Jan. 9 to Han. 17, suggesting the company could have at least two more days in its line up for a Flight 7 launch. Now targeting Wednesday, January 15 for the seventh flight test of Starship → https://t.co/QNCSPTdYW2 pic.twitter.com/xz8eNkfV0TJanuary 12, 2025 SpaceX has conducted a successful fueling and launch rehearsal for its upcoming Starship Flight 7 test flight, which is scheduled to lift off on Monday, Jan. 13, at 5 p.m. EST (2200 GMT). Here's our handy guide on what time SpaceX will launch Starship Flight 7. Late Friday (Jan. 10), the company reported on the launch rehearsal, which occurred the same day the company reported it had fully assembled the nearly 400-foot (122 meters) rocket for flight. \"Starship and Super Heavy loaded with nearly 11 million pounds of propellant in a launch rehearsal ahead of the seventh flight test,\" SpaceX wrote on X on Friday. Starship and Super Heavy loaded with nearly 11 million pounds of propellant in a launch rehearsal ahead of the seventh flight test pic.twitter.com/aSWDcEGAznJanuary 11, 2025 SpaceX has moved the Starship Ship vehicle it will use for its Starship Flight 7 out to its pad at the company's Starbase test site near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. The Ship vehicle will be attached to its Super Heavy booster for a planned launch on Monday, Jan. 13, at 5 p.m. EST (2200 GMT). You'll be able to watch SpaceX's Starship Flight 7 launch live online via SpaceX's Flight 7 mission page and X account. We'll also have it live on Space.com at launch time. Starship Flight 7 is SpaceX's first Starship launch of 2025 and the first flight of a new, upgraded version of the Starship spacecraft. The new design includes flaps that have been moved forward and reduced in size. It has 25% more propellant volume and upgrades to engine feed lines. The spacecraft also has a new generation of heat tiles, upgraded avionics - including a more powerful flight computer - and other enhancements designed to allow Starship to stay in space for longer periods. SpaceX's next Starship test flight is a step closer to launch. This week, SpaceX and the FAA announced a series of milestones that put billionaire Elon Musk's company on track for a new Starship launch. That mission, called Flight 7, will mark the seventh test flight of a Starship Ship vehicle and SUper Heavy booster. The FAA launch license for Flight 7 clears an essential hurdle for SpaceX's Starship Flight 7 test flight, while also including some leeway in the case of specific failure scenarios (such as a vehicle lost at sea) that do not include damage to ground-based structures or injuries. In the last week, SpaceX has also test-fired the Starship Flight 7 Ship, as well as its Super Heavy booster. The company also tested the Ship's ability to relight its Raptor engines in space. The Flight 7 Ship will be a new version of Starship designed to improve the overall performance of the spacecraft, SpaceX has said. The new design includes forward flaps that are both smaller and in a slightly different location to better protect them during reentry, company officials have said. It will also include more redundancy for reliability, and systems to operate longer in space. While SpaceX has not yet released a specific flight plan for Starship Flight 7, the FAA launch license for the mission includes a similar profile to Flight 5 and Flight 6. Those launches included plans to launch the Ship vehicle on a path that ended with a \"soft-landing\" in the Indian Ocean, while the Super Heavy booster aimed to return to the launch site to be caught in the giant metal \"chopsticks\" of its launch tower. SpaceX's Starship Flight 5 test in October successfully caught the Super Heavy booster in the \"chopsticks,\" but the company ultimately waived off a capture attempt on the Flight 6 mission, and performed a soft-landing in the Gulf of Mexico instead. Some media reports have suggested SpaceX could attempt a Starship Flight 7 launch in early January, perhaps around Jan. 11, but SpaceX has not yet issued a targeted launch date. SpaceX's Starship Flight 6 Ship vehicle made what appeared to be a smooth descent and splashdown in the Indian Ocean. Read our full recap of the Starship Flight 6 launch and landing with photos and video. The vehicle made a flawless landing burn, pitch over and soft-landing as cameras on a buoy looked on. Unlike SpaceX's Flight 5 test flight, the Ship did not appear to explode after splashdown, but merely tipped over on its side engulfed in flames. SpaceX warned the public not to approach any Starship debris in the ocean from Ship or the Super Heavy booster as a safety measure. This will wrap up our SpaceX Starship Flight 6 live updates. Thanks for joining us and we'll see you with SpaceX's Flight 7 test, which could occur soon. SpaceX's Starship Flight 6 vehicle is reentering the Earth's atmosphere and going through its peak heating phase as it returns to Earth. SpaceX is intentionally putting the vehicle through a harsher reentry profile and removed more than 20,000 heat tiles to test the heating environment and stress on the spacecraft. SpaceX's Starship Flight 6 vehicle has fired up one of its six main engines in an in-space relight test that appears to have gone well. The test was very brief, but was a critical demonstration for future in-space maneuvers by Starship vehicles. The Ship vehicle is on a reentry approach, with an orange plasma glow as it proceeds back to Earth. SpaceX's Starship Flight 6 Ship vehicle is currently in a 40-minute cruise mode as it flies around Earth following a successful launch from the company's Starbase facility.SpaceX will attempt a Raptor engine relight during this cruise phase as a test for future flights. The vehicle will then make a descent and soft splashdown in the Indian Ocean after undergoing a reentry heating and flight profile that will be more rigorous that SpaceX's Flight 5 test flight last month. SPLASHDOWN! SpaceX's Starship Flight 6 Super Heavy booster has splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico after SpaceX waived off its rocket catch attempt during landing. The company did not give a specific reason for aborting the launch pad catch of the rocket, but did say that many factors had to go right to proceed with the attempt. \"We tripped a commit criteria,\" SpaceX's Dan Huot said. Meanwhile, the Starship vehicle itself has reached its nominal altitude and is in a cruise phase for today's hourlong flight. SpaceX is NO GO for a Super Heavy booster catch, and is waiving off to an offshore soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. SpaceX's Starship and Super Heavy booster have successfully separated, with SpaceX GO for a booster catch at its launch pad. LIFTOFF! SpaceX's Starship Flight 6 has lifted off from SpaceX's Starbase pad near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas in an on time launch at 5 pm ET. The Starship and its Super Heavy booster ignited 33 Raptor engines on its first stage to begin the climb to space. This is SpaceX's 6th Starship test flight. If all goes well, the Super Heavy may return to its launch site for a mechanical arm capture and landing, with the Starship headed on an hourlong trip to landing and splashdown in the Indian Ocean. SpaceX's Starship Flight 6 spacecraft and Suepr Heavy booster are just minutes away from launch as fueling concludes. Weather looks very good for flight, with no technical issues. \"The fun part is about to start,\" SpaceX's Dan Huot saidLiftoff is MINUTES AWAY from launch at 5 pm ET. SpaceX has revealed its first payload to fly on a Starship rocket: a stuffed banana. The company is launching a plush banana suspended by wires inside the giant Starship vehicle and is promising live views of the banana throughout the flight if all goes well. SpaceX placed an emblem of a pixelated banana holding a banana on the nose of the Starship vehicle to mark this flight. The company is also selling the banana plush toy for $30 on its website, as well as the banana emblem as wall decal for $75.Meanwhile, on Starship: \"Starship and Super Heavy’s 39 Raptor engines are chilling down in preparation for liftoff,\" the company says. Fueling is in fuel swing for SpaceX's Starship Flight 6 test flight. \"We're loading right up to the last possible minute,\" SpaceX spokesman Dan Huot said in a live commentary. \"Weather is fantastic, light breeze, no clouds in the sky, not tracking any hardware constraints to launch today, if we're not able to get off the path, though, we've got opportunities throughout the week.\" SpaceX says its Starship Flight 6 spacecraft and Super Heavy booster are \"go\" for fueling. \"The Starship team is go for prop load,\" SpaceX wrote in an update. The company is expected to start its live launch webcast soon. Starship is fueled by 10 million pounds of super-cold liquid methane and liquid oxygen propellant to feed its 33 Raptor engines on the Super Heavy and six vacuum Raptor engines on the Starship upper stage. SpaceX is just hours away from its Starship Flight 6 launch and the company will have a special guest on scene to watch the launch. \"I’m heading to the Great State of Texas to watch the launch of the largest object ever to be elevated, not only to Space, but simply by lifting off the ground,\" Trump wrote on X (formerly Twitter). \"Good luck to @ElonMusk and the Great Patriots involved in this incredible project!\" Trump repeatedly referred to SpaceX's successful Starship Flight 5 launch, which included the first catch of a Super Heavy booster, during the final days of his presidential campaign as well as during his victory speech after winning the U.S. election. I’m heading to the Great State of Texas to watch the launch of the largest object ever to be elevated, not only to Space, but simply by lifting off the ground. Good luck to @ElonMusk and the Great Patriots involved in this incredible project! https://t.co/UVpVSkpEyuNovember 19, 2024 It is launch day for SpaceX's Starship Flight 6 and the company appears on track for today's planned rocket launch and Super Heavy booster catch from Starbase near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. Liftoff is targeted for 5 p.m. EST (2200 GMT), with a livestream to begin at 4:30 p.m. EST (2130 GMT). \"All systems and weather are looking good for today's flight test of Starship,\" SpaceX wrote in an update on X (formerly Twitter). You'll be able to watch the SpaceX Starship Flight 6 launch webcast live on Space.com at start time. All systems and weather are looking good for today's flight test of Starship.The live launch webcast on @X will go live ~40 minutes before liftoff, which is targeted for 4:00 p.m. CT → https://t.co/1xyLhQKE2N pic.twitter.com/lqy2CsL4vzNovember 19, 2024 SpaceX has fueled the its massive Starship rocket and Super Heavy booster in a test for the company's Flight 6 test flight ahead of a planned launch on Tuesday, Nov. 19. The towering Starship and Super Heavy passed a so-called \"wet-dress rehearsal\" on Sunday, Nov. 17, as SpaceX prepares for the Flight 6 launch. The fueling test was one of the final checks ahead of the test flight, which will mark SpaceX's sixth Starship launch overall. Like SpaceX's Flight 5 launch on Oct. 13, Flight 6 aims to launch a Starship rocket atop a Super Heavy booster, return the booster to Earth to be captured by metal \"chopsticks\" at the launch pad, and then soft-land the Starship in the Indian Ocean. While the flight profile of Flight 6 is similar to that of Flight 5, there are key differences. Check out our What to Expect for Starship Flight 6 overview for more. SpaceX is currently targeting Tuesday, Nov. 19, at 5 p.m. EST (2200 GMT) to launch Starship Flight 6, with a livestream beginning at 4:30 p.m. EST (2130 GMT). You'll be able to watch the Starship Flight 6 live online, including on Space.com, at that time. SpaceX is now targeting Tuesday, Nov. 19, to launch its sixth Starship test flight from the company's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. The Starship and Super Heavy booster were stacked for flight on Friday, Nov. 15, in advance of the launch. SpaceX was initially targeting a launch date of no earlier than Nov. 18, with potential backup dates on Nov. 19 and Nov. 20. The company is now targeting no earlier than Nov. 19 at 5 p.m. EST (2200 GMT) for the launch, with at least one backup day on Nov. 20, based on road closure alerts from the Texas's Cameron County officials. SpaceX is now targeting Nov. 18 for its next Starship launch, which will loft the sixth test flight of the world's largest rocket. Flight 6 of SpaceX's Starship and Super Heavy booster is scheduled to lift off no earlier than Monday, Nov. 18, from the company's Starbase test site near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. Liftoff is set for 4 p.m. EST (2100 GMT) during a 30-minute launch window. As with SpaceX's successful Flight 5 on Oct. 13, Flight 6 will attempt to capture the Starship Super Heavy booster at its landing site using giant metal \"chopsticks.\" The Ship vehicle, meanwhile, will attempt a \"soft landing\" in the Indian Ocean before splashing down and sinking. SpaceX's Starship Flight 5 vehicle successfully made a \"soft-landing\" in the Indian Ocean, showing live all the way down. After its landing burn, the Starship vehicle tipped over on its side to fall into the ocean, then appeared to explode to end its mission. Read our full wrap story and see photos and video. \"I think it's safe to say, we have a Ship in the water,\" SpaceX's Kate Tice said. SpaceX showed live video of the splashdown aftermath from a buoy that was waiting at the splashdown site. And that is a wrap for today's SpaceX Flight 5 Starship launch. At the time of its ending, about 4 million people were watching SpaceX's livestream. We will update our wrap story with the successful splashdown shortly and thanks for joining us! The Starship Flight 5 vehicle is subsonic and nearing its landing flip for an attempted soft-landing in the Indian Ocean. SpaceX's Starship Flight 5 vehicle has passed through the peak heating phase of today's reentry and appears to be on track for its upcoming landing flip and burn. There does appear to be some burn through on one of the four flaps on the spacecraft in live views. SpaceX's Starship vehicle has begun its reentry into Earth's atmosphere, with a red glow of super hot plasma visible in live views from the spacecraft delivered by SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet constellation. It should take about 10 minutes for Starship to complete reentry. SpaceX's Starship vehicle is in a 1-hour coast phase as it makes its away to the other side of the world for a reentry over the Indian Ocean, west of Australia. A jubilant SpaceX is still reeling from the successful capture of its Super Heavy rocket on the first try. Drone video is showing spectacular views of the towering booster hanging from its Mechazilla launch pad arms after the capture. Space.com's initial launch story will be posted shortly. SpaceX just made history with the successful capture of its Super Heavy rocket during an audacious first landing attempt of the most powerful rocket on Earth. SpaceX's Starship Super Heavy rocket is headed back to its launch site for today's historic landing attempt. SpaceX has live views of the booster on its way back to Earth. \"We are go for catch,\" Kate Tice says, The Starship Flight 5 Super Heavy booster has separated from its Starship vehicle and successfully completed its boostback burn. SpaceX's launch tower is GO for catch attempt for landing! LIftoff! SpaceX's fifth Starship and Super Heavy test flight has cleared the pad at 8:25 a.m. EDT (1225 GMT). The launch is proceeding. At the T-5 minute mark, SpaceX continues to work to clear boats from the offshore launch range. Spokesman Dan Hout says SpaceX may hold the launch for up to 5 minutes, the rest of its window, in order to get those ships clear. Aside from that, no issues for launch. SpaceX is now 10 minutes away and counting to the launch of its Starship Flight 5 mission. There are about 1 million people watching the company's livestream on X and nearly 20K on Space.com's VideoFromSpace stream. SpaceX reports that the 39 engines on the Starship/Super Heavy rocket (33 on Super Heavy and six on Starship) are in a chilldown phase in preparation for today's launch. SpaceX spokesperson Dan Hout reports no technical issues for today's launch. SpaceX is working to clear the launch range offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, but expected to be clear at launch time. \"As of right now, we're just under 14 minutes to liftoff and not working any issues,\" Hout says. SpaceX says Starship Flight 5 will use new heat shield tiles the company has designed to be stronger and perform better than those used on the Starship Flight 4 vehicle. The company has also made upgrades to the launch tower and catching mechanism for today's flight. Starship will also carry some special aluminum heat shield tiles to collect more information on the heating environment during reentry on the vehicle. SpaceX's Starship Flight 5 livestream has begun! You can follow it live on Space.com's homepage, on this page and at our YouTube channel. SpaceX has now begun fueling the Starship Super Heavy booster for today's launch. The company's webcast has not yet begun on X. Today's launch, originally scheduled for 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT), was pushed back to 8:25 a.m. EDT (1225 GMT). The company's initial 30-minute launch window for today's flight will close at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT), if SpaceX sticks to it. SpaceX has begun fueling the Starship upper stage with the liquid methane and liquid oxygen propellant to power its six Raptor engines. Fueling of the Super Heavy first stage for its 33 Raptor rocket engines is expected to begin shortly. SpaceX reports all systems are \"go\" to begin fueling the Starship rocketship and its Super Heavy booster for today's planned Flight 5 test flight but it seems like there's a new 8:25 a.m. ET (1225GMT) launch time from the company's Starbase site near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. \"The Starship team is go for prop load, and weather is looking ideal for today's flight test!\" SpaceX wrote in an X update. \"The launch webcast will go live ~35 minutes ahead of liftoff which is currently targeted for 7:25am CT.\" A launch time at 7:25 a.m. CT (8:25 a.m. EDT) would set a 7:45 a.m. EDT webcast start time 35 minutes earlier. SpaceX remains go for today's planned Starship Flight 5 launch test and you'll be able to watch it all live on Space.com. SpaceX's webcast will begin at about 7:35 a.m. EDT (1135 GMT) with a targeted launch time of 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT). SpaceX has a 30-minute launch window for today's test flight, and may have backup opportunities on Monday and Tuesday. The primary webcast will be livestreamed on SpaceX's X page, but you can also watch it on YouTube at Space.com's VideoFromSpace channel. \"Currently still go for launch,\" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk wrote on X a few hours ago. I'm Tariq Malik, Editor-in-Chief of Space.com, and will have live commentary here as events warrant for the mission. Today's flight test should last about 65 minutes, with much of the action occurring up front as SpaceX hopes to attempt the first landing and capture of its Super Heavy booster at its Mechazilla launch pad. That should occur in the first 8 minutes. At the 65-minute mark, the Starship vehicle is expected to reentry over the Indian Ocean, west of Australia, and could include live views from the spacecraft as on Flight 4 in June. SpaceX's Flight 5 Starship and Super Heavy rocket are fully stacked and one day away from launch, and CEO Elon Musk says the company is excited to attempt is first-ever booster catch. \"Looks like Starship might fly on Sunday! This the largest & most powerful flying object ever made at more than double the thrust of the Saturn V Moon rocket,\" Musk wrote on X late Friday. \"We will try to catch it upon return to launch site using the Mechazilla arms like giant chopsticks (like Karate Kid)! Looks like Starship might fly on Sunday!This the largest & most powerful flying object ever made at more than double the thrust of the Saturn V Moon rocket. We will try to catch it upon return to launch site using the Mechazilla arms like giant chopsticks (like Karate Kid)! https://t.co/8g7mLaTCRKOctober 11, 2024 While SpaceX hopes to try and catch the Super Heavy booster, the company may opt to \"soft-land\" it in the Gulf of Mexico if anything looks off for the flight. \"SpaceX engineers have spent years preparing and months testing for the booster catch attempt, with technicians pouring tens of thousands of hours into building the infrastructure to maximize our chances for success. We accept no compromises when it comes to ensuring the safety of the public and our team, and the return will only be attempted if conditions are right,\" SpaceX wrote in a mission overview. \"Thousands of distinct vehicle and pad criteria must be met prior to a return and catch attempt of the Super Heavy booster, which will require healthy systems on the booster and tower and a manual command from the mission’s Flight Director,\" SpaceX added. \"If this command is not sent prior to the completion of the boostback burn, or if automated health checks show unacceptable conditions with Super Heavy or the tower, the booster will default to a trajectory that takes it to a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.\" SpaceX and Cameron County officials have issued a sonic boom warning to the residents living in the general area around the company's Starbase facility so they can expect the loud booms of the Super Heavy's return. SpaceX is officially \"GO\" to launch the Starship Flight 5 test flight for its new megarocket after receiving a launch license from the Federal Aviation Administration. The launch is set for Sunday, Oct. 13, at 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT). \"The FAA has issued a license modification authorizing SpaceX to launch multiple missions of the Starship/Super Heavy vehicle on the Flight 5 mission profile,\" FAA officials wrote in a statement today (Oct. 12). \"The FAA determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental and other licensing requirements for the suborbital test flight.\" For this test flight, SpaceX will launch the Starship and Super Heavy booster, which together are the world's largest and most powerful rocket, and attempt to return the booster to its launch pad at the company's Starbase facility and capture it with a the giant arms of its \"Mechazilla\" pad structure. The Starship rocket, meanwhile, will fly on a path that will take it over the Indian Ocean, where SpaceX hopes to perform a smooth reentry and \"soft landing\" in the ocean. SpaceX on Friday, Oct. 11, said its next Starship rocket could launch as early as Sunday, Oct. 13, pending final FAA regulatory approvals. Liftoff is targeted for no earlier than 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT) on Oct. 13, if the approvals come through in time. A livestream of the launch will be available on this page at launch time. The upcoming test flight, called Starship Flight 5, will liftoff off from SpaceX's Starbase testing site near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas - the same site for four previous Starship launch tests. This flight aims to build on SpaceX's Starship Flight 4 success on June 6, which marked the first Starship to reach space and a smooth \"soft\" splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico for the rocket's massive Super Heavy booster. For Flight 5, SpaceX hopes to recreate the success of the Starship vehicle's trajectory to target splashdown site in the Indian Ocean. But in a first, SpaceX will also attempt to return the rocket's massive Super Heavy booster, which is powered by 33 Raptor engines, back to its launch pad. There, SpaceX will attempt to catch the booster in the \"chopsticks\" of its massive Mechazilla launch pad structure. The system is designed to eventually allow quick turnarounds for Starship Super Heavy boosters for flights. \"Starship stacked ahead of its fifth flight test,\" SpaceX wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday afternoon (Oct. 11). \"We expect regulatory approval in time to fly on October 13.\" Starship stacked ahead of its fifth flight test. We expect regulatory approval in time to fly on October 13 pic.twitter.com/HCN4dcm1hZOctober 11, 2024 SpaceX and its CEO Elon Musk have said repeatedly that they have been ready to launch Starship Flight 5 since August, but have been held up by FAA reviews and proposed fines related to environmental concerns over the rocket's water deluge system.Last month, the FAA said it would likely take until November to issue a license for the Starship Flight 5 launch due to additional reviews related to the water deluge system, which FAA officials have required consultation with other regulatory agencies. Meanwhile, SpaceX is also facing potential fines from the FAA amounting to $633,000 related to Falcon 9 rocket launches. SpaceX has bristled at both the Flight 5 Starship delays and the potential fines, threatening to sue the FAA on the latter issue. Starship Die Cast Rocket Model Now $47.99 on Amazon. If you can't see SpaceX's Starship in person, you can score a model of your own. Standing at 13.77 inches (35 cm), this is a 1:375 ratio of SpaceX's Starship as a desktop model. The materials here are alloy steel and it weighs just 225g. \"We find ourselves delayed for unreasonable and exasperating reasons,\" SpaceX wrote in a blog post on Sept. 10. \"Unfortunately, we continue to be stuck in a reality where it takes longer to do the government paperwork to license a rocket launch than it does to design and build the actual hardware. This should never happen and directly threatens America's position as the leader in space.\" When fully assembled, SpaceX's Starship and Super Heavy booster stand about 400 feet (122 m) tall, making it the world's tallest and most powerful rocket. Both the Starship and its Super Heavy booster are designed to be reusable, though the Flight 5 mission does not plan to recover the Starship vehicle. NASA has picked SpaceX's Starship as the lunar lander for its Artemis 3 mission, which aims to send up to four astronauts to the moon for a crewed landing sometime in 2026. SpaceX has also sold at least one flight Starship to American billionaire Jared Isaacman, with reservations for another Starship trip around the moon. One Starship circumlunar flight reserved by Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa was canceled earlier this year. We will post updates on Starship Flight 5 and subsequent test flights and missions here as events warrant.",

    "content": "Hulu's shamelessly adult animated sci-fi series Solar Opposites has certainly pushed acceptable boundaries and fans’ funny bones over the past five seasons with its tale of a bizarre family of extraterrestrial refugees escaping the destruction of their planet, Schlorp, and crash landing on Earth in a generic suburban neighborhood. Now, Korvo, Terry, Jessie, Yumyulack, and the Pupa will make one final appearance in the sixth and final season, premiering all ten episodes on Oct. 13, 2025. 20th Television Animation's \"Solar Opposites\" is delivered by executive producers Mike McMahan (\"Rick and Morty,\" \"Star Trek: Lower Decks\"), Josh Bycel (“American Dad”), and Sydney Ryan (\"Rick and Morty\"). We had the chance to chat with the first two-thirds of the creative trio about this wild final outing. \"Finales are hard, especially in comedy and especially when you don't want them to happen,\" McMahan tells Space.com regarding the show's semi-sad ending. \"We would keep making 'Solar Opposites' until we were dust in the ground. We have this big, long arc of the story in The Wall, of these little people stuck in this wall terrarium. We really wanted to do something that felt like both the end of an era, but also a preview of what could keep happening. \"So there's really cool stuff that ends in The Wall, and there's also some really cool stories that are offered. We finally bring the SilverCops story to an end in a satisfying way. And we also bring Terry and Korvo and all of the Schlorpians' story to a resolution in a way that I don't even know people were expecting. We really made an effort to close the book on that, too, even for characters that didn't seem like they were in a big dramatic storyline.\" As the unhinged comedy comes to a conclusion, Bycel loves that they took the Solars in a different direction for Season 6 by getting rid of their \"funds\" to reveal a wealth of latent talents. \"They started as these all-knowing, all-seeing, all-powerful aliens who had unlimited resources, and over the years we’ve made them more human,\" Bycel notes. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! \"Now all of a sudden, this year they have no money and they have to go out and get jobs and change who they are, and I love that evolution. I love the fact that if it wasn't for the diamond machine getting destroyed, we'd never have found out that Terry is an amazing romantasy novelist. Or that Yumyulack and Jessie are actually smart. Or that Korvo could break out of his mold of just wanting the mission to succeed, to realize that he's a great dad and a great husband, and that he actually would be very good at bossing around other people. That one little thing of getting rid of their money allowed us to unlock so much more.\" Adult animation has come into its own over the past decade, and \"Solar Opposites\" deserves a slot in the conversation of influential shows that will stand the test of time. \"It's funny, whenever I talk to other people that work on adult animated shows, they're always big fans of 'Solar,' because we do crazy stuff, we take big experimental swings,\" McMahan notes. \"In hanging out with 'The Simpsons'' legend Matt Selman, he's like, 'Man, you guys get to do stuff that's so different than what we get to do.' If 'Solar' has a legacy, it's going to be as a sister show to 'Rick and Morty,' I mean, that was the big gorilla, a show that moved the bottom line for an entire corporation. Then our show shows up and we're dropping all the episodes at once, we're about a queer-coded couple, and it's more joyous and sillier than 'Rick and Morty.' \"It's why I think 'American Dad' did so great,\" continues McMahan, noting that the show carved out \"its own identity as this funny, interesting thing\" that doesn't have to compete with the shows that spawned it. \"If you binge 'Solar' all at once, it's a really special thing that we might not ever get again. It was a streaming era show that is both equal parts standalone comedy and heavily thought-out and serialized. There's a million reasons you don't do something like that. It feels really special and unique, and that's what stands out.\" Bycel had worked on \"American Dad\" and many other iconic animated shows, but to him, this one project felt from the very beginning like they could almost get away with anything. \"Hulu was so supportive, and because we were the little bastard stepchild to 'Rick and Morty,' there weren't as many eyes on us in the beginning,\" explains Bycel. \"I think it made us want to experiment as much as we could. Mike and I first bonded over our love of TV and movies, and being latchkey kids raised by afternoon TV. That's something that was in every episode. There's so much joy in these characters, even when they were fighting, even when killing each other, there was so much joy, because they were so much fun to write.\" \"Solar Opposites\" Season 6 streams exclusively on Hulu (US) or Disney+ (UK) starting today, along with the previous five seasons.

    "content": "This article was originally published at The Conversation. The publication contributed the article to Space.com's Expert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights. Buried deep in Greenland's ice sheet lies a puzzling chemical signature that has sparked intense scientific debate. A sharp spike in platinum concentrations, discovered in an ice core (a cylinder of ice drilled out of ice sheets and glaciers) and dated to around 12,800 years ago, has provided support for a hypothesis that the Earth was struck by an exotic meteorite or comet at that time. Our new research offers a much more mundane explanation: this mystery platinum signature may have originated from a volcanic fissure eruption in Iceland, not space. The timing matters. The platinum spike occurs near the beginning of our planet's last great cold period, the Younger Dryas Event. This lasted from about 12,870 to 11,700 years ago and saw temperatures plummet across the northern hemisphere. This happened just as the planet had actually been warming up from the last ice age. Understanding what triggered this cold snap could help us understand how Earth's climate may change in the future. We propose that this icy phase in Earth's climatic history was in fact caused either by a large volcanic eruption in Germany or by the eruption of an unknown volcano. Ice cores show that during the millennium-long Younger Dryas Event, temperatures across Greenland dropped to more than 15°C colder than they are today. Europe returned to near glacial conditions, with tundra replacing forests that had begun to flourish. Low-latitude rainbelts shifted to the south. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! The traditionally accepted explanation involves a massive release of freshwater from melting North American ice sheets. This freshwater pulse disrupted the ocean circulation, affecting temperatures. However, other researchers have proposed that the event was triggered by a comet or asteroid impact over North America. In 2013, researchers analyzing ice cores drilled as part of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP2) discovered platinum concentrations that were well above normal levels. The ratio of platinum to a radioactive element called iridium was also unusual because space rocks usually have high levels of iridium, while the ice core spike does not. The ice core signature was very different from anything seen in known meteorites or volcanic rocks. The authors of the space impact paper suggested that perhaps the unusual ice chemistry reflected the impact of an unusual asteroid made up of iron. A subsequent paper proposed that the ice chemistry could reflect the German Laacher See volcanic eruption, which had an unusual geochemistry and occurred around that time. To test this idea, we collected and analyzed 17 samples of volcanic pumice from deposits left behind by the Laacher See eruption. We measured platinum, iridium, and other trace elements to create a chemical fingerprint of the eruption. Our results were clear: the Laacher See pumices contain virtually no platinum, with concentrations below or barely at detection limits. Even though some platinum may have escaped to the atmosphere before being trapped in the rock, the eruption was clearly not the source of Greenland's platinum spike. Additionally, when we examined the timing carefully, using updated ice core chronologies, we found the platinum spike actually occurred about 45 years after the Younger Dryas began – too late to have triggered the cooling. This result was arrived at independently but was consistent with previous research finding the same thing. Importantly, the elevated platinum concentrations lasted for 14 years, suggesting a prolonged event rather than an instantaneous asteroid or comet impact. We compared the ice core's chemical signature with various other geological samples and found the closest match was with volcanic gas condensates (the products formed when gases released from a volcano cool from a gas to a liquid or solid state) particularly from submarine volcanoes. Iceland's volcanoes can produce fissure eruptions lasting years or even decades, matching the 14-year duration of the platinum spike. During the melting phase that preceded the Younger Dryas, Iceland's volcanic activity increased dramatically as melting ice sheets reduced pressure on the Earth’s crust. Crucially, submarine or subglacial eruptions interact with water in ways that could explain the unusual chemistry. Seawater can strip away sulphur compounds while concentrating other elements like platinum in volcanic gases. These platinum-rich gases could then travel to Greenland and be deposited on the ice sheet, explaining the odd geochemistry. Recent research on historical Icelandic eruptions supports this mechanism. The 8th-century Katla eruption produced a 12-year spike in heavy metals like bismuth and thallium in Greenland ice cores. The 10th-century Eldgjá eruption resulted in a cadmium spike within glacial ice. Although platinum was not measured in those studies, these examples show Icelandic volcanoes regularly deliver heavy metals to the Greenland ice sheet. Because of the chronological mismatch, whatever mechanism was responsible for the platinum spike didn't trigger the Younger Dryas. Our research does, however, highlight previous results showing a massive volcanic sulphate spike in multiple ice cores coinciding precisely with the onset of cooling 12,870 years ago. This eruption, whether from the Laacher See eruption or an unknown volcano, injected enough sulphur into the atmosphere to rival the largest eruptions in recorded history. Volcanic eruptions can trigger cooling by releasing sulphur into the stratosphere, reflecting incoming sunlight and potentially setting off a cascade of positive feedbacks including sea ice expansion, changed wind patterns and disruption of ocean currents, though future research needs to explore this further. The substantial volcanic forcing around the Younger Dryas onset – a time when climate was already sitting between a glacial and an interglacial (the periods between cold snaps) – may have provided the nudge that tipped Earth’s climate back into a cold state. — Satellites reveal a hidden lake burst through Greenland Ice Sheet in 2014, causing major flooding and a deep crater — Greenland ice sheets are weaker to climate change than we thought — What is the US Space Force doing in Greenland? It is important to note that our research focused on the platinum spike and did not consider other evidence, such as spherules (spherical fragments of melted rock) and black mats (mysterious dark layers in soil), for an extraterrestrial impact. That said, based on our analysis of the new results and existing data, a large northern hemispheric volcanic eruption seems to be the most straightforward explanation for the Younger Dryas Event. Understanding past climate triggers is vital for anticipating what lies ahead. Although the chance of a large meteorite impact or volcanic eruption in any given year is low, such events are virtually certain to occur eventually. Knowing how Earth’s climate responded in the past is therefore crucial for preparing for the consequences of the next major event.

    "content": "Little is known about super-secretive EV startup Slate, but the fledgling brand is rumored to be backed by Jeff Bezos and determined to shake up the existing electric order with an affordable lineup of compact SUVs and pickups with that golden $25,000 price tag. Now, at least, we know what it’s gonna look like. The battle of the billionaires is on! Redditor jonjopop over at the spotted subreddit spotted what looks like an early prototype of an unbranded SUV with bizarre “CryShare” wrap. CryShare, as a concept, seems to combine the functionality of a ride sharing app like Uber or Lyft with the familiar (to parent, anyway) idea that small babies will often sleep better in a moving car than in their own cribs … but that’s not what’s important here. Instead, focus on the vehicle itself – parked on Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Los Angeles without explanation or fanfare, this is our best look yet at the kind of vehicle(s) Slate is likely to reveal in the coming days. Other local automotive journalists caught wind of the public unveiling, too – and our friends at The Autopian (Hi, Matt!) sent their own David Tracy out on the streets of LA to check it out. Tracy took the following video and posted it to Instagram. A post shared by The Autopian (@theautopian) The Slate breaking cover and causing buzz just ahead of what’s sure to be a painful Q1 earnings call for Tesla is a masterstroke of marketing – especially as doubts surrounding the viability of a “less expensive” Tesla Model Y or Model 3 continue to mount amid the uncertainty of Trump’s tariffs and declining sales of the brand’s more profitable models both at home and abroad. How does it feel dancing like a puppet to the whims and moods of these laughably wealthy, wildly undertaxed oligarchs? These robber barons might be in a good mood one day and give you an affordable EV. But, the mood will turn and they'll end up laughing on stage swinging a chainsaw while cutting tens of thousands of worker's jobs. Good times! As with so much involving Slate, however, there is nothing here written in stone – or even cast in cheese. Nothing has been announced, nothing is promised, and for all we know this might have more to do with the affordable Rivian brand launch, a new BYD, or be a viral marketing bit from some local Art Center design student in (relatively) nearby Pasadena. In fact, about the only thing I think we can say about Bezos (?) new Slate project with confidence today is this: Elon could probably use that drink. SOURCES | IMAGES: Reddit, The Autopian.

    "content": "Earlier this year, a developer was shocked by a message that appeared on his personal phone: “Apple detected a targeted mercenary spyware attack against your iPhone.” “I was panicking,” Jay Gibson, who asked that we don’t use his real name over fears of retaliation, told TechCrunch. Gibson, who until recently built surveillance technologies for Western government hacking tools maker Trenchant, may be the first documented case of someone who builds exploits and spyware being themselves targeted with spyware. “What the hell is going on? I really didn’t know what to think of it,” said Gibson, adding that he turned off his phone and put it away on that day, March 5. “I went immediately to buy a new phone. I called my dad. It was a mess. It was a huge mess.” At Trenchant, Gibson worked on developing iOS zero-days, meaning finding vulnerabilities and developing tools capable of exploiting them that are not known to the vendor who makes the affected hardware or software, such as Apple. “I have mixed feelings of how pathetic this is, and then extreme fear because once things hit this level, you never know what’s going to happen,” he told TechCrunch. But the ex-Trenchant employee may not be the only exploit developer targeted with spyware. According to three sources who have direct knowledge of these cases, there have been other spyware and exploit developers in the last few months who have received notifications from Apple alerting them that they were targeted with spyware. Apple did not respond to a request for comment from TechCrunch. Contact Us Do you have more information about the alleged leak of Trenchant hacking tools? Or about this developer’s story? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or by email. The targeting of Gibson’s iPhone shows that the proliferation of zero-days and spyware is starting to ensnare more types of victims. Spyware and zero-day makers have historically claimed their tools are only deployed by vetted government customers against criminals and terrorists. But for the past decade, researchers at the University of Toronto’s digital rights group Citizen Lab, Amnesty International, and other organizations have found dozens of cases where governments used these tools to target dissidents, journalists, human rights defenders, and political rivals all over the world. The closest public cases of security researchers being targeted by hackers happened in 2021 and 2023, when North Korean government hackers were caught targeting security researchers working in vulnerability research and development. Two days after receiving the Apple threat notification, Gibson contacted a forensic expert who has extensive experience investigating spyware attacks. After performing an initial analysis of Gibson’s phone, the expert did not find any signs of infection, but still recommended a deeper forensic analysis of the exploit developer’s phone. A forensic analysis would have entailed sending the expert a complete backup of the device, something Gibson said he was not comfortable with. “Recent cases are getting tougher forensically, and some we find nothing on. It may also be that the attack was not actually fully sent after the initial stages, we don’t know,” the expert told TechCrunch. Without a full forensic analysis of Gibson’s phone, ideally one where investigators found traces of the spyware and who made it, it’s impossible to know why he was targeted or who targeted him. But Gibson told TechCrunch that he believes the threat notification he received from Apple is connected to the circumstances of his departure from Trenchant, where he claims the company designated him as a scapegoat for a damaging leak of internal tools. Apple sends out threat notifications specifically for when it has evidence that a person was targeted by a mercenary spyware attack. This kind of surveillance technology is often invisibly and remotely planted on someone’s phone without their knowledge by exploiting vulnerabilities in the phone’s software, exploits that can be worth millions of dollars and can take months to develop. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies typically have the legal authority to deploy spyware on targets, not the spyware makers themselves. Sara Banda, a spokesperson for Trenchant’s parent company L3Harris, declined to comment for this story when reached by TechCrunch before publication. A month before he received Apple’s threat notification, when Gibson was still working at Trenchant, he said he was invited to go to the company’s London office for a team-building event. When Gibson arrived on February 3, he was immediately summoned into a meeting room to speak via video call with Peter Williams, Trenchant’s then-general manager who was known inside the company as “Doogie.” (In 2018, defense contractor L3Harris acquired zero-day makers Azimuth and Linchpin Labs, two sister startups that merged to become Trenchant.) Williams told Gibson the company suspected he was double employed and was thus suspending him. All of Gibson’s work devices would be confiscated and analyzed as part of an internal investigation into the allegations. Williams could not be reached for comment. “I was in shock. I didn’t really know how to react because I couldn’t really believe what I was hearing,” said Gibson, who explained that a Trenchant IT employee then went to his apartment to pick up his company-issued equipment. Around two weeks later, Gibson said Williams called and told him that following the investigation, the company was firing him and offering him a settlement agreement and payment. Gibson said Williams declined to explain what the forensic analysis of his devices had found, and essentially told him he had no choice but to sign the agreement and depart the company. Feeling like he had no alternative, Gibson said he went along with the offer and signed. Gibson told TechCrunch he later heard from former colleagues that Trenchant suspected he had leaked some unknown vulnerabilities in Google’s Chrome browser, tools that Trenchant had developed. Gibson, and three former colleagues of his, however, told TechCrunch he did not have access to Trenchant’s Chrome zero-days, given that he was part of the team exclusively developing iOS zero-days and spyware. Trenchant teams only have strictly compartmentalized access to tools related to the platforms they are working on, the people said. “I know I was a scapegoat. I wasn’t guilty. It’s very simple,” said Gibson. “I didn’t do absolutely anything other than working my ass off for them.” The story of the accusations against Gibson and his subsequent suspension and firing was independently corroborated by three former Trenchant employees with knowledge. Two of the other former Trenchant employees said they knew details of Gibson’s London trip and were aware of suspected leaks of sensitive company tools. All of them asked not to be named but believe Trenchant got it wrong.

The organization also estimates that 37 million Americans will travel by plane and automobile over the holiday — a 60% increase over the same period last year. Be safe out on these busy roads, frens. One story to highlight: Mark Harris dug into the contracts for the Las Vegas Loop System. He found that restrictions put in place by Nevada regulators are making it difficult for The Boring Company to meet contractual targets for its LVCC Loop, Elon Musk’s first underground transportation system. Shortly after publication, Steve Hill, president of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA), tweeted that a Loop test this week, with a few hundred participants, had demonstrated its planned 4,400 passenger per hour capacity, which could release $13 million in construction funds currently being held back. While this bodes well for TBC, the story lays out a number of other issues that could pose a challenge for the company. We will continue to dig into this story of tunnels and transport. Now a request, dear reader. We’re a bit more than a week away from TC Sessions: Mobility 2021, a one-day virtual event scheduled for June 9 that is bringing together some of the best and brightest minds in transportation, including Mate Rimac of Rimac Automobili, Pam Fletcher of vp of global innovation at GM, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, Joby Aviation founder and CEO JoeBen Bevirt, investor and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, whose special purpose acquisition company just merged with Joby, and investors Clara Brenner of Urban Innovation Fund, Quin Garcia of Autotech Ventures and Rachel Holt of Construct Capital. I’d love for you to join, and you can do that by clicking here and buying a ticket, which will also give you a months-free subscription to Extra Crunch and access to all the videos of the conference. But, if you can’t come, please reach out anyway and let me know if you have any questions or topics that you want addressed. I will be interviewing many of the folks coming to our virtual stage. We just announced three more participants from automakers Hyundai, Ford and Toyota who will talk about their respective companies’ increasing interest and investment in robotics. Our three guests are: Max Bajracharya, formerly from Alphabet’s X and now vp of robotics at Toyota Research Institute, Ernestine Fu, director at Hyundai Motor Group who heads development at the new New Horizons Studio and Mario Santillo, a technical expert at Ford who has been charged with helping lead the company’s efforts at a recently announced $75 million research facility at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Micromobility rivals Bird and Lime have come out with news this week that they’re both marketing as sustainability initiatives. Let’s start with Bird. Bird has unveiled its next-generation scooter, the Bird Three, that it will unveil in New York and Berlin this summer. It’s got a longer-range battery with 1kWh capacity and an improved diagnostic monitoring system to keep the battery lasting as long as possible. Bird says its better, smarter battery means it’s ultimately a more sustainable scooter because it has a longer life and needs to be charged a lot less. Ideally, a better battery and better software will also help produce a longer-lasting vehicle so that Bird can cut down on depreciation and maintenance costs, which have really not helped the company in its push for profitability. Last week, Bird announced a SPAC merger with Switchback II. The regulatory filings that accompanied the announcement demonstrate just how difficult it is to turn a profit given the unit economics of shared scooters. Lime is similarly positioning its updated subscription service, Lime Prime, as a sustainable initiative. With each new Prime member sign up, Lime promises to plant a tree through One Tree Planted. But more importantly, the subscription service helps the regular Lime rider perhaps save a bit of money. Members have access to waived unlock fees on any vehicle, and in markets with no start fees, the benefit will be 25% off the ride price. Additionally, riders can get free 30 minute reservations on any vehicle. Zaiser Motors announced the launch of its Wefunder campaign to raise funds for development and production of its Electrocycle. It’s a good-lookin’ vehicle, charcoal-black with a design that breaks away from a super traditional gasoline-era style and looks more like something a small Batman might ride. All of the components are designed to be recyclable within the first 10 years of production, the company says. The Electrocycle has 300 miles of range, swappable batteries and is less than $25,000. Meanwhile in scooter world, the Scotsman, a Silicon Valley-based electric scooter brand, has unveiled a scooter that’s 3D printed entirely in carbon fiber composite. And I don’t just mean some parts are composite. The whole frame, the handlebars, the stem and the baseboard are all made of this strong, sustainable, lightweight material. It also means the scooters are highly customizable, each frame printed depending on the owner’s height, weight, arm and leg lengths and riding position. At a starting price of $2,999, it’s not cheap, but that might be a signal from the industry that scooters are increasingly become viable transport options and not just toys. You can pre-order here. The march of IPOs appears to picking up pace. For instance, Full Truck Alliance, the Chinese digital freight platform known as Manbang Group, filed for an IPO. The filing didn’t specify the exact amount it was aiming to raise. Reuters, citing unnamed sources, reported that the company wants to raise up to $1.5 billion, which would give it a valuation of $20 billion. Full Truck Alliance’s S-1 provides a number of interesting details, including the how much money can be captured by effectively connecting truckers with shippers. The company reported that about 20% of all China’s heavy-duty and medium-duty truckers fulfilled shipping orders on our platform in 2020. (More than 2.8 million truckers fulfilled shipping orders on its platform last year.) Full Truck Alliance said last year it facilitated 71.7 million fulfilled orders with a gross transaction value of RMB173.8 billion (US$26.6 billion). The first quarter number show it is growing. In the first quarter, the company had 22.1 million fulfilled orders, a 170.2% increase from the same period. Full Truck Alliance raised $3.6 billion in private funding, most recently last fall at an $11.7 billion valuation, from firms like SoftBank Vision Fund (22.2% pre-IPO stake), Sequoia Capital China (7.2%), Permira, Tencent, Hillhouse Capital, GGV Capital, Lightspeed China Partners and Baillie Gifford. The IPO about six months since the company raised $1.7 billion in a funding round that included backing from SoftBank Vision Fund, Sequoia Capital China, Permira, Fidelity, Hillhouse Capital, GGV Capital, Lightspeed China Partners, Tencent and Jack Ma’s YF Capital. A look at the S-1 shows that the principal shareholders are Softbank with a 22.2% stake, followed by 8.9% held by Full Load Logistics, a limited liability company owned by Full Truck Alliance CEO Hui Zhang. Sequoia has a 7.2% stake and Master Quality Group Limited, another organization controlled by Zhang, hold 6.6% of shares. Other deals that got my attention this week … E2open Parent Holdings Inc. said it will acquire logistics execution platform BluJay Solution, Freightwaves reported. The deal could be valued at $1.7 billion, consisting of $760 million in cash and 72.4 million shares. First Move Capital, the Boulder-based venture firm that has invested in used car marketplaces Frontier Auto Group and Vroom as well as mobility-as-a-service startup Via, has closed a new $150 million fund that will focus on the automotive and transportation sectors. Proceeds from the round will be exclusively allocated to new investments; seven have already been made, including into autonomous vehicle startup Gatik, cloud-based automotive retail platform Tekion and e-commerce startup Revolution Parts. Hydra Energy received CAD$15 million ($12 million) from Just Business to expand beyond pilots and deliver hydrogen-powered trucking, the company announced. This funding is to support the further development of Hydra’s initial waste hydrogen capture plant in British Columbia, its fueling infrastructure and conversion kits. The Canadian company has raised CAD $22 million (USD $17.2 million) to date. One other update worth sharing, Hydra’s flagship hydrogen-as-a-service project, is scheduled to break ground later this year. Miles, the German car-sharing service has received investment from Delivery Hero CFO Emmanuel Thomassin, HelloFresh CFO Christian Gärtner, Chargepoint CFO Rex Jackson as well as Norwegian top manager Stine Rolstad Brenna. Thomassin has joined the company’s advisory board. The company disclosed to TechCrunch that it generated 20 million euros ($24.39 million) of revenue in 2020, quadruple the amount from the previous year. The results helped the company achieve profitability in October 2020. Miles is now focused on expansion. In the first four months in 2021, the company launched electric vehicles and expanded its car fleet to Munich. Miles intends to grow beyond Germany and is currently examining the best markets to launch in. MotoRefi raised another $45 million in a round led by Goldman Sachs just five months after investors poured $10 million into the fintech startup to help turbocharge its auto refinancing business. While the company didn’t give me specifics on its revenue — CEO Kevin Bennett cited a 7x growth year-over-year but didn’t provide the baseline — it did disclose it’s on track to issue $1 billion in loans by the end of the year. That’s a fivefold increase from the same period last year. Smart Eye, the publicly traded Swedish company that supplies driver monitoring systems for a dozen automakers, acquired emotion-detection software startup Affectiva for $73.5 million in a cash-and-stock deal. The startup, which says it developed software that can detect and understand human emotion, spun out of MIT Media Lab in 2009. Since then, it has landed a number of development and proof of concept deals as well as raised capital, but it never quite reached the mass-scale production contracts. That’s where Smart Eye comes in. Smart Eye, which has won 84 production contracts with 13 OEMs, including BMW and GM, is keen to combine with its own AI-based eye-tracking technology. The companies’ founders see an opportunity to expand beyond driver monitoring systems — tech that is often used in conjunction with advanced driver assistance systems to track and measure awareness — and into the rest of the vehicle. Together, the technology could help them break into the emerging “interior sensing” market, which can be used to monitor the entire cabin of a vehicle and deliver services in response to the occupant’s emotional state. Tritium, a Brisbane-based developer and producer of direct current fast EV chargers, announced a merger agreement with a special purpose acquisition company Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corp. II. The deal is expected to value the company at $1.2 billion. The transaction is expected to generate gross proceeds of up to $403 million. Tritium will be listed under the ticker “DCFC.” This particular SPAC deal is unusual in that it does not include private investment in public equity, or PIPE — a fundraising round that typically occurs at the time of the merger and injects more capital into the company. Tritium CEO Jane Hunter told us that the company didn’t need a PIPE because DCRN is a more than $400 million SPAC and its shareholder group agreed to a minimum cash closing of just $200 million, which significantly reduces redemption risk. “Also, our revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 56% since 2016 as we expand our presence in major markets where we have a significant market share, such as the U.S. and Europe,” Hunter said. “This revenue growth helps to reduce our reliance upon new funds to implement our growth strategy.” Wejo, the connected vehicle data startup backed by GM and Palantir, plans to go public through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Virtuoso Acquisition Corp. The agreement, announced in a regulator filing, will give the combined company an enterprise valuation of $800 million, which includes debt. There were earlier reports that the SPAC deal was imminent. The filing confirms the news and provides more detail. The deal raises $330 million in proceeds for Wejo, including a $230 million cash contribution from Virtuoso and a $100 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE. Previous strategic investors Palantir and GM anchored the transaction, according to Wejo. The company did not disclose the amounts of those investments. Current shareholders will retain 64% ownership of the company, according to its investor deck. Senate Republicans released their response to Joe Biden’s sweeping $2 trillion investment plan, which would earmark $174 billion for electric vehicle investments. Their proposal would shrink it down to $928 billion. And that $174B for EVs? That would be reduced to just $4 billion, under the GOP plan. It seems that the main point of contention between the President and his GOP colleagues is the definition of the word ‘infrastructure.’ Republicans are sticking to a more traditional definition, so their counterproposal still contains plenty of money for things like roads, the water system, bridges and broadband. Biden’s plan aimed to provide consumer tax incentives and incentives for EV chargers, incentives to boost domestic manufacturing and enough funds to install at least 500,000 public charging stations across the country by 2030. A memo obtained by The Hill suggests Biden intends to hold firm to his proposal, so expect further negotiations in the coming weeks. The Senate Finance Committee on May 26 marked up the Clean Energy for America Act, an important step before it hits the Senate floor for a vote. Among other things, the bill would remove 200,000 unit cap on tax credits for consumers buying EVs — that means the tax credit could be used toward buying a Tesla, a manufacturer that hasn’t been eligible for the credit because they’ve sold over 200,000 cars in the United States. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) added an amendment to the bill that would create an additional $2,500 consumer credit for vehicles assembled in the U.S. and another $2,500 for vehicles assembled in a unionized facility. If it passes, the additions would bring the maximum consumer tax credit for EVs to $12,500 — no small sum! The credits would expire in 2025. “Electric vehicles are part of our transportation future,” Sen. Stabenow said. “The question is not when they will be built, it’s where they will be built: in Asia or America?” U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm sold her holdings in electric bus manufacturer Proterra after Republicans criticized her for a potential conflict of interest. The GOP’s complaint arose after Biden made a virtual visit to a Proterra factory in April. The sale provided Granholm with a net gain of $1.6 million, DOE told reporters. I hear and see things, but we’re not selfish. Let me share. This week, “a little bird” is all about big employment moves and departures and how one hire is connected to a potentially massive IPO. Let’s kick things off with Celina Mikolajczak, the now former vice president of battery technology at Panasonic Energy of North America. You might recall that Mikolajczak recently took a board seat at solid state battery company QuantumScape. Welp, she is now taking a job at the company as vice president of manufacturing engineering, beginning in July. She has resigned from the board in connection with accepting the offer. In her new role, Ms. Mikolajczak will lead the transition of the Company’s tools and manufacturing processes from research and development to production, QuantumScape said in a regularly filing. Mikolajczak has a long history researching and developing better lithium-ion batteries. Her technical consulting practice at Exponent focused on lithium-ion cell and battery safety and quality. She then took a senior management position at Tesla that was focused on cell quality and materials engineering. During her time at Tesla, Mikolajczak developed the battery cells and packs for Tesla’s Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Roadster Refresh. After leaving Tesla, Mikolajczak went on to serve as director of engineering focused on battery development for rideshare vehicles at Uber Technologies. And in 2019, she joined Panasonic Energy of North America, where she is vice president of battery technology. While at Panasonic, Mikolajczak led a team of more than 200 engineers and other technical staff to improve lithium-ion cell manufacturing and to bring the latest cell technologies to mass production for Tesla at the Gigafactory facility in Sparks, Nevada. Speaking of Tesla … it looks like Scott Sims, director of engineering, left the company this month. His title doesn’t quite capture his role. Sims was the person leading the design and engineering for vehicle user interfaces, streaming, video games and mobile applications. Importantly, he was responsible for cloud computing as it related to the Tesla mobile app, a critical tool for any owner. Finally, the big news on Friday (via Bloomberg) is that Rivian has selected underwriters for an initial public offering. The company could seek an eye-popping value of $70 billion. I have confirmed some (but not all) of Bloomberg’s reporting. Obviously big news that I’ll be watching and digging into. I had heard rumbling about a potential Rivian IPO, but Bloomberg put together the critical deets. To me, the biggest indication that Rivian was getting ready to make a move was Ger Dwyer taking the vp of business finance position at the company, which he posted about on LinkedIn. You might recall, that I scooped the news a couple of weeks ago that Dwyer was leaving his post as CFO at Waymo. I noted at the time that Dwyer’s departure comes at a time when the demand for CFOs has rocketed alongside the continuous string of public offerings, including those done via mergers with special purpose acquisition companies. Got tips? Send them my way by email or DM me over at Twitter. Loads and loads of news. Let’s get to it. Aurora published a blog post that gives a few new details on its testing and self-driving trucks strategy in Texas. The autonomous vehicle company said its first commercial pilots will move goods on several “middle-mile” routes in Texas. A safety driver will be behind the wheel of these self-driving trucks, which will drive autonomously between hubs. The terminal or hub system is one that other AV companies have adopted — at least for now. The idea is that loads can be consolidated, which would theoretically make operations more efficient. Aurora did add, that “for shippers and carriers with existing hubs and large volumes of freight, we expect to ultimately drive the complete route with no need for an intermediate consolidation point.” One other item that jumped out to me: the company is expanding into a second office in Texas, suggesting that they’re scaling up, at least in terms of people. Germany’s lower house of parliament adopted legislation that will allow driverless vehicles on public roads by 2022, laying out a path for companies to deploy robotaxis and delivery services in the country at scale. While autonomous testing is currently permitted in Germany, this would allow operations of driverless vehicles without a human safety operator behind the wheel. The bill still needs to pass through the upper chamber of parliament, or the Bundesrat. Included in the bill are possible initial applications for self-driving cars on German roads, such as public passenger transport, business and supply trips, logistics, company shuttles that handle employee traffic and trips between medical centers and retirement homes. PAVE, which stands for Partners for Autonomous Vehicle Education, piloted a workshop with local governments earlier this month throughout Ohio. The educational workshop, which was done in partnership with Drive Ohio, wasn’t open to the public. But my Autonocast podcast co-host Ed Niedermeyer, who also happens to be director of communications for PAVE, gave me the inside scoop on what went down. PAVE says it doesn’t do any kind of policy advocacy; instead the aim is to arm public policymakers with the facts they need to make good policy. This pilot helped PAVE lay a foundation for a curriculum that can be used elsewhere; that might seem trivial, but the complexity of issues around AVs makes these workshops with elected officials potentially powerful tool. Ed told me that one of the main challenges was educating on potentially controversial topics, like policy and regulation, “where we have to get facts across without imparting biases.” He noted that the organization’s public sector and academic advisory councils were both helpful as neutral authorities. Finally, he said that one of the most practical education PAVE did was around the best practices that its members and advisors have developed in early AV deployments. Kodiak Robotics, the U.S.-based self-driving truck startup, is partnering with South Korean conglomerate SK Inc. to explore the possibility of deploying its autonomous vehicle technology in Asia. While Kodiak co-founder and CEO Don Burnette couched the initial agreement as a first step toward a commercial enterprise in Asia, the reach of SK shouldn’t be discounted. SK Inc., a holding company of SK Group, has more than 120 operating companies, including ones connected to the logistics industry. The ultimate aim of the partnership is to sell and distribute Kodiak’s self-driving technology in the region. Kodiak will examine how it can use SK’s products, components and technology for its autonomous system, including artificial intelligence microprocessors and advanced emergency braking systems. Both companies have also agreed to work together to provide fleet management services for customers in Asia. Ford Motor, fresh off its splashy F-150 Lightning electric truck reveal, announced it is pushing its investment in EVs up to $30 billion by 2025, up from a previous spend of $22 billion by 2023. The company announced the fresh cashflow into its EV and battery development strategy, dubbed Ford+, during its investor day. The company said it expects 40% of its global vehicle volume to be fully electric by 2030. Ford sold 6,614 Mustang Mach-Es in the U.S. in Q1, and since it unveiled its F-150 Lightning last week, the company says it has already amassed 70,000 customer reservations. Hyundai held the North American reveal of the upcoming all-electric Ioniq 5 crossover. One new detail that I found interesting: Hyundai developed an in-car payment system that will debut in the Ioniq 5. The feature will offer drivers the ability to find and pay for EV charging, food and parking. When the vehicle comes to North America in fall 2021, the payments system will launch with Dominoes, ParkWhiz and Chargehub. Lordstown Motors’ cash-rich SPAC dreams have turned out to be nothin’ more than wishes, as Alex Wilhelm and Aria Alamalhodaei reported. The upshot: a disappointing first-quarter earnings that was a pile-up of red-ink-stained negativity. The lowlights include higher-than-expected forecasted expenses, a need to raise more capital and lower-than-anticipated production of its Endurance vehicle this year — from around 2,200 vehicles to just 1,000. In short, the company is set to consume more cash than the street expected and is further from mass production of its first vehicle than promised. Lucid Motors revealed the in-cabin tech of its upcoming electric luxury Air sedan. I spoke to Derek Jenkins, who heads up design at Lucid, and he provided a detailed tour of all the tech in the vehicle. It goes far beyond the curved 34-inch display and second touchscreen, which received much of the attention. The user experience, particularly the underlying software, matters in all cars. But it can be the death of an electric vehicle model if not done properly. It appears Lucid is on the right track. I won’t really know until I’m able to test the Air. Let’s hope that is soon. Rivian has delayed deliveries of the R1T Launch Edition, the limited edition release of its first series of “electric adventure vehicles,” by a month. Customers who preordered can now expect to start receiving their pickup trucks in July instead of June, with Launch Edition deliveries to be completed by spring 2022. The one-month delay was due to a combination of small issues, including delays on shipping containers, the ongoing chip shortage as well as ensuring the servicing piece is properly set up. It’s worth noting that Rivian told me that it has been largely unaffected by the chip shortage compared to the rest of the industry because its products don’t require as many as other vehicles on the market today. Tesla had a number of news items this week, so I’ll just point to the most notable ones. Tesla has established a data center in China to carry out the “localization of data storage,” with plans to add more data facilities in the future, the company announced through its account on microblogging platform Weibo. All data generated by Tesla vehicles sold in mainland China will be kept domestically. The move was in response to new requirements drafted by the Chinese government to regulate how cameras- and sensors-enabled carmakers collect and utilize data. One of the requirements states that “personal or important data should be stored within the [Chinese] territory.” Finally, two safety-related pieces of Tesla news that seem in opposition to each other. First, Tesla started delivering Model 3 and Model Y vehicles without radar, fulfilling a vision of CEO Elon Musk to only use cameras combined with machine learning to support its advanced driver assistance system and other active safety features. The decision has prompted blowback though from the National Traffic Highway and Safety Administration, Consumer Reports and IIHS over safety concerns. Meanwhile, Tesla finally — and after loud and frequent urging from industry and safety advocates, activated the in-cabin camera in new Model Y and Model 3 vehicles. The camera will be used as a driver monitoring system. Tesla has been criticized for not activating the driver monitoring system within its vehicles even as evidence mounted that owners were misusing the system. Owners have posted dozens of videos on YouTube and TikTok abusing its advanced driver assistance system known as Autopilot — some of whom have filmed themselves sitting in the backseat as the vehicle drives along the highway. Apex.AI hired Paul Balciunas as its CFO. Balciunas was the former CFO of Canoo. He also was an executive at Deutsche Bank, where he acted as a lead underwriter of the initial public offering for Tesla in 2010, and has since focused on auto tech and new mobility players. Blyncsy, a Utah-based startup movement and data intelligence company launched an AI-powered technology called Payver, that will use crowdsourced video data to give transport agencies up-to-date information on which roads require maintenance and improvements. Blyncsy is offering this service to governments at a reduced cost and with no long-term commitment. Utah’s DOT will be the first to pilot the program beginning June 1, deploying Payver in the Salt Lake County region, which covers more than 350 road miles. Blyncsy will be announcing other pilots in different states over the next few weeks. Scale AI hired Mark Valentine to head up its federal-focused division. Valentine comes with experience and connections. He was a commander in the U.S. Air Force, senior military advisor to FEMA and most recently, GM of national security for Microsoft. He will lead Scale’s government partnership efforts. Scale has also hired Michael Kratsios, the former CTO of the White House, as managing director and head of strategy. The company said he is focused on accelerating the development of AI across industries. Michael joined at the end of Q1. Bring a +1 and save 60%Have a +1 you’d like to bring to Disrupt?

    "content": "Home goods company Kohler recently unveiled a new device called the Dekoda — a $599 camera that can be attached to your toilet bowl and take pictures of what’s inside. CNET reports that the Dekoda analyzes these images in order to provide updates on your gut health and hydration, and to potentially detect blood. It also comes with a rechargeable battery, a USB connection, and a fingerprint sensor to identify who’s using the toilet. The Dekoda is currently available for preorder, with shipments scheduled to begin on October 21. In addition to the hardware purchase fee, customers will need to pay between $70 and $156 per year for a subscription. If you’re uneasy about the privacy implications of putting a camera right below your private parts, the company says, “Dekoda’s sensors see down into your toilet and nowhere else.” It also notes that the resulting data is secured via end-to-end encryption.

    "content": "Silicon Valley used to take a backseat to Washington, D.C. But now, the people disrupting technology have taken the wheel at the highest echelons of government. And that’s thanks, in large part, to the Department of Government Efficiency, better known as DOGE. Much reporting on DOGE has focused on its staffers’ ties to Musk, the billionaire bestie of President Donald Trump. However, there’s another major nexus: the Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors who have joined its clarion call of slashing government spending. TechCrunch has compiled a comprehensive list of the founders and VCs who have worked with DOGE, identified through a combination of personal declarations, court records, and other reporting. Our research also reveals one previously unreported DOGE member, Mike Gonzalez, the former founder of an HR startup called TraceHQ. And Gonzalez is far from the only Silicon Valley founder to find a new role in public service. Our roster of founders-turned-DOGE workers spans from the co-founder of Airbnb to a guy who sold his startup for nearly $1 billion — only to join DOGE to find a higher meaning after breaking up with his girlfriend. Then there are the VCs. This contingent includes Silicon Valley titan Marc Andreessen — a self-described “unpaid intern” at DOGE — and one man who spent seven years working for Thiel Capital before joining the top levels of government. Regardless of how you feel about DOGE, there’s no question that Silicon Valley’s influence on the federal government is stronger than ever. To find out who is shaping that future, read on. Cavanaugh is the co-founder of two startups: Brainbase, an enterprise SaaS business which he sold in 2022, and FlowFi, which raised $9 million last year to build a marketplace of finance experts for entrepreneurs. He is part of a DOGE team tasked with auditing — some would say dismantling — the USADF and IAF, two U.S. government agencies that fund development projects in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, according to a lawsuit from USADF president Ward Brehm. Although Cavanaugh has no public history of political activities, he looks to Trump backer Peter Thiel for “a lot” of his thinking about the world and business, he said in an interview with VC firm Differential Ventures. Ehikian has sold two companies to Salesforce: Airkit.ai in 2023 and RelateIQ in 2014. Ehikian worked in product at Salesforce twice after the acquisition of his companies, most recently serving as VP of AI products. Trump appointed Ehikian as acting administrator and deputy administrator of GSA in January. This agency is the cornerstone of purchasing contracts for the federal government. In his role, Ehikian manages GSA’s real estate portfolio and doles out government contracts for technology. He has said that the GSA would terminate leases and cut consulting contracts, and has been firing GSA employees. California Senator Alex Padilla and New York Congressman Joseph Morelle wrote a letter in March to Ehikian, opposing his work with DOGE on such matters. Fulcher is the founder of RingMD, a Singapore-based telehealth startup. Fulcher made headlines in 2013 after the government of Singapore funded RingMD with $500,000 when he was only 21. Despite expanding to multiple countries in Asia, RingMD has since gone bankrupt, according to Forbes. Fulcher, now 32, was installed by DOGE to oversee reforms at the Veterans Administration (VA), which cut 1,000 staff soon after DOGE’s arrival. Gebbia is the billionaire co-founder of Airbnb and Samara, a pre-fab tiny home startup that raised $41 million in 2023. He is also a personal friend of Elon Musk, who had been deliberating buying one of Samara’s tiny homes last year, according to Tesla filings. At DOGE, Gebbia will work as a volunteer in the Office of Personnel Management, he confirmed in a post on X after his involvement was reported by The New York Times. “My first project at DOGE is improving the slow and paper-based retirement process,” Gebbia wrote. Gebbia is a longtime Democratic donor, but said he voted for Trump in 2024 and supports Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new health secretary. Gonzalez founded HR startup TraceHQ in 2019 and sold it to Paylocity in 2023 for an undisclosed sum. Gonzalez says on his website that he started his career as a Facebook product manager and worked at Zenefits with David Sacks when he was CEO there, all before launching his own company. VC Sacks has joined the Trump administration as its crypto and AI czar. Gonzalez was working on the finance team when they worked together at Zenefits. Gonzalez’s LinkedIn profile previously mentioned that he joined DOGE full-time earlier this month as a “Senior Advisor” at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. Shortly after TechCrunch reached out to Gonzalez for comment, the mention of DOGE was removed from his LinkedIn profile. Gonzalez has not said what he’s doing at OPM. But in February he wrote a post on LinkedIn lamenting the state and process of the federal budget. Hiremath is the co-founder of video recording startup Loom, which was sold to Atlassian in 2023 for $975 million. According to a blog post on his personal website titled “I am rich and have no idea what to do with my life,” Hiremath says that after breaking up with his girlfriend, he decided to “externalize” his emotions by climbing a mountain in the Himalayas. After that, he decided to work for DOGE. His stint at DOGE lasted about a month and involved making hundreds of recruiting calls. Hiremath wrote that he was added to Signal groups run by DOGE and “immediately put to work.” Hiremath praised DOGE’s work as “extremely important,” but said he quit the job as he needed to focus on himself. He called off plans to move to Washington, D.C. and went to Hawaii instead, his post states. Morgan is the co-founder and former CEO of an Austin-based edtech startup called Podium Education, a press release from last year shows, although he is not currently listed as a leader on the company’s website. His social media presence is extremely minimal but he has reportedly been involved in edtech for well over a decade, previously working for a long-since acquired company that offered a Facebook app for schools. Morgan is said to be involved in DOGE’s efforts at the Education Department, especially around efforts to augment — perhaps replace — some of the workers there with AI, The New York Times reports. Schutt is listed by Crunchbase as a co-founder of a Virginia-based software company called KAMM, which state records say has been inactive as of late November 2024. Schutt has also worked on WinRed, WIRED reports, a for-profit fundraising site that says it’s helped raise $1.8 billion for Republican party candidates since 2023. He also served as the CTO at online fundraising platform REVV, also used by the Republican party. He is a member of DOGE and is now on staff at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, according to an internal staff directory viewed by Politico. He was previously at the GSA. He is said to have access to FEMA systems and to have worked for a company called Outburst Data which hosts several Musk-related sites, and hosts parts of the DOGE website. Shaotran was previously the founder of Energize.ai, though its website no longer loads. He also developed several iPhone apps, including a Donald Trump-themed running game called “Donald Dash.” In 2024, Shaotran told Business Insider that he was a 22-year-old Harvard computer science student working solo on his startup, which offered an AI scheduling assistant and had landed a $100,000 grant from OpenAI. Shaotran was one of a number of DOGE workers named in a lawsuit by federal employees that sought to prevent DOGE workers from accessing federal records, although he was not a defendant. Shaotran reportedly has a working GSA email address and requested access to a decade’s worth of GSA data. Shaotran also has access to email systems at the Department of Education and access to the department’s back-end website, NBC reported. Smith is a longtime healthcare entrepreneur who co-founded the palliative care company Aspire Health (later acquired by Anthem) and co-founded CareBridge, which provides at-home service to Medicaid patients (and is said to have struck a deal with Elevance Health to sell for $2.7 billion). He also co-founded healthcare VC firm Russell Street Ventures and served as CEO of Main Street Health, which offers primary care services to those in rural areas. Smith led the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation during President Trump’s first term. He is said to be one of the leaders of DOGE, alongside close Musk ally Steve Davis. As ABC News reported, Smith has been an advocate for privatizing aspects of Medicaid and Medicare. At DOGE, Smith has requested access to the payment systems at Medicare, according to The New York Times. Wick is the co-founder of Y Combinator startup Intercept. He also worked as an engineer at Alphabet’s self-driving car company Waymo, he told a podcast in 2024. He is among the DOGE staffers granted extensive access to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s data, according to a lawsuit from former USAID contractors which names him (but not as a defendant). Wick graduated from MIT with a degree in computer science in 2019 and also has a master’s degree from there, according to an archived version of his website. He also worked at YC-backed logistics startup Flexport. Akis is a co-founder and president of Silicon Valley VC firm Human Capital. He reportedly led inquiries into the Treasury Department’s payments systems, The New York Times reported. He was also named in a lawsuit about DOGE’s legality, although not as a defendant. Akis is the second link to DOGE from Human Capital. The VC firm’s former head of talent, Amanda Scales, is now chief of staff at the powerful Office of Personnel Management, the federal government’s HR department. Andreessen is the co-founder of prominent VC firm Andreessen Horowitz. He famously backed Trump for president in 2024, despite previously endorsing Hillary Clinton in 2016. Andreessen described himself as an “unpaid intern” for DOGE in a podcast with the Hoover Institution earlier this year, reportedly helping recruit for DOGE’s early hires, the FT reported. In the Hoover Institution podcast, Andreessen described former a16z managing partner Scott Kupor — and incoming OPM head — as “very aligned” with DOGE’s mission. Gracias is the founder and CEO of Valor Equity Partners, and a longtime close associate of Elon Musk. Valor has invested in a who’s who of buzzy startups (including Anduril, Dataminr, Eight Sleep, and Reddit) but is particularly known for backing Musk companies like SpaceX, Neuralink, SolarCity, The Boring Company, and Tesla. Gracias is well known as a Tesla board member from 2007 to 2021, on the board prior to its IPO as well as when Tesla bought the Musk-controlled company SolarCity for $2.6 billion. On a February episode of the VC All-In Podcast, Gracias said that he was working with DOGE. “I’m not there full-time,” he said. “I’m in and out a little bit and trying to help where I can.” He also mentioned that DOGE had 80-plus full-time people at that time. He is apparently now working with DOGE’s efforts at the Social Security Administration, The New York Times reported, and is one of nine DOGE associates there. Other Valor employees are also part of the Social Security crew, the NYT reports. Until recently, Michael Kratsios served as managing director at Scale AI, the data labeling startup that began working with the Pentagon last year to test and evaluate AI tools for the military. From 2010 to 2017, Kratsios worked for Thiel Capital, the office that manages VC Peter Thiel’s many investments, per his LinkedIn; Thiel was one of Trump’s early backers in 2016. Kratsios also served as CTO of the U.S. during Trump’s first administration. Kratsios helped lead efforts to staff DOGE in late 2024 by conducting interviews of prospective staff, Bloomberg reported. He is Trump’s pick to lead the Office of Science and Technology Policy. During his confirmation hearing, Kratsios responded to questions about mass firings of federal workers by saying he believes it’s reasonable for the current administration to evaluate current talent. Kupor is a managing partner at VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, and was a16z’s first employee. He serves on the boards of a number of a16z investments. He is also a former chairman of the National Venture Capital Association — the VC industry’s lobbying organization. Trump announced in December 2024 that he picked Kupor to serve as the director of the Office of Personnel Management. The same day, Kupor confirmed that he was helping DOGE. As the federal government’s HR department, the OPM has become ground zero for DOGE’s mission to slash the federal workforce. DOGE workers are using OPM’s data and computer systems to obtain information about federal workers across agencies, according to a CNN report. Maguire is a partner at Sequoia Capital and formerly co-founded cyber firm Expanse, which was sold to Palo Alto Networks for $800 million in 2020. Maguire has reportedly helped screen potential candidates for DOGE. He’s a frequent and vocal supporter of DOGE on X. Maguire is an outspoken supporter of President Trump, and announced that he donated $300,000 to his campaign last summer. Ramada was previously a managing director at SpringTide Capital, where he was part of a $12 million deal to fund the probiotic drink company ZBiotics. His firm also invested in a SpaceX supplier last year. He was identified as a member of DOGE in a temporary restraining order after the American Federation of Teachers sought to block DOGE’s access to privileged information. The restraining order was later denied by a federal judge. In a signed declaration, Ramada said he started working for DOGE in January, assigned to audit contracts and programs at the Department of Education for waste, such as federal student loans. President Trump, a critic of the Department of Education, recently signed an executive order to start its closure very soon. In another declaration, Ramada, who is also listed as a GSA employee, said he was assigned to the Labor Department, too, to “improve its information technology and data organization system.” Scales worked for two and half years at Silicon Valley VC firm Human Capital, advising the firm’s portfolio companies on talent and HR, according to her her LinkedIn profile. Her boss at Human Capital, its co-founder Baris Akis, served as a DOGE advisor. Scales is now chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management, the federal government’s powerful human resources department, according to an OPM memo. Scales previously worked on talent at Uber before joining Human Capital, according to her LinkedIn.

    "content": "One day before its scheduled IPO, Tesla Motors is increasing the allotment of shares that will be sold to the public from 11.1 million to 13.3 million, according to an amendment to its S1 filing. The additional shares are being sold by existing shareholders looking to cash out at the IPO, including Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk who is selling an additional 909,212 of his personal shares. Other selling stockholders include VantagePoint Venture Partners (238,748 shares), Bay Area Equity Fund (88,586), Westly Capital Partners (72,625), Compass Venture Partners (22,931), as well as friends and family like Elon’s brother (and OneRiot CEO) Kimball Musk (12,692). Tesla itself won’t make any additional money from the bump in shares, but more shares will be available to the public. If Tesla shares open at the high end of its expected range of $14 to $16, the Silicon Valley electric car company will debut with a $1.5 billion market cap (based on 93.5 million total shares outstanding after the IPO and a concurrent $50 million private placement with Toyota). After the offering, Tesla’s largest shareholder will still be founder Elon Musk, who will own 28.4 percent of the company (worth $426 million at that valuation, versus a potential windfall of $14.5 million for the shares he is selling). The second largest shareholder will be Daimler (through an investment arm called Blackstar Investco) with 8 percent of the shares, and the third largest will be the government of Abu Dhabi (through Al Wahada Capital Investment) with 7.8 percent of the shares. The two biggest VC shareholders will be Vantage Capital Partners with 6.6 percent and Valor Equity Partners with 5.25 percent. It takes a ton of money to crack into the car business. Even before the IPO proceeds, Tesla has already raised $783 million in venture capital and government loans. Tesla is expecting to raise about $210 million in the IPO, bringing the total raised to just over $1 billion. And so far the company isn’t making any money. Last year, Tesla lost $56 million on revenues of $112 million. In the March quarter of 2010, it lost $29.5 million on revenues of $20.8 million. As of March 31, 2010, the company still had $188 million in cash. But it expects to spend up to $125 million this year, as it gears up to manufacture its Model S sedan (including $42 million to buy a factory in Fremont, California formerly operated by Toyota and GM). While Tesla is known for its sexy roadster, it the Model S which will make or break the company. It is a more affordable electric sedan which the company hopes will start to make inroads with the general car-buying public.

    "content": "An outage on Monday affected web hosting giant Amazon Web Services (AWS), which took out vast swathes of the web, including websites, banks, and some government services. On Monday afternoon, the company offered an update on the cause of the issue and said it was working to restore services. At 6:01 p.m. ET, Amazon said all AWS services had returned to normal operations. In an announcement on the Amazon website, the company shared that the underlying issue was related to DNS resolution. DNS, or Domain Name System, is a system that converts web addresses into IP addresses so that customer apps and websites can load. While some glitches can be resolved quickly, DNS issues can sometimes take longer to resolve. “AWS reported increased error rates for multiple services and determined that the issue was related to DNS resolution of the DynamoDB API endpoints in the N. Virginia (us-east-1) Region,” the announcement stated. “The underlying DNS issue was fully mitigated at 2:24 AM PDT.” Though the issue itself was fixed, Amazon needed more time to “fully restore service,” which it said it was doing “as quickly as possible.” The company also said that the issue affected Amazon.com and its subsidiaries, as well as AWS customer support operations. Amazon said on Monday evening Eastern time that the outage had been “fully mitigated” and that most services are returning to normal after an hours-long stretch during which much of the internet could not load. Several major apps were not working. Coinbase, Fortnite, Signal, Perplexity, Venmo, and Zoom faced lengthy outages, as did Amazon’s own services, including its Ring video surveillance products. The outage even disrupted Eight Sleep’s cooling pods, disturbing the sleep of users. Millions of companies and organizations rely on AWS to host their websites, apps, and other critical online systems. The company has data centers all over the world, and Amazon is said to have at least 30% of the total cloud market. Before this, the most recent global internet outage was in 2024, when cybersecurity giant CrowdStrike published a buggy update to its anti-malware engine, causing millions of computers around the world to crash and resulting in airport delays and mass outages. Systems globally took several days to return to normal. Prior to that, a malfunction at DNS provider Akamai in 2021 caused some of the world’s largest websites to drop off the internet for several hours, including FedEx, Steam, and the PlayStation Network. Amazon advised customers to refer to the AWS Health Dashboard for more detailed information on the outage and how it was being resolved. Zack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "content": "The tech layoff wave is still kicking in 2025. Last year saw more than 150,000 job cuts across 549 companies, according to independent layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi. So far this year, more than 22,000 workers have been the victim of reductions across the tech industry, with a staggering 16,084 cuts taking place in February alone. We’re tracking layoffs in the tech industry in 2025 so you can see the trajectory of the cutbacks and understand the impact on innovation across all types of companies. As businesses continue to embrace AI and automation, this tracker serves as a reminder of the human impact of layoffs — and what could be at stake with increased innovation.

The company expects a $160–180 million charge for the layoffs, mainly in Q4 of fiscal 2025. Laid off around 100 employees in October, about 15% of its 650-person U.S. workforce. The layoffs affected various roles across its recruiting business vertical. The San Francisco-based startup is an online platform connecting college students and recent graduates with employers for early-career jobs. Has reportedly laid off over 120 employees amid a leadership transition following CEO Mark Mader’s retirement.

Is reportedly laying off over 500 employees due to AI and automation improving back-office efficiencies. The Oklahoma City-based HR and payroll software company will provide affected workers with severance packages, outplacement services, and access to internal job opportunities.

The San Francisco-based conversational AI company, which is preparing for an IPO within two years, raised $60 million in equity and debt in July. Laid off about a third of its data annotation team, cutting roughly 500 jobs, according to Business Insider. The move comes as the company shifts focus from generalist AI tutors to specialist roles, after testing workers to assess their strengths. Employees were told they’ll be paid through the end of their contracts — or November 30 at the latest — but their system access was cut immediately, Business Insider reports. Has reportedly laid off about 200 workers, or 1.5% of its staff, as the company braces for the end of federal EV tax credits under President Trump’s policy changes. The $7,500 incentive for new electric cars expires this month, adding to pressure from cooling demand. Despite the cuts, Rivian says it’s moving ahead with plans for a lower-cost model. Is cutting another 101 jobs in Seattle and 254 in San Francisco, just weeks after a wave of layoffs in August. The company, which had about 3,900 local employees before the cuts, hasn’t explained the move and declined to comment. Is trimming another 262 jobs at its San Francisco headquarters, according to a state filing, with layoffs set to take effect November 3. The move comes just weeks after CEO Marc Benioff touted AI’s potential to cut customer support roles and follows a smaller round of cuts in Seattle and Bellevue earlier this month. Will eliminate 221 positions across its Milpitas and San Francisco offices, including 157 in Santa Clara County and 64 in San Francisco, effective October 13, according to filings with California’s Employment Development Department reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. The cuts are part of the company’s broader workforce-reduction strategy. Laid off about 100 employees last month, around 9% of its workforce, after falling short of ambitious growth targets. The cuts affected staff across all departments. The company provides back-office software for restaurant chains. Is set to cut 101 jobs at its Santa Clara location, with notices issued on August 13 and terminations effective October 13. The company, which recently disclosed nearly 200 layoffs at its Pleasanton and Redwood City offices, is also planning to lay off 161 employees in Seattle, according to filings with the Washington state Employment Security Department. Is cutting 106 positions at its Seattle and Liberty Lake, Washington, offices, according to a state Employment Security Department filing.

Will cut 6% of its workforce in its sixth layoff in just over a year. Peloton CEO Peter Stern said the cuts are needed to improve long-term business health.

Laid off 30 employees and is now offering buyouts to the remaining 200. The AI coding startup recently acquired by Cognition has had a rocky stretch, including a near-acquisition by OpenAI and a reverse-acqui-hire by Google that saw key talent depart before Cognition stepped in. Despite initial promises to value Windsurf’s team, the deal now looks more focused on the startup’s intellectual property than its people. Is cutting 100 jobs, and its CEO, Jen Sargent, is departing. Amazon is reorganizing its audio operations, moving Wondery’s audio-only podcasts under Audible and placing video-focused shows into a new Creator Services division. Amazon acquired Wondery in 2020. Has cut 150 roles in customer service and support, following enhancements to its platform and tools that have significantly reduced support needs. The decision came via a prerecorded message from CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes, just hours before co-founder Scott Farquhar urged Australia to embrace an “AI revolution” and move beyond “jobs of the past” in an Australian Press Club address. The Australian software firm was founded 2002. Is cutting about 7% of its workforce, or 47 employees, as part of a push toward profitability, Bloomberg reports.

Has laid off 29 employees as part of its reorganization, per a report by Blockworks. The Seattle-based research and engineering startup recently launched EigenCloud, a platform that provides blockchain-level trust guarantees for any Web 2.0 or web3 application. The reduction will affect 25% of the company’s workforce. Eigen Labs said it had raised $70 million in tokens from a16z Crypto in June. Will cut 9,000 employees, which is less than 4% of its global workforce across teams, role types, and geographies. The reduction follows a series of layoffs earlier this year: It cut less than 1% of the headcount in January, more than 6,000 in May, and at least 300 in June. Is laying off 65 employees in Bellevue, Washington, according to media reports. The parent company of TikTok arrived in Seattle in 2021 and has been expanding its presence there by growing its TikTok Shop online shopping division.

    "content": "“Hoisted by their own GPTards.” That’s how Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun described the blowback after OpenAI researchers did a victory lap over GPT-5’s supposed math breakthroughs. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis added, “This is embarrassing.” The Decoder reports that in a since-deleted tweet, OpenAI VP Kevin Weil declared that “GPT-5 found solutions to 10 (!) previously unsolved Erdős problems and made progress on 11 others.” (“Erdős problems” are famous conjectures posed by mathematician Paul Erdős.) However, mathematician Thomas Bloom, who maintains the Erdos Problems website, said Weil’s post was “a dramatic misrepresentation” — while these problems were indeed listed as “open” on Bloom’s website, he said that only means “I personally am unaware of a paper which solves it.” In other words, it’s not accurate to claim GPT-5 was able to solve previously unsolved problems. Instead, Bloom wrote, “GPT-5 found references, which solved these problems, that I personally was unaware of.” Sebastien Bubeck, an OpenAI researcher who’d also been touting GPT-5’s accomplishments, then acknowledged that “only solutions in the literature were found,” but he suggested this remains a real accomplishment: “I know how hard it is to search the literature.” Bring a +1 and save 60%Have a +1 you’d like to bring to Disrupt?

    "content": "It was another dizzying week here at Extra Crunch as you will shortly see in this newsletter. One change that we are making: we are simplifying our newsletters to keep you better informed on what is happening on Extra Crunch. We are merging the daily, weekly, and article editions of this newsletter into a “roundup” format that will come out twice per week. The goal is to keep the signal high, and the noise in your inbox low. To control which newsletters you receive from Extra Crunch (and TechCrunch more broadly), feel free to go to our newsletters page while logged in. And as always, if you have feedback, do let me know at danny@techcrunch.com. TechCrunch’s scooter aficionado Megan Rose Dickey dived into the current state of the scooter market, and came back decidedly non-plussed. Scooters seem like a viable solution to the last-mile problem of urban transportation, but the reality is that the sharing economics behind them are weak, and huge regulatory barriers are being erected that will almost certainly slow their advance. Even worse, sharing may disappear entirely: What’s not clear at this point in the early days of micromobility is if people are adopting the shared model or simply just adopting new forms of transportation. This is where the question of shared versus ownership comes in. “Do you get your own one of these things — a board, scooter, bike — or do you just assume super high availability and find that more convenient? Buried in that are a lot of other things,” [Shaun Abrahamson, managing partner at city and mobility-focused VC fund Urban.us, said]. “People have vehicles as sort of a fashion accessory. Maybe you want to tweak it for more performance. Having what is effectively a fleet vehicle, which will be more optimized for ruggedness, is not optimized for performance. It’s not an extension of self-expression.” This week we had many conversations about Lyft. On TechCrunch’s Equity podcast, Kate Clark and Alex Wilhelm discussed the latest ups-and-downs with Lyft’s IPO, and you can read the transcript here as a member benefit. We also conducted an Extra Crunch exclusive conference call with Kate Clark and Kirsten Korosec on Lyft, discussing the company’s past and future. If you missed the call, you can read the transcript here. From that conversation: Kirsten [Korosec]: So something to keep an eye on. It reminds me a lot of a company I write a lot about, which is Tesla, and I’ve been covering them for years. And it’s one of the most volatile stocks, and their investors, they certainly have large, institutional investors, but the number of fanboys that they have with smaller investors, either prop up the share price sometimes or add to that volatility, and I’m kind of really curious to see if that happens with Lyft. If you go to a shareholder meeting at Tesla, for example, it’s filled with people who are passionate about the brand and its CEO, Elon Musk. And Lyft and possibly Uber, if they end up finally going through with their IPO, you can see that potentially happening because people feel very strongly about the brand and also the service it provides. So I’m curious to see how this all sort of shakes out. And I tend to take the view that I invest personally in mutual funds and things like that. I don’t invest in any of these companies, but the long, patient view tends to be the better one, and trying to catch a falling knife, as investors have told me, is never really a good idea. Talking about ridesharing and transcripts, one experimental feature we have been trialing with Extra Crunch is offering transcripts of popular podcast episodes relevant to the membership. This week, we have the transcript of a ‘This is Your Life in Silicon Valley’ episode interviewing the New York Times’ Mike Isaac on Uber’s situation with the press. Isaac also talked about the process of acquiring leaks: So you cover Facebook. You cover a lot. One thing I’m really curious about is just not speaking specifically about Facebook but the companies you cover, Uber, et cetera. Tell me about leaks. So employee leaks, so there’s this whole phenomenon of you get these leaks. Are they increasing? How does a leak even work? I mean, I don’t have any sources obviously, but just tactically speaking, when someone leaks something to you, how does that even work? I have found, you know what’s really funny? Historically Facebook is not a leaky company. They have actually had a really good reputation for being super tight. It’s hard to break in there. And I’ve written about them for probably like 10 years now. I starting writing about them in 2010. That’s back when everything was happy. Right, no, when Facebook was still like cool, when youngs were on it, when it wasn’t just old guys like us farting around and taking pics. And so back in the day, you sort of like bought into this cult of Facebook. Everyone loved it, and all the people that were there working there really liked it. The thing that I notice with companies, and I wrote about Uber last year during its insanity and downfall is that leaks are just a symptom of bigger problems inside of the company. When people leak, when people talk to people like me, it’s because they’re usually unhappy or they have some sort of motivation to do so because they’re trying to get some sort of result. I mean, that’s one of the reasons: They’re trying to get some sort of result. So Facebook is having, if you just watch the news, more leaks than they ever had probably in their history, and that’s because people are just not happy. And they’re starting to really grapple with the idea that maybe things they’re doing are not all good, or maybe the company is not entirely a positive force for the world. If you are sick and tired of ridesharing and want to get away from the urban hubs (or just rainy San Francisco), remote work might be just the ticket. Our writer Sherwood Morrison dives into the growing clout of remote workers in the tech industry: Moving around slowly, on the other hand, can offer significant benefits. Matt Mullenweg, whose startup Automattic is the second-largest remote company, advises approaching travel strategically. “With proper planning, travel can allow you to bootstrap community in different locations, connect with customers, meet non-traditional investors or advisors, and recruit talented colleagues outside of the normal fishing grounds of the internet giants. Something closer to ‘slowmad’ than ‘nomad’ is probably the right approach,” he told TechCrunch. We sent out an article-specific email this week, but in case you didn’t catch it all (hah!), TechCrunch editor Greg Kumparak published his second part of the Niantic EC-1, focused on the challenges the company experienced in building and launching Pokémon GO. I have part three in my hands as I write this, and I’m looking forward to publishing the final two parts of this popular series. Niantic nearly failed in its launch of Pokémon GO due to scaling struggles with Google Cloud. Our enterprise writer Ron Miller discusses the issue of the public cloud and its relation with startups, finding that the alternatives always seem better than they really are: There have been multiple attempts to break the Amazon hegemony around the cloud market, including the aforementioned competition from Microsoft and others. Perhaps the most visible open-source attempt was OpenStack, which was launched as a joint open-source project between Rackspace and NASA in 2010. The mission was to come up with an open-source way to manage public and private clouds. One of the primary motivations for this was that companies were looking for a way to take advantage of the public cloud without getting dependent on these commercial systems, which primarily meant AWS at the time. While OpenStack worked in its own way, it never really gained as much traction as was hoped at the time, beyond some high-profile customers like the telecom market, along with Walmart and Comcast. Legendary Wall Street investor Peter Kraus’ next mission is to go after the passive investment industry typified by index fund giant Vanguard and startups like Wealthfront. With his new venture Aperture, he wants to bring back the mutual fund — yes, that antiquated investment model — for a new generation of investors. Our fintech writer Gregg Schoenberg has the two-part interview and the scoop on this latest financial innovation (read part 1 here, and part 2 here). GS: I agree with you on that and took note when you launched some fulcrum funds at AllianceBernstein. But to me, the story here is that you would lead with mutual funds in a new entity in 2019. Can you go deeper on that? PK: As I said before, ETFs are essentially derivatives. To put it differently, the ETF is a representation of a basket of securities that is publicly disclosed to the whole of the ETF. When you buy and sell the ETF, what happens is the underlying securities have to actually change hands. In order for these underlying securities to change hands, two authorized persons independent of the ETF literally have to buy and sell those securities. GS: For those that don’t understand the inner workings of ETFs, which is basically everyone on the planet, what is the importance of that distinction? PK: It is illogical to believe that someone can charge zero for a product, make no revenue and continue to offer that product forever. There is an underlying assumption that this liquidity or exchange process happens seamlessly at a very low cost to you, the holder of the ETF. When the markets are benign, that pretty much happens. But when markets become volatile, though, then the buyer and the seller of those underlying securities could be saying to themselves, “What’s the price of that security?” PK: Maybe I have to widen out the bid-ask spread, so now the cost is getting bigger. Maybe one of them says, “You might fail to deliver that security, so I’m not actually going to make a market in that security or I’m not going to accept that as a transaction.” One of the underlying themes of the past few years has been the increasing power — and therefore responsibility — of technology and the companies that harness it. More fundamentally though, how do we define tech ethics? What does it mean to be ethical when we are building products for the future? TechCrunch’s local humanist and ethicist Greg Epstein put together a roundtable with three leading scholars to discuss the meanings and contours of tech ethics today. Once you get past ethics, how do you actually create systems of compliance? We have two pieces on that front this week. First, startup attorney and founder Daniel McKenzie put together a comprehensive overview and checklist of all the regulatory matters required of startups in their first years of existence. This is a continuation of his Startup Law A-to-Z series that we have been running the past few weeks on Extra Crunch. Second, Lisa Hawke discusses the rise of dark data (data that isn’t visible to companies) and its implications for regulation and compliance. As data continues to flood into startups, how do you manage risks of data that you often cannot see? Hawke writes: What are some specific risks and challenges related to dark data? These can range from producing evidence in litigation (e.g. ediscovery) to a company’s ability to adhere to applicable regulations, such as data preservation and privacy laws. For example, GDPR presumes organizations know exactly what data they hold, making it important to understand if the company stores dark data (and where it is). It’s also important to consider security risk, which boils down to the fact that an organization can’t secure something if it doesn’t know about it at all (or where it is). Our media columnist Eric Peckham discussed the future of media with Northzone’s Pär-Jörgen Pärson. Northzone has become one of the leading media investors in Europe and around the world through their tenacious focus on the end user, and Pärson offers frank opinions on the state of affairs in the industry. Peckham: Were there things that you predicted would happen in media, say five years ago, that didn’t happen? Pärson: My hopes were too high that the established media houses would see the dangers of jumping into bed with Facebook and Google. [That they would see] they were being totally sacked and undermined by those companies. Instead, the response has been extremely shortsighted, not even tactical and definitely not strategic. I think they have even shortened their lifespan over the past five years. I thought that they would fight back in at least some sort of productive way. But they’re just laying down flat to die. Eric’s other passion besides media is education. He and I spent a good hour talking about the future of an increasingly popular new form of education financing known as the income share agreement. ISAs are being used by edtech startups like Lambda School in order to increase access to education while also improving incentives for the provider to offer a first-rate program. Eric: When you see people talk about this on Twitter they frame it as like venture capital or angel investing for individuals. And that’s not what it is. I mean, you could approach it from that perspective. But none of the programs out there that I’ve seen are doing that and most likely there will be regulation that prevents you from doing that. It’s pretty standard that these have a cap on the total amount of money that can be earned back – somewhere in the 1.5x to 2.5x range. It’s not about making money off one outlier student, it’s about investing in all the students who are part of a certain program – a class in a university or a software development boot camp. Within that portfolio, some students are financial losses and some of profitable, and by diversifying your risk you hope to net a stable return. The better the education program, the better market terms for ISAs. If you have made it down this far, you are a badass. Our final piece this week zoomed in on Snap’s announcement that it will start to prioritize gaming as part of its new engagement model. TechCrunch’s intrepid Asia reporter Jon Russell compared Snap’s new initiative to existing chatting apps in Asia, and finds some hope in the model: Social games won’t bring new users to Snap — blockbusters like Fortnite, PUBG or Apex Legends are what moves the market — but they might galvanize existing groups and increase engagement. Ultimately, it really depends on the quality of the titles. To every member of Extra Crunch: thank you.

    "content": "SpaceX has done it. Elon Musk’s rocket startup just successfully launched and then landed a Falcon 9 rocket some ten minutes later. This comes after several attempts that ended in fiery explosions. The rocket was carrying 11 satellites destined for low-Earth orbit. It’s important to note, this rocket isn’t a one-off affair, or a small rocket like the Blue Origin New Shepard or SpaceX Grasshopper. This Falcon 9 carried important cargo and landing the rocket booster was the secondary goal of the mission. The 15-story Falcon 9 is a serious rocket, capable of reaching 124 miles up thanks to the 1.5 million pounds of thrust produced by its 9 engines. It’s designed to take serious payloads into serious orbit. The Blue Origin is capable of taking a few humans 62 miles into the sky — which is still great. SpaceX previously attempted to land a Falcon 9 on a robotic barge. This time around, the company opted for terra firma and a massive concrete landing pad. Landing a Falcon 9 rocket was a long time coming for SpaceX. The company used smaller test rockets called the Grasshopper to test the system. Gradually, over several launches, the smaller rocket reached new heights from several hundred feet to sub-orbit flight before returning to Earth and landing vertically. The Falcon 9 is a two-stage rocket. Only the large, booster stage landed today. The remaining capsule contains the payload, which will not be reused. This was the sixth launch of a Falcon 9 rocket in 2015. Bring a +1 and save 60%Have a +1 you’d like to bring to Disrupt? Bring them along and save 60% on their pass.

    "content": "Meta has quietly reabsorbed the resources of its “Connectivity” division, the company confirmed. For nearly 10 years, this was the home of the former Facebook’s experimental internet and telecoms efforts, from satellites (exploded) to drones (crashed) to apps (disputed) and other more traditional infrastructure (appreciated and ongoing). As first noted by Light Reading, Meta Connectivity’s staff and projects, or what remain of them after the imminent cuts, will be divided between its Infrastructure and Central Products divisions. Exactly which resources and people will stay is no doubt a matter of some discussion even now, but the complete reduction of Connectivity suggests the more out-there approaches to providing internet are probably gone for good. The beginning of this division can probably be traced to attempts about ten years ago to subsidize internet connections in developing countries and regions. The Internet.org and Free Basics efforts would essentially provide Facebook and some bundled services free of charge to places where connectivity was expensive. This provoked a great deal of controversy at the time, from people incensed that a U.S. company thought it should step in to solve another’s problems, to the notion that the same company would essentially control access and content in violation of net neutrality policies, to others who saw the ostensibly charitable endeavor as Facebook buying global market share. In 2015 the company revealed plans for a completely unexpected high-altitude drone named Aquila, which would use lasers to connect people below it. This ambitious effort had a tough couple years, experiencing a rough landing in 2016 and eventually being permanently grounded in 2018. Meanwhile, they were going even higher than that with an early attempt at a low Earth orbit satellite connectivity system, which was scheduled for launch in September 2016. Unfortunately… A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket just exploded at Cape Canaveral, destroying Facebook’s Internet.org satellite Facebook didn’t give up, but it is worth noting that its next venture into satellite internet, a subsidiary called PointView Tech, had filed experimental FCC licensing documents in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021… but not this year. I reached out to check in but haven’t heard back. (Update: Looks like the satellite division was sold off to Amazon in 2021. That explains it…) But not everything the Connectivity division did flew in the air. As they probably had reiterated to them every time they talked about drones and lasers, what’s really needed is fiber backhaul and solid traditional wireless infrastructure so that neglected areas can connect just like everyone else in the world does. To that end, Meta has been working with the Telecom Infra Project to build new software, hardware and standards that make telecommunications networks more accessible and maintainable. Legacy industry dominates this space, so new entrants have a potentially large opportunity to make a change. Meta and Google, for instance, have invested in undersea cables and fiber that serve both their own purposes and public transport. That said, now that Connectivity is being broken up for parts, it’s impossible to say which efforts will continue to be pursued, funded, and so on. We’ll keep an eye out when the layoffs and consolidation conclude and see what’s left standing. Devin Coldewey is a Seattle-based writer and photographer. His personal website is coldewey.cc.

    "content": "Tesla Motors has been getting plenty of attention lately because of its heated back-and-forth with New York Times writer John Broder, but that only helped to drown out news concerning founder Elon Musk’s other transport-related venture. NASA announced earlier today that SpaceX’s Dragon capsule would be sent into low Earth orbit for a second supply run to the International Space Station on March 1. Things have been moving at a steady clip for SpaceX after it got over some very public growing pains early on (think a string of failed rocket tests), but a spate of recent successes have helped to change public perception of the starry-eyed venture. When the Dragon capsule (atop a Falcon 9 rocket) takes off from Cape Canaveral early next month, it’ll do so with over one ton of experiments and crew supplies in tow — I’m sure those astronauts will be glad to have something new to do. Granted, NASA’s announcement isn’t terribly groundbreaking — you can look back at the Dragon capsule’s first berthing to the ISS and its first resupply mission for more of a sense of historical achievement — but it paints a very positive portrait of SpaceX and its potential impact on space transport and exploration. After all, SpaceX’s ambitions aren’t just limited to shuttling cargo back and forth. The company aims to eventually ferry astronauts to and from the ISS, and has pointed to 2015 as a likely launch window for its first manned flight. Other, more seasoned players like Boeing are shooting to get manned flights of their own privately operated crew capsules going in a similar timeframe, but at this stage it seems entirely possible that the upstarts at SpaceX may be able to hit that milestone sooner — it’s planning an in-flight abort test (crucial for any flight involving human lives) for no later than April 2014, while Boeing doesn’t expect its CST-100 to venture into orbit until around 2016. And that’s to say nothing of founder Musk’s wild-eyed vision of sprawling Martian colonies packed to the air scrubbers with settlers from our world. As a child, the name “NASA” was enough to elicit gasps of delight and excitement — after all, these were the steely-eyed missile men who landed 12 people on the surface of the Moon and helped turn our eyes to the deepest corners of the heavens. Of course, the NASA of today isn’t quite the same for a number of reasons (consistent budget cuts being prime among them) and crazy private ventures like SpaceX seem best equipped to make these sorts of ambitious strides. Well, for now anyway — we’ll see if President Obama’s proclamation to raise tech R&D funding to a level “not seen since the start of the space race” manages to change the situation a little. Oh, and on a side note, NASA is also inviting 50 social media users to come and experience the launch proceedings up close — you can apply here, but know that I’ll forever jealous if you happen to make it down to the Cape.

    "content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted Wednesday that he will present the long-awaited and often teased Master Plan 3 during the company’s investor day March 1. Tesla’s investor day will be held at the company’s Gigafactory Texas located near Austin. The event will be livestreamed. Some of the company’s institutional and retail investors will be invited to attend in person, according to the company. Investors will be able to see its production line and discuss with its leadership team topics like the company’s long-term expansion plans, generation 3 platform and capital allocation, according to the company. Musk first hinted about the Master Plan 3 last March with vague goals to scale operations at Tesla to “extreme size.” He also leaned into themes like AI and noted that this next stage in the plan would include his other companies SpaceX and The Boring Company. Later in the year, Musk revealed more details about his Master Plan part three. Per a companywide meeting, the plan’s raison d’être is: “How do you get to enough scale to actually shift the entire energy infrastructure of earth?” The latest update came Wednesday. “Master Plan 3, the path to a fully sustainable energy future for Earth will be presented on March 1.” Master Plan 3, the path to a fully sustainable energy future for Earth will be presented on March 1. The future is bright! pic.twitter.com/11ug0LRlbD — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 8, 2023 For the unfamiliar, Musk posted a blog on Tesla’s website in 2006, outlining what he described as the Master Plan. That plan was four steps that kicked off with creating a low-volume expensive vehicle and then using that money to develop a medium-volume car at a lower price. Profits from the medium-volume car would be used to create an affordable, high-volume car. And finally, the plan ended with “provide solar power.” Some quibble with the success of the Master Plan, pointing out that Tesla didn’t use profits to fund the Model 3 (it was unprofitable at the time) and that its high-volume car is not affordable. But Tesla did produce the Roadster, and then the Model S and X (the medium-volume car) and finally the Model 3, which may still cost more than $50,000 but has proven to be a high-volume seller. Part two, or Part Deux as it is named, came in 2016 with a plan to”create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage,” expand Tesla’s EV product line to address all major segments and develop self-driving capability that is 10x safer than manual. Finally, the plan promised owners would be able to leverage that self-driving into ridesharing so they could make money on their car when they’re not using it. Tesla has not ticked all the boxes in Part Deux. The Cybertruck, which presumably is part of the plan to expand the EV product line, has yet to launch, its advanced driver assistance system despite the branding is not self driving and, as a result, owners cannot turn their vehicles into robotaxis that generate money. It seems that Musk is ready to move on to Part 3 anyway. Bring a +1 and save 60%Have a +1 you’d like to bring to Disrupt? Bring them along and save 60% on their pass.

Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B. A few items before jumping in. Policy corner is going on hiatus for a bit. A message from reporter Aria Alamalhodaei: “For the time being, your favorite mini-roundup of transportation policy news will be taking an extended hiatus. I hope to be back with you in the second quarter of 2022! If you have tips or policy news you want to share, send it over to Kirsten or Rebecca. See you next year!” Secondly, I (that’s me Kirsten) am taking a bit of holiday time and will see you next year! Wishing all my readers a happy holiday and good health in the coming year. The transportation world lost one of its leaders this week. Ryan Popple, a former active duty Army officer and early member of Tesla’s finance team who rose through the ranks before leaving to become a partner at Kleiner Perkins and CEO of electric bus manufacturer Proterra, died unexpectedly at 44 years old. He is survived by a wife and three children. Popple had recently left Proterra and had joined G2 Venture Partners. As G2 Venture Partners wrote in its remembrance of Popple: “Ryan embodied entrepreneurial spirit and devoted his life to creating a better future. His leadership at Proterra was first and foremost about increasing access to affordable, sustainable solutions and shaping a zero-emission transportation future for the benefit of our planet and the health of our communities. His work as a partner at and Kleiner Perkins was dedicated to leading the sustainable transformation of industries. A former active duty officer in the U.S. Army, Ryan put country before self in uniform, and in civilian life.” I first interviewed Ryan back in 2016. During that interview and the few times we spoke since then, I was always struck with the particular combination of passion and practicality that he brought to every conversation. Ryan, you will be missed. Finally, Hazel Chapman, the co-founder of Lotus Cars and former British racing driver, died earlier this week at the age of 94. As always, you can email me at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com to share thoughts, criticisms, opinions or tips. You also can send a direct message to me at Twitter — @kirstenkorosec Welcome folks, let’s get right to it. Tier, a Berlin-based micromobilty operator that just keeps growing, has acquired Wind Mobility’s Italian operations. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but this is Tier’s second company purchase of late, and Wind’s second sale, as well. Wind also sold off its Israeli operations to Yandex, the Russian tech giant, a few months ago. By the way, Tier also just released some stats about its London trial. Since the trial started in June, Tier scooters have seen more than 218,000 miles of trips on the road. Zoomo, the Australian e-bike subscription platform for enterprise and gig economy delivery workers, has come out with a new utility e-bike, the Zoomo One, that it’s hoping will take the place of the humble moped. It can handle payloads of 88 lbs in the back and 40 lbs in the front, and can handle deliveries no matter the weather or terrain, according to the company. Unagi, the e-scooter manufacturer, has announced the nationwide expansion of its all-access subscription plan, which allows subscribers to pay-as-you-go on a monthly plan for about $50 a month, or pay for an annual plan of $39 per month. No commitments, no cancel fees, no worries. Gogoro launched a new urban battery swapping initiative that uses Gogoro-powered smart parking meters, co-developed with Shengming Technology. The company says the meters will provide cities with smart city tech that fast-track the deployment of wireless connectivity and off-grid power for a range of users, including parking management. The meters are currently being deployed in New Taipei City, Taiwan, and will be operational in early 2022, with an additional 6,000 meters rolling out across the country by the end of the year. Harley-Davidson announced that it’s taking electric motorcycle division LiveWire public through a merger with a blank check company sponsored by executives of AEA Investors and Bridges Fund Management. First the details: The agreement is with special purpose acquisition company AEA-Bridges Impact Corp (ABIC). The deal is funded by $400 million that ABIC is holding in trust, a $100 million investment from Harley-Davidson and $100 million from Kymco. Harley-Davidson will own about 74% of the newly combined company. The SPAC shareholders will have a 17% ownership, with the remaining 4% being held by SPAC founders and Kymco. The combined company is expected to have an enterprise value of about $1.77 billion and post-money equity value of about $2.31 billion at closing. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2022. What does this all mean? The deal will preserve much of Harley-Davidson’s ownership while giving LiveWire access to the capital that the public markets can provide — and fold in Kymco as a key partner. My prediction: If 2020 and 2021 were the years of the SPAC, 2022 will be the year of the public spin-out. Watch for more legacy companies to follow Harley-Davidson’s LiveWire spin-out strategy. Other deals that got my attention this week … Apex.ai, a mobility software startup founded by Bosch veterans and automated systems engineers Jan Becker and Dejan Pangercic, raised a Series B $56.5 million round led by Orillion. AGCO, Canaan, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Airbus Ventures, Jaguar Land Rover’s InMotion Ventures, Continental and ZF also participated. Apex has raised a total of $74 million to date, a figure that includes previously announced investments from Volvo Group Venture Capital, Toyota Ventures and HELLA Ventures. ZF is taking a 5% stake in Apex. Gopuff is in the process of raising $1.5 billion, with a valuation of up to $40 billion. Solvento, a platform that provides trucking companies with immediate access to capital, raised $4.5 million in funding led by Dynamo Ventures with participation from Wollef Ventures and Zenda Capital. The funding includes a $3 million debt facility from Marco Financial. Vay, a company that is trying to get self-driving car services to market faster by pursuing a teledriven approach, has raised a $95 million Series B round to help it launch its first commercial service in Hamburg, Germany sometime in 2022. Vertical Aerospace, an aerospace and technology company, started trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker EVTL. Voly, a five-month-old Sydney-based startup that offers thousands of SKUs and promises deliveries in 15 minutes at a flat fee of AUS$2.99 ($2.14), has raised AUS$18 million (just under $13 million at today’s rates) in a seed round of funding that it will be using to expand its business to cities and towns across the country. WeRide, the Chinese autonomous vehicle technology company, received a strategic investment from Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC Group). The companies did not disclose the terms. It was a crazy week in the world of autonomous vehicles! Aurora’s self-driving trucks are hauling goods for Uber Freight customers in Texas as part of a multiphase commercial pilot that aims to more closely integrate the two companies. Aurora is using the Uber Freight brokerage platform, which connects truck drivers with shippers that need cargo delivered, to haul freight for customers between Dallas and Houston. Aurora said it will expand routes as it adds more terminals. Einride, an electric and autonomous freight company from Sweden, launched its debut NFT, the first-ever sketch of its autonomous Pod, as its first foray into the crypto space. It will be the first in a series of NFTs to be released by the company, it says, and will be the catalyst for Einride to tap into the web3 world. Because every freight company needs a space in the metaverse. GM issued a terse and unexpected statement this week that Cruise CEO Dan Ammann was leaving the company. There was no shortage of tips, rumors and speculation sent my way in the few hours after the announcement about why Ammann left. I have not confirmed any of them. I did speak with a few folks who had direct knowledge of how it played at over at Cruise HQ. The most common words were “chaotic,” “hasty” and a “surprise.” Separately, Lucas Watson, Cruise’s senior vice president of go-to-market, left the company last week. I’m told this is unrelated. However, it doesn’t change the fact that two key people focused on the business strategy at Cruise are now gone. Mobileye said it has added Paris to its autonomous vehicle testing program. The company said it will be working with French public transport provider RATP to provide an AV on-demand service for employees of the shopping center Galleries Lafayette Paris Hausmann. Motional is partnering with Uber to launch an autonomous delivery pilot in Santa Monica. Uber Eats customers will be able to order restaurant meal kits to be delivered to them via one of Motional’s retrofitted all-electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 robotaxis by early next year. Pony.ai, a Chinese autonomous driving startup with an office in the U.S., has paused its driverless pilot fleet in California six months after it was approved by local regulators to test autonomous vehicles without a human safety driver. The California Department of Motor Vehicles, the agency that regulates AVs in the state, suspended Pony’s driverless testing permit following a reported collision in Fremont on October 28, the DMV told TechCrunch in a statement. TuSimple reached a deal to integrate its autonomous vehicle technology into DHL Supply Chain’s operations. As part of the deal, the contract logistics giant has reserved 100 autonomous trucks that are being co-developed by TuSimple and Navistar. The agreement with DHL pushes TuSimple’s total reservations order to 6,875 trucks, the first of which will be delivered in 2024. TuSimple disclosed that is it already using its self-driving trucks to haul freight daily for DHL on a San Antonio-to-Dallas route. A Waymo self-driving Jaguar I-Pace that struck a pedestrian in San Francisco was in manual mode, the company told TechCrunch in response to an initial report posted on Reddit. Abigail Bassett gives her first impressions of the 2022 Porsche Taycan GTS Sport Turismo. Ample co-founder John de Souza is our last founder Q&A of the year. Canoo is ending its deal with Dutch automotive manufacturing company VDL Nedcar to serve as its contract manufacturer in Europe and instead is exploring a new deal with VDL Groep, another Dutch auto manufacturing company, to produce vehicles in the United States. Lightyear, a company developing a long distance solar car, signed an agreement with car-as-a-service company LeasePlan to reserve 5,000 of Lightyear’s second model to offer on its platform by 2025. Kia said its new EV6 has an estimated EPA range of 310 miles when equipped with a 77.4 kWh battery and rear-wheel drive. The EV6 goes on sale in the first quarter of 2022. GM executive Pamela Fletcher, an engineer who launched the Chevrolet Bolt and who more recently was vice president of the company’s global innovation team, left the company to become an executive with Delta Air Lines. Nio, the Chinese electric car company, debuted the ET5, a “smart” mid-sized sedan that it says has between 550 kilometers and 1,000 kilometers of range depending on the battery pack size. The interior has a panoramic digital cockpit it calls Panocinema that features AR and VR tech; notably, there are custom augmented reality glasses developed through a partnership with Nreal that can project a 201-inch screen out six meters in front of drivers. Proterra, the U.S. commercial electric vehicle company that produces transit buses and electric charging systems, is opening its third battery factory in Greer, South Carolina. The factory should begin production in the second half of 2022 with “multiple gigawatt hours of annual battery system production capacity,” according to the company. Rivian had its first earnings report as a publicly traded company. The big news: Rivian is expanding production capacity of its Normal, Illinois factory from 150,000 to 200,000 electric vehicles a year and building a second factory east of Atlanta that will have a targeted annual production capacity of 400,000 vehicles a year. This Georgia factory will include a co-located battery cell production facility. Construction will begin in summer 2022 with production beginning in 2024. Speaking of Rivian, reporter Mark Harris looked into one of Rivian’s earliest backers: Space Florida. Toyota laid out its EV plans — a target of introducing 30 battery electric vehicles by 2030 and for total global battery electric vehicle sales to reach 3.5 million within the same time frame. The company also aims to turn Lexus into an all-electric brand by the end of the decade. And amid its media reveal managed to squeeze in the time to rickroll us.

Another week, another batch of transportation news. And as always, senior reporter Sean O’Kane is deep in the Fisker beat. Fisker has a little something to celebrate this week as it winds its way through Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Despite one major objector, a judge has approved the sale of more than 3,000 Fisker Ocean SUVs to a vehicle leasing company, a deal that will net the defunct EV startup a maximum of $46.25 million. The proceedings still have a ways to go and a few remaining hurdles, which O’Kane lays out in detail in this story. Of course, there was so much more that happened this week. Let’s get to it. Got a tip for us? Email Kirsten Korosec at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com, Sean O’Kane at sean.okane@techcrunch.com or Rebecca Bellan at rebecca.bellan@techcrunch.com. Or check out these instructions to learn how to contact us via encrypted messaging apps or SecureDrop. This deal should be described as the great unwinding. I’m talking about Yandex NV — the Netherlands-based company that recently sold off its Russian business and has been renamed Nebius Group. You might recall that Yandex NV, which owned the Russian search engine giant, came under scrutiny and sanctions after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The company reached an agreement earlier this year to sell its Russian business for about $5.2 billion to a consortium of Russian buyers. The deal officially wrapped up this week. Why do we care about this over here at TechCrunch Mobility? Nebius is using the proceeds of the sale to develop four projects, which include Avride, an autonomous vehicle technology company. Yandex has worked on autonomous driving technology for years; I even tested out their tech at CES several years ago. And some of you may have encountered its delivery robots, which use the same underlying technology, on college campuses. I spent some time talking to the folks at Avride, including Artem Fokin, who heads up business development there. Keep an eye out for my longer article on this company. In the meantime, I’ll leave you with a few teasers. Avride has picked Austin, Texas, for its headquarters, where the bulk of its 270 employees will eventually be located. The startup does have global operations, however, with offices in Tel Aviv, Belgrade and Seoul. Avride is currently testing its technology in Austin and Seoul. Other deals that got my attention … Hayden AI Technologies, a startup that uses AI-powered camera systems to help cities detect and enforce parking and moving violations, raised $90 million in a Series C round led by The Rise Fund. Existing investors such as the Drawdown Fund and Autotech Ventures also participated. Huture, a Chinese hydrogen energy company, will go public in the U.S. via a merger with blank-check firm Aquaron Acquisition Corp. The combined company would be valued at $1 billion. Moving Tech, the Bengaluru-based parent firm of Indian open source ride-sharing app Namma Yatri, raised $11 million in a pre-Series A funding round co-led by Blume Ventures and Antler. Google also participated in the round. Northbound, a German startup that has developed software for global shipping logistics, raised €1.3 million ($1.42 million) in a pre-seed round led by Apex Black. Investors id4 ventures, IBB Ventures, Schenker Ventures and MVP Factory also participated. Tekion Corp., a California-based startup founded in 2016 that developed software for automotive retailers and manufacturers, raised $200 million from Dragoneer Investment Group that pushes its valuation above $4 billion. UP.Partners, the Santa Monica-based VC firm that focuses on mobility startups, is aiming to raise $230 million for its second fund, per an SEC filing and reporting by Axios. Aurora co-founder Sterling Anderson recently sat down with George Gianarikas, the sustainable and autonomous driving analyst at Canaccord Genuity, for a discussion on different approaches to driverless vehicles. It’s worth listening to Anderson’s thoughts on end-to-end AI — the approach that Tesla purports to use — and whether it can be safely applied to autonomous vehicles. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has confirmed earlier reports the company is delaying its robotaxi reveal, explaining it was because he requested an “important design change to the front.” We’re still wanting for more details, including exactly when this robotaxi event will be held. Remember those Waymo robotaxis that were vandalized? A Castro Valley resident was charged for allegedly slashing the tires of 17 Waymo robotaxis in San Francisco. Exterior cameras on the robotaxi caught the footage and helped police identify the suspect. In other Waymo news, Automotive News dug into how the Alphabet-owned company uses AI to enhance self-driving vehicle skills. TechCrunch contributor Tim Stevens found an interesting EV startup called Helixx at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. Check out this interview with Helixx co-founder and CEO Steve Pegg to learn about the startup’s “factory-in-a-box” strategy and its 3D-printed prototype delivery van. As Stevens notes, Helixx’s pitch is less about an endearingly boxy little van designed to cost just $6,000 and more about rebooting everything we know about building cars. VanMoof, the e-bike startup that declared bankruptcy last year, is back with new owners and a pitch to the 5,000 customers who had pre-ordered e-bikes and were left in the lurch. Can VanMoof woo them back? Senior reporter Rebecca Bellan gives us the skinny. Archer Aviation and Southwest Airlines announced a partnership that will focus on figuring out what it will take to build out a network of electric air taxis at California airports. As senior reporter Rebecca Bellan discovered, Southwest’s customer data is at the heart of it. I wasn’t super impressed last year when I got into the Nissan Ariya, largely because I had elevated expectations and felt that the price point was too high. After all, Nissan brought us the Leaf; the Ariya should have been a slam dunk that incorporated all of the lessons Nissan had learned from the Leaf and its customers. I recently spent more time in the all-electric SUV; this time it was the 2024 Nissan Ariya Empower+, a front-wheel-drive trim with two-tone Boulder Gray and Super Black paint that gets about 289 miles of range and has a base price of $47,690. (The base price doesn’t include destination fees or taxes.) Not much has changed between 2023 and 2024 model years. However, Nissan has lowered the price of the Nissan Ariya and its numerous trim levels, which solves one of my primary complaints. The Ariya interior, including the dashboard, has a modern and clean look that is a clear upgrade from its Leaf predecessor. It feels spacious in the front thanks to the flat floor and moving center console. And the seats are nice to look at and, importantly, comfortable to sit in. I appreciate that the HVAC controls have their own separate area below the 12.3-inch touchscreen. However, haptic feedback controls weren’t as engaging as I would like; oftentimes, I would end up hitting a button multiple times before getting the action I wanted. I’m also not a huge fan of the gear selector, but I did adapt after a few outings. The Nissan Ariya Empower+ — the top trim in front-wheel drive — comes with an 87 kWh battery and a single motor. The powertrain delivers 238 horsepower and 221 pound-feet of torque. On the road, that translates to a vehicle that offers a low-key, comfortable and balanced ride. And that’s fine for customers who aren’t looking for off-the-line punchiness and performance-like handling (to be clear, the upper all-wheel-drive trims are faster). Nissan didn’t make any notable changes to the software in the 2024 Ariya. I had hoped for more improvements on that front, including the ability to set the state of charge via the central screen. Right now, customers must turn to the My Nissan app to set the state of charge. Bring a +1 and save 60%Have a +1 you’d like to bring to Disrupt? Bring them along and save 60% on their pass.

Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B. Before we jump in, I wanted to note that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration posted what appears to be the first crash involving a Tesla that had the FSD beta software engaged. As always, Tesla vehicles equipped with full self-driving (FSD) software are not self-driving. What does this mean? Well, my expectation is that there will be more incidents like this and as a result NHTSA will be forced to act. I’ll be out in Los Angeles this coming week for a number of events, including CoMotion and the Los Angeles Auto Show. Stay tuned for our coverage throughout the week. As always, you can email me at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com to share thoughts, criticisms, opinions or tips. You also can send a direct message to me at Twitter — @kirstenkorosec. Wheels, the shared micromobility operator with distinctive sit-down scooters, has partnered with UMass Boston, and soon, with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. Free Now, the mobility app backed by BMW and Daimler, has officially integrated with Dott, allowing customers to book Dott’s e-scooters on the app, and eventually, its e-bikes, too. The partnership will be available in the U.K., France, Italy, Poland and Germany, with more countries expected to follow. Bird riders surveyed in Atlanta show that nearly half of all riders identify as female, which is a promising stat if we’re trying to close the gender gap in the micromobility world. In the same survey, 65% of respondents said protected bike lanes would encourage them to use more scooters. In other Bird news, the company is launching its public bikeshare integration with MoGo in Detroit, a docked bikeshare service. Bird will now feature MoGo bikes in its app. Tier is bringing 500 e-bikes to the London Borough of Islington, boosting green transport options following the Ultra Low Emissions Zone expansion. The company has also just added 10 new all-electric MAN eTGE vans in London. The vans will be used to service Tier’s e-scooter fleet. Cabify has added a new business line to its multimodal repertoire. The company is partnering with Velca, a Spanish e-motorcycle brand, to provide users in Barcelona, Malaga, Madrid, Sevilla and Valencia with monthly rentals of electric motorcycles. Back in July, BMW announced it would finally start producing its retro-futuristic CE 04 electric motorbike, a vehicle around which it has released multiple concepts. Now, the automaker has entered into full series production. Propella, the e-bike manufacturer, introduced its Propella Mini bike, its smallest and lightest model yet. Coming in at just 33 pounds and 59 inches long, the Mini has 20-inch wheels, a small frame and low-power electronics. It’s equipped with a 400W Bafang motor, which is good for mainly flat land riding. It can handle a slope of about 10% grade. Anyone buying an e-bike or e-scooter, should be taking precautions, say fire departments and safety officials, after an increase in battery fires linked to micromobility devices. The New York Fire Department reported 78 fires linked to e-bikes this year and their lithium-ion batteries that can get overheated and catch fire if they’re not charged or disposed of properly. The Rivian IPO wasn’t just the deal of the week. I’m dubbing it deal of the year. We all knew it was going to be big. Rivian’s IPO has been highly anticipated. Still, the reaction and willingness of investors to buy shares 37% higher than the listed price is simply bananas. Rivian shares were listed at $78 and its opening trade was $106.75. The company has a trickle of revenue and mounting losses due to the expense of ramping up production of its R1T and R1S vehicles and RCV, the electric commercial vans it is supplying to Amazon and maybe others. That didn’t stop people from piling in and helping push Rivian’s value past $110 billion. (Closing share price on Friday was $129.95.) Rivian now has a market cap beyond GM and Ford, two legacy automakers that actually produce and sell millions of vehicles each year. Those niggling details like revenue didn’t dampen the mood. Even Amazon, which already held a 20% stake in the company, bought even more shares, per a Friday afternoon regulatory filing. Amazon now owns a total of 158,363,834 shares of Rivian, or about 22%. We miscalculated what portion of Rivian’s stock Amazon owns. If you look at the ecommerce giant’s most recent share tally, and compare it to Rivian’s expected post-IPO share count (inclusive of its underwriters’ option), it works out to 17.7%. However, if you calculate from Yahoo Finance’s listed share count for Rivian today, Amazon owns a slimmer 16.2% stake. Both figures are material, if more modest. There’s been speculation about whether Ford, which owns about 12% of Rivian, will cash out. The automaker has made a hefty return on its investment already. Ford has made about $820 million in equity and bond investments in Rivian. Those shares, about 102 million according to filings, are now worth $13.15 billion. What comes next? You better believe the attention on Rivian will be intense as it tries to meet production and delivery targets on the commercial delivery van for Amazon and its consumer products. Rivian is supposed to deliver the first 10 vans (out of an order of 100,000) to Amazon in December. When there is a customer like Amazon to please, that deadline might be difficult to keep. I’ll be watching. Other deals that got my attention this week … Ample, a startup developing battery swapping technology for electric vehicles, raised $30 million from The Blackstone Group and Spanish multinational financial services company Banco Santander. Applied Intuition, a company that sells software development tools to automotive engineers, has raised $175 million in a round led by Addition Capital, Coatue Management and serial entrepreneur Elad Gil, Bloomberg reported. The Mountain View, California-based company has a post-funding valuation of $3.6 billion. Blackshark.ai, the Austrian mapping startup, raised a $20 million Series A to develop and scale its replica-Earth tech. The potential applications for a planetary “digital twin” are many and various, and the company has a head start even on mapping giants like Google, TechCrunch’s Devin Coldewey wrote. DoorDash, the on-demand delivery giant, acquired food delivery company Wolt in an all-stock deal valued at €7 billion, or $8.1 billion. Embark Trucks, an autonomous vehicle company completed its SPAC merger and began trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker EMBK. CNBC profiled its 26-year-old founder and CEO Alex Rodrigues. Gett, the ride-hailing company, reached a deal to merge with special purpose acquisition company Rosecliff Acquisition Corp. I, a SPAC backed by the investment firm Rosecliff Venture Management LLC, the WSJ reported. GoTo Group, the Indonesia-based startup born out of a merger in May between ride-hailing giant Gojek and e-commerce company Tokopedia, secured more than $1.3 billion in the first close of its pre-IPO funding. The round was led by Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, with participation from Avanda Investment Management, Fidelity International, Google, Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB), Primavera Capital, SeaTown Master Fund, Temasek, Tencent and Ward Ferry. Inspiration, a startup that finances commercial electric vehicle operations and has plans to build, own and operate the corresponding charging infrastructure, came out of stealth with an initial $200 million in investment. The funding comes from ArcLight Capital Partners, a venture fund that invests in energy infrastructure. Kodiak Robotics, one of the last privately held autonomous truck outfits in Silicon Valley, raised $125 million in new capital. Notably, the lead investor is not listed and not being disclosed. I was told that a freight and logistics company set up a special interest financial vehicle as the strategic lead investor spot in the round. Other investors include newcomers SIP Global Partners, Muirwoods Ventures, Harpoon Ventures, StepStone Group, Gopher Asset Management, Walleye Capital, Aliya Capital Partners and others. Existing investors Battery Ventures, CRV and Lightspeed Venture Partners also participated. Bridgestone Americas and BMW i Ventures, which had announced strategic investments in Kodiak earlier this year, converted its funds to this round. Lordstown Motors sold its 6.2-million-square-foot Lordstown, Ohio factory to Foxconn, the Taiwanese hardware manufacturing company best known for making Apple’s iPhone. The $230 million deal is expected to close by the end of April next year, according to a statement from Lordstown. Plus and Hennessy Capital Investment Corp., a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company, agreed to terminate their previously announced merger. The companies said this was “in light of recent developments in the regulatory environment outside of the United States.” Plus, an autonomous vehicle company, said it is pursuing a potential restructuring of certain aspects of its business. Importantly, Plus’ deal to supply Amazon with driver-assistant technology remains intact, Automotive News reported. Point One Navigation, a startup that combines augmented global navigation satellite system, computer vision and sensor fusion into an API to provide precise location for robotics, OEMs and AV developers, raised $10 million. The Series A round was led by UP.Partners, with participation from existing investors including BOLT, IA Ventures and Ludlow Ventures. RabbitMart, or Rabbit for short, came out of stealth with $11 million in pre-seed funding amid a booming fast-delivery market in Africa. San Francisco-based Global Founders Capital, Raed Ventures, Foundation Venture, MSA Capital and Goodwater Capital participated in this pre-seed round. TriEye, the Israeli sensing startup, raised $74 million in a round led by M&G Investments and Varana Capital, with the participation of Samsung Ventures, Tawazun SDF, Deep Insight, Allied Group and Discount Capital, as well as existing investors Intel Capital, Porsche Ventures, Marius Nacht and Grove Ventures. The round brings TriEye’s total funding to $96 million. Upstream Security, the automotive cybersecurity technology company, received an undisclosed investment from BMW i Ventures. United States Postal Service narrowed its net losses by about half. The company reported a net loss of $4.9 billion for the 2021 budget year, an improvement over last year’s losses of $9.17 billion. Zoomcar, the Bangalore-based car-sharing startup, raised $92 million in a new financing round led by SternAegis Ventures. Zoomcar has raised $207 million to date. I hear things, but I’m not selfish. Let me share. Three quick items this week that are all about executive shuffling in the autonomous vehicle industry. You might remember that Anthony Foxx, the Secretary of Transportation under President Barack Obama, joined Lyft as chief policy officer and senior adviser back in 2018. Foxx is stepping down from the CPO gig, I learned recently. The new CPO will be Jeremy Bird, who is taking over in January. Bird joined Lyft in 2019 and was promoted to deputy CPO nearly a year ago. Lyft did confirm this tidbit to me and said Foxx will stay on as a senior adviser. Here’s a statement from Foxx that was sent me: It’s the right time for me. I worked hard to build the absolute best policy team in business. There’s really no other team like us. That’s really what I came to do, and I could not be more proud of our people or have more confidence in Lyft going forward. I can now feel good about transitioning the team while continuing to advise Lyft. Jeremy has been an instrumental part of this team and is a great leader in his own right. I’m thrilled to pass the torch to him. Another departure that actually occurred months ago, but no one has reported on, is over at Kodiak Robotics. In 2018, Kodiak came out of stealth with $40 million in funding and an intriguing founder lineup. One co-founder was Don Burnette, who is CEO and a veteran of the autonomous vehicle industry. Burnette left the Google self-driving project to co-found self-driving truck startup Otto in early 2016, along with Anthony Levandowski, Lior Ron and Claire Delaunay. He left in March 2018, about a year after Uber bought Otto. The other co-founder was Paz Eshel, former venture capitalist. Specifically, he had been a vice president at Battery Ventures, where he led the firm’s autonomous-vehicle investment project. Battery Ventures led Kodiak’s first round and Itzik Parnafes, a general partner at Battery Ventures, joined the Kodiak board. I learned, and Burnette confirmed, that Eshel is no longer at the company. Burnette wouldn’t provide further details except to say that he departed earlier this summer. I reached out, but have not heard from Eshel. And finally, it seems that Gretchen Effgen, a longtime executive at Motional, is now at Google. Effgen led partnerships and marketing at nuTonomy, the autonomous vehicle startup that was acquired by Aptiv in November 2018. This venture was spun out in 2020 as Motional, a $4 billion joint venture with Hyundai. Effgen joined Google as it director of global automotive partnerships, platforms and ecosystems this month, according to her LinkedIn profile. Hello everyone! Welcome back to Policy Corner. I want to touch briefly on the news regarding the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill passed by Congress last Friday — briefly because, well, there’s tons already out there detailing in full what it includes and doesn’t include, what it means for roads, ports and the railway system. Regarding transportation electrification, the big wins include: There are a few other interesting tidbits included in the bill that caught my eye as well, especially an “Advanced Impaired Driving Technology” provision. Essentially, this provision gives the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration three years to evaluate anti-drunk driving auto tech and issue a new safety standard, which automakers will be required to incorporate into new vehicles two years after that. NHTSA will no doubt be evaluating driver monitoring tech, including sensors outside the vehicle and even in-vehicle sensors that actually monitor the driver’s eyes and attention. It looks like many technologies that are already rolling out in vehicles today, like lane departure warnings, could be used for this purpose, and other companies are already starting to look into how their systems could be used to prevent drunk driving. Also of note: NHTSA will receive around $110 million per year to conduct “behavioral research on Automated Systems and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and improving consumer responses to safety recalls.” Another bill was passed this week that could mean big things for everything from drones to eVTOL. That is the Advanced Air Mobility Coordination and Leadership Act, which will establish an interagency working group within the Department of Transportation to “plan and coordinate efforts related to the safety, operations, infrastructure, physical security, cybersecurity, and Federal investment necessary for maturation of the AAM ecosystem” in the U.S. This is a big deal! This goes far beyond the Federal Aviation Administration’s authority to certify aircraft, which is really one piece of the puzzle to launching AAM technologies. This working group will make recommendations for all the other pieces in which the federal government plays a role, like safety requirements of future air traffic management systems; infrastructure, including utility infrastructure, to support the growth of AAM; and community acceptance of the tech. “Congress spending intentional time looking at infrastructure, looking at operations, looking at how all of these things can come to fruition and really benefit states in the communities that each of these senators and representatives serve is pretty big,” Ian Villa, COO of Whisper Aero, told TechCrunch in a recent interview. The working group’s recommendations will also likely push conformity — which is good for end users and industry, Villa added. “There’s no way we can stand up a real system if the way that air taxis operate in Miami is different than the way [they] operate in California.” The working group will be required to submit a report to Congress on their findings. Gatik, an autonomous delivery startup focused on the middle mile, pulled the safety operator from behind the wheel of two self-driving box trucks that operate in Walmart’s home turf of Bentonville, Arkansas. This means the startup’s box trucks are driverless on a commercial route. TechCrunch actually reported about this in August, when the company first went fully driverless. Gatik revealed more details on this milestone, including that it has a chase vehicle for now. Lyft and Motional will launch their first fully driverless ride-hail service in Las Vegas in 2023. The companies aim to be transporting public passengers — via Motional’s electric Hyundai IONIQ 5-based robotaxis and booked through the Lyft app — by the second half of next year. They will eventually scale up to a full commercial launch when Lyft is allowed to charge for rides in 2023. Nvidia said that Hyperion 8 — a production-ready platform that includes sensors, compute and software needed for AV development — is now available to buy for 2024 vehicle models. Hyperion 8 is the latest iteration of the end-to-end Nvidia Drive platform that automakers can use to customize to their likening and needs. This was revealed back in April. However, some details, including which companies are supplying the 12 cameras, nine radars and one lidar that are part of the platform, weren’t shared until this past week. Notably, Luminar is supplying the lidar, a potential boon for the newly public company. Continental, Hella, Sony and Valeo are also supplying sensors to Nvidia for the Hyperion 8. Plus, the autonomous vehicle company I cited up in the “deal of the week” section, announced a partnership with Aeva lidar. Aeva’s tech will be used in Plus’s first 100,000 trucks. Ouster, a lidar company, held its Q3 earnings call last week. Ouster said it is spending more on R&D and scaling up a division focused just on automotive, another signal that lidar companies have to diversify their offerings to stay afloat. GreenPower and Perrone Robotics are teaming up to produce the AV Star. It’s a combination of GreenPower’s EV star, a mini electric bus, that will be fitted with Perrone’s TONY autonomous vehicle retrofit kit. Workhorse Group, the troubled electric vehicle startup, is struggling — and beyond its Q3 $81 million loss. Revenue is also in the negative to the tune of $576,600 because it had to issue refunds to customers who had their C-1000 cargo delivery vans recalled due to safety issues. Workhorse CEO Rick Dauch also admitted that, aside from federal safety issues, the C-1000 just might not be up to the task of heavy duty deliveries. Yikes. The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against ride-hailing giant Uber over claims that the company discriminates against passengers with disabilities, in violation of the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act. Dr. Lawrence Burns, an author and former corporate VP of research & development and planning at General Motors, is now an executive adviser of autonomous sensing platforms company Neural Propulsion Systems. Burns was a former adviser to Waymo. MotoRefi, the auto refinance platform, changed its name to Caribou. Along with the new branding and logo, Caribou recently combined its auto financing product with insurance. The company said it plans to announce specific details on insurance carrier plans in early 2022. Bring a +1 and save 60%Have a +1 you’d like to bring to Disrupt?

    "content": "Tesla Investor Day is upon us, an occasion where shareholders and superfans will make their pilgrimage to the company’s Gigafactory Texas, located near Austin — while the rest of us tune in via livestream on YouTube or Twitter — to hear exactly what CEO Elon Musk has planned for the future. Tesla Investor Day is scheduled to begin at 4:00 p.m. ET, or for those on the ground in Austin, 3:00 p.m. CT. Historically, that doesn’t mean Musk will be onstage at the top of the hour. But hey, ya never know! Earlier this year, Musk tweeted that he would present the long-awaited and often teased Master Plan 3 during the company’s investor day, which will be held at the company’s Gigafactory Texas. Those who attend in person will be able to see its production line and discuss with its leadership team topics like the company’s long-term expansion plans, generation 3 platform and capital allocation, according to the company. What will Musk announce? Get out your bingo cards. TechCrunch has a few theories and wishes. Musk first hinted about the Master Plan 3 last March with vague goals to scale operations at Tesla to “extreme size.” He also leaned into themes like AI and noted that this next stage in the plan would include his other companies SpaceX and The Boring Company. Later in the year, Musk revealed more details about his Master Plan 3. Per a companywide meeting, the plan’s raison d’être is: “How do you get to enough scale to actually shift the entire energy infrastructure of earth?” Musk will likely discuss plans to build a new factory in Mexico, which the nation’s president confirmed publicly yesterday. Musk may also hint at or even show off a prototype of a new EV, because showing new, future products is like catnip for investors. We’d like updates on existing products, like the status of the Cybertruck, the robot (remember that?) and plans for the branded “Full Self Driving” (FSD) software beta that recently was recalled after federal safety regulators warned the system could allow vehicles to act unsafely. Tesla has since postponed rolling out any more installations of FSD to customers until it issues a software update that fixes the problem. For those wondering, what the heck is Master Plan 3? Is there a Master Plan 1? Yes, indeedy. Musk posted a blog on Tesla’s website in 2006, outlining what he described as the Master Plan. That four-step plan began with creating a low-volume expensive vehicle and then using that money to develop a medium-volume car at a lower price. Profits from the medium-volume car would be used to create an affordable, high-volume car. And finally, the plan ended with “provide solar power.” Many have noted that the Master Plan didn’t exactly go as planned. Tesla didn’t use profits to fund the Model 3 (it was unprofitable at the time) and its high-volume car is not affordable. But Tesla did produce the Roadster, and then the Model S and X (the medium-volume car) and finally the Model 3, which may still cost more than $40,000 but has proven to be a high-volume seller. Part two, or Part Deux as it is named, came in 2016 with a plan to “create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage,” expand Tesla’s EV product line to address all major segments and develop self-driving capability that is 10x safer than manual driving. The plan also promised owners would be able to leverage that self-driving into ridesharing so they could make money on their car when they’re not using it. Tesla has not completed many of the items on that Part Deux to-do list. There are no driverless Teslas roaming the streets on their way to pick up passengers, and the Cybertruck, which presumably is part of the plan to expand the EV product line, has yet to launch. So maybe Master Plan 3 will be committing to finish everything Tesla has started.

    "content": "SpaceX has managed to do another thing that seemed audacious and highly unlikely after a few early botched attempts. It used a ship at sea to catch the falling nosecone that shielded the cargo aboard its Falcon Heavy rocket during launch. The maneuver saw a SpaceX-owned barge called Ms. Tree rigged with a giant net slung across four large protruding beams navigate to a point off the Florida coast in the Atlantic Ocean to await the SpaceX fairing’s return once it separated from the rocket. Falcon Heavy launched from Kennedy Space Center last night for its STP-2 mission. After beginning its career serving the launches that take place from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, Ms. Tree (née Mr. Steven) traveled to the East Coast via the Panama Canal earlier in the year to make some attempts at catching SpaceX rockets launched from Florida. The boat was put into service during a SpaceX launch from Vandenberg for the first time in February 2017, but the fairing missed the net and the boat, and the same was true for three subsequent attempts in 2018, during which SpaceX also decked the boat out with larger nets to give it a better chance of success. This is a big deal for SpaceX because it likely makes reusing the fairings much more feasible. CEO Elon Musk has said that the company is basically throwing away $6 million every time it loses one of these fairings to a hard ocean landing, and so SpaceX has been working on a way to recover the parts – just like it recovers boosters via controlled descent. The nosecone parts (each launch has two, one fairing for each half of the payload capsule) have been able to control their descent using small thrusters and a parachute that SpaceX can steer to a degree from the ground since the company’s 2017 SES-10 mission. But until now they’ve dropped in the ocean, which makes recovery more challenging and difficult to refurbish. During this launch, Ms. Tree caught one half of the fairing as planned, and the other half landed in the water nearby. The big test now will be examining the returned caught fairing to determine if it’s suitable for refurbishment and re-flight, which could help a lot in trimming SpaceX launch costs.

    "content": "SpaceX is launching a Falcon 9 on February 17 (should the current target date stick) and the rocket is carrying a primary payload of a Spanish satellite for client Paz. The secondary cargo on the launch is more interesting, however, since it’s two of SpaceX’s own satellites – demonstration satellites the company is putting into orbit to test its plan to offer satellite-based broadband internet communications services. The rocket will include Microsat-2A and Microsat-2B (via TheNextWeb), small satellites with a planned useful lifetime of just 20 months. Both will contain Ku-band broadband transmitter radios, allowing them to test their ability to offer Earth-based connectivity from low-Earth orbit. SpaceX wants to test this before deploying a full constellation of its own broadband-providing satellites with a longer-term lifespan, since the private space company hopes to offer affordable, space-based broadband to clients on Earth as an additional revenue stream on top of its rocket launching business. The satellite internet side of its revenue picture could help it pay for ambitious projects like its proposed Mars missions, as SpaceX CEO Elon Musk explained previously when outlining the company’s long-term plans. Putting the Microsats into orbit is just one step towards making the broadband business a reality, but it’s a good sign that SpaceX’s grand vision is progressing. After a successful Falcon Heavy first flight earlier this month, and plans to fly Crew Dragon later this year, 2018 could be a banner year for Musk’s space venture.

    "content": "Confidential financial statements from SpaceX for 2018 and 2019 capture an early glimpse at the degree to which the company is likely dependent on its Starlink business unit, and bringing the Starship rocket online, to become cash flow positive. While the comprehensive balance sheets are five years old, they provide an intimate look inside the operations of arguably one of the most important, and secretive, private companies in the U.S. And they help shed light on what the company spent money on, and how much, as SpaceX grew itself from an unprofitable $2 billion in revenue to, reportedly, $9 billion for 2023 with a projected $15 billion in 2024 and $3 billion in earnings, sources familiar told Bloomberg in November. 2018 and 2019 were pivotal years for the company: In February 2018, SpaceX launched its Falcon Heavy rocket for the first time; the following March, the company nailed a pivotal flight test of its crew Dragon capsule, but exploded that same capsule a month later during ground testing. SpaceX was likely feeling pressure to deliver a safe, reliable spacecraft for NASA astronauts, so it could start realizing more dollars from the multibillion-dollar government contract it won for crew transportation services. That was also the year SpaceX launched its first 60 Starlink satellites. The service has become integral to the company’s overall plans — the core of which is to establish a human colony on Mars or, as CEO Elon Musk often puts it, “to expand the light of consciousness” throughout the universe. The company pulled in $1.98 billion in revenue in 2018 and $1.45 billion in 2019, but was operating at a net loss of -$308 million and -$501 million, respectively, according to comprehensive balance sheets from those years viewed by TechCrunch. The reason that revenue declined from 2018 to 2019 was because SpaceX changed the method it used to recognize revenue from, essentially, the percentage of a total contract that was completed to the percentage of discrete aspects of each contract completed due to a change in accounting regulations, the documents viewed by TechCrunch explained. SpaceX did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment on this story. The majority of the losses came from “cost of revenue,” a broad category that can encompass all costs related to production and distribution of a product or service. It also includes the costs of its personnel and its contractors, utilities and rent in this item. SpaceX even includes the depreciation of reusable launch vehicle hardware costs in this equation. The company was spending plenty of cash on research and development, too — $559 million in 2018 and $661 million the following year. Often companies include personnel costs in this line item (aka, it is the “development” part of R&D). But in SpaceX’s case, the financial statement notes that these costs primarily involved the Starlink and Starship programs. The Starlink program completed a milestone in 2019, when SpaceX launched the first batch of operational Starlink satellites in May of that year. The company ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $868 million for 2018 and $990 million for 2019. The balance sheets span the years after SpaceX netted the NASA contracts to deliver astronauts and cargo to and from the International Space Station. So it’s likely no surprise that money from the U.S. government, in the form of contracts with NASA, accounted for 37% of the revenue in 2018 and 83% in 2019. The company, whose valuation swelled to $180 billion late last year, has taken truly enormous strides since that May 2019 deployment of 60 Starlink satellites: There are now more than 5,500 active satellites deployed in orbit, with over 2.5 million customers. This is certainly reflected in its booming sales. The arrival of Starship may change the equation again. The massive rocket, which the company is currently subjecting to an orbital flight test campaign from its Texas launch site, will be necessary to keep up launch cadence for the second-generation satellites. Those spacecraft will be nearly twice as heavy as the first-gen sats, and additional spacecraft in orbit will help boost capacity for end users. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk admitted during a May 2022 interview that Starship “is the only thing that can carry the Starlink 2 satellites.” “Falcon [9] has neither the volume nor the mass-to-orbit capability required for Starlink 2,” he said. There are myriad questions about SpaceX’s more recent financials. The company launches its Starlink satellites with its own rocket, its Falcon 9 workhorse, which means it can launch the space-based internet satellites at unprecedented rates. Because the rocket booster is reusable, the company can also amortize the cost of hardware over time. But the longer it takes to bring Starship online, the longer it will take to roll out Starlink to millions more users around the world.

    "content": "Avery Haskell says he first knew he wanted to be an astronaut ever since he was a boy growing up in Houston near NASA’s Johnson Space Center. The 24-year-old Stanford graduate who counts Stephen Hawking and Carl Sagan as his heroes grew up in an entrepreneurial family. In the early days of the internet his mother, an accountant in the oil and gas industry, and father, an information technology technician for a railroad, launched their own startup called “Neighbornet” — an early version of Zillow (which never got off the ground). Haskell himself bounced around the startup industry, with forays into launching a crowdfunding startup and stints at a few mobile technology companies, before landing on his current venture, Shuttle. Launched earlier this year out of the Alchemist Accelerator and co-founded with cybersecurity expert and Wickr co-founder, Nico Sell, Shuttle is aiming to be the web and mobile-based booking agent for spaceflight. “Space is my first love,” said Haskell, who helped found the Stanford Space Initiative at his alma mater. “I’ve always wanted to be an astronaut and help more people become astronauts. I thought it would be cool to get more people to go to space and get more people interested in space travel.” Haskell met Sell at the Alchemist Accelerator, where she first worked as a mentor to the young entrepreneur. But she quickly became enamored with the idea of working at the edge of a new kind of frontier market. The day that Sell agreed to be the chair of Shuttle was the day Elon Musk’s SpaceX landed two booster rockets back on earth nearly simultaneously. SpaceX landed two of its three Falcon Heavy first-stage boosters “I’m following Elon into space,” said Sell. “When I first started working with Avery I had asked ‘Are we really ready for that now?’ And after working with him I’m convinced that we are.” Purchasing tickets on a flight listed on Shuttle isn’t the same as buying a plane ticket on Kayak, primarily because the price points are higher to the point of near-absurdity if you’re not a member of the super rich. Offerings will range from trips on Virgin Galactic trips that will cost upwards of $250,000 in the near term to low-end packages that will include a zero-gravity flight aboard a tricked-out Boeing 747 for the low, low price of just under $5,000 per seat. The company is actually taking orders for its first zero gravity flight, which it expects to launch from San Francisco in March 2019. That’ll give roughly 34 people the opportunity to experience weightlessness for around 8 minutes. “Our mission is to open space up to everyone,” says Haskell. “We want to get more people to space so that the price goes down and so that more people can see earth from space and become private astronauts.” Eventually, as more space tourism offerings become available, the company expects to sell additional packages. “There’s a luxury space hotel that’s being built right now,” says Sell. “It’s a million dollars a night and a 12 night minimum and every 90 minutes you see a sunset and a sunrise. Pretty soon there’s going to be a moon walk and a space walk that are available too.” Shuttle is hoping to be the hub that aggregates all of these offers into a single one-stop shopping and media experience for consumers interested in seeking out existing planets and boldly going where only few men (and women) have gone before. And the company will offer virtual space tours and tickets to launches for the plebes who can’t afford an actual ride. Initially, expect the ultra-rich or the ultra-subsidized to be the only folks that will be able to take these trips. Sell sees a lot of opportunities in corporate packages for business customers — likening it to a trip to Kelly Slater’s Surf Ranch for an executive retreat. Sell believes that there will be upwards of 100,000 people in the next 10 years who’ll be willing to plunk down the $50,000 to $250,000 that it will cost to go to space. Already, the company has $1.66 million in bookings off of 8 customers on four Virgin Galactic flights and four Zero Gravity Charters with commission rates of 5 percent to 10 percent on flights that average $250,000 per ticket. As for what comes next, Haskell has some speculations. “We will probably be able to build a base on the moon very soon. By 2030 that’s a possibility. Within my lifetime it will be pretty common for people to travel to and from other planets in space,” he said. For him, the importance of Shuttle is getting Earth’s human residents to realize the fragility of our existence on the tiny blue ball we all share. Haskell said his favorite quote from Carl Sagan was “We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.” And if that’s true, Haskell believes that the experience of traveling through the cosmos may be a way for humans to come to a better understanding of themselves as well.

Musk said in an X post that charging a small fee to new accounts was the “only way” to stop the “onslaught of bots.” Unfortunately, a small fee for new user write access is the only way to curb the relentless onslaught of bots. Current AI (and troll farms) can pass “are you a bot” with ease. You’ll have to wear your blue checkmark with pride from now on. In 2023, X rolled out a feature for paid users to hide their blue checkmarks from other users, but the company warned users that the feature would soon go away. BREAKING: #X seems to be removing the ability to hide the verification checkmark! pic.twitter.com/1Kn2OU4puj X is rolling out support for passkeys to all iOS users globally. Passkeys are a new and more secure login method compared with traditional passwords. The option debuted in January, but only for iOS users in the U.S. Update: Passkeys is now available as a login option for everyone globally on iOS! Try it out.https://t.co/v1LyN0l8wF X is giving free blue checks to users who have more than 2,500 “verified” followers, which are people who subscribe to X Premium. The move essentially reinvents the original purpose of the blue check, which was to prove notoriety or identification. In a post on X, Musk said that accounts with more than 2,500 “verified subscriber followers” will get access to Premium features for free. Accounts with more than 5,000 of those followers will get access to features from the Premium+ tier for free. Going forward, all 𝕏 accounts with over 2500 verified subscriber followers will get Premium features for free and accounts with over 5000 will get Premium+ for free — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 28, 2024 According to app researchers, X is working on an addition to its Communities feature that would let users create groups for adult content. As one of the few social networks that allows NSFW content, the new feature could give creators a more direct way to reach their audience. This is how it'll look like on the community page! pic.twitter.com/Sou18ze7Va — Nima Owji (@nima_owji) February 28, 2024 In a post on X, Musk announced that Grok will become available to all Premium subscribers. Previously, the AI chatbot was only available to subscribers of the higher-end tier Premium+ tier. Later this week, Grok will be enabled for all premium subscribers (not just premium+) https://t.co/4u9lbLwe23 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 26, 2024 According to a recent report from Sensor Tower, X usage in the U.S. was down 18% year-over-year as of February 2024, and down 23% since Musk’s acquisition. The report claims that the U.S. daily active user base has flatlined or declined every month since Musk’s takeover. Former CNN anchor Don Lemon announced that Elon Musk has canceled the deal for his upcoming talk show on X. In a statement, Lemon says the partnership was terminated hours after he interviewed Musk for the first episode of the show. In response, Musk said the show’s “approach was basically just ‘CNN, but on social media.” https://twitter.com/donlemon/status/1767948372999299549 Continuing on his promise to make X the “everything app,” Elon Musk is planning to launch a YouTube-like streaming app for Samsung and Amazon smart TVs. Musk said the dedicated app will allow users to watch videos from X on larger screens, like the Samsung TV and Amazon’s Fire TV. Coming soon https://t.co/JlnlSL7eS9 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 9, 2024 X Premium+ subscribers and verified organizations can now publish longer posts on the platform. The Articles feature lets users publish posts with text formatting, other X posts and embedded videos and images — similar to a blog post or a Medium article. The change comes after X increased the limit for long posts to 25,000 characters for paying users. Elon Musk launched audio and video calling on X in another bid to make it the “everything” app. The new feature is switched on by default, leaks your IP address to anyone you talk with, and can be incredibly confusing to figure out how to limit who can call you. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to turn it off. audio and video calling are now available to everyone on X! who are you calling first? pic.twitter.com/DYvB7ZRrbY — News (@XNews) February 28, 2024 Four former Twitter executives, including ex-CEO Parag Agrawal, sued Elon Musk, alleging that they’re owed over $128 million in severance payments. The lawsuit quotes Walter Isaacson’s biography of Musk, which quotes the X CEO as saying he would “hunt every single one” of Twitter’s C-suite “till the day they die.” X Corp is in court against the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) after accusing the extremism research organization of “actively working to assert false and misleading claims about X” in a lawsuit last year. The nonprofit, formed in 2018, conducts research on social media platforms to track hate speech, extremism and misinformation. A judge has hinted that the suit may be dismissed. X said it is withholding specific accounts and posts in India in response to executive orders issued by the Indian government. The company said it disagrees with the action, but noncompliance would have subjected the firm to “potential penalties including significant fines and imprisonment. Advertisers will soon be able to run ads next to select content creators on X. The move will allow advertisers to ensure that their ads don’t run next to controversial or offensive content, following an exodus of numerous brands from X last year after their ads appeared next to pro-Nazi content. X has forged a deal with BetMGM, making it X’s exclusive Live Odds Sports Betting partner and will introduce access to the betting service on X. Initially, X users in the U.S. will be able to explore the betting odds on pro football, with more professional and college sports to roll out over time. Sports never sleep on @X. And now with @BetMGM, we'll bring fans on X even closer to the action to cheer and now bet on their favorite teams!! Let’s do this! pic.twitter.com/MFrzhKLE78 — Linda Yaccarino (@lindayaX) February 9, 2024 After Tucker Carlson announced he would be interviewing Russian president Vladimir Putin on X, downloads of the app sent it to the top of the U.S. App Store overnight. Appfigures’ early estimates indicate X gained 117,000 new downloads on Tuesday, up from 93,000 the day before. 𝕏 is now the #1 most downloaded app of any kind! pic.twitter.com/TeqWxcmZfs — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 7, 2024 During the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing focused on kids’ online safety, Linda Yaccarino said that less than 1% of the app’s U.S. users were teens aged 13 through 17. Yaccarino also claimed that there were 90 million X users in the U.S. — a drop from its reported 95.4 million estimated users as of January 2023. X announced that it would staff a new “Trust and Safety” center in Austin, which will include 100 full-time content moderators. The move comes more than a year after Elon Musk acquired the company, which saw him drastically reducing headcount, including trust and safety teams, moderators, engineers and other staff. Nonconsensual deepfake porn of Taylor Swift went viral on X, with one post garnering more than 45 million views before it was removed. In response, Swifties organized a fandom-driven campaign to bury the AI-generated content searched under terms “taylor swift ai” or “taylor swift deepfake.” X quietly removed a feature for paid subscribers: the ability to set an NFT as their profile picture. The feature, which allowed Twitter Blue subscribers to set NFTs minted on Ethereum as custom hexagonal profile pictures, was originally launched by previous management in January 2022. Those who had NFT profile pictures still have hexagonal avatars, though it’s unclear if X will remove those as well. In a blog post, the company claims it will launch peer-to-peer payments this year, to unlock “more user utility and new opportunities for commerce.” X also said that AI would be used to “increasingly power the X user and advertising experience” in search, ads and a forthcoming “See Dissimilar Posts” feature. X temporarily suspended the accounts of multiple journalists, commentators and podcasters who have been critical of Elon Musk, including The Texas Observer’s Steven Monacelli, The Intercept’s Ken Klippenstein, MintPress News’ Alan MacLeod and The TrueAnon podcast. The impacted accounts were reinstated a few hours later. X started showing headlines at the bottom of link preview cards again using a small font. Multiple users reported that they could see titles on link cards on the web, with some titles being cut off due to character limits. The company seemingly pulled the new format hours later, but it’s now back. X’s “Verified Organizations” program now has a $200 per month tier intended for small businesses. The basic tier comes after X launched the $1,000 per month offering for businesses on the platform. Mutual fund company Fidelity marked down its investment in X holdings by 71.5% from the original valuation of shares. Fidelity spent $19.2 million to acquire a stake in X back in October 2022 and made a valuation cut of 65% a year later. X will be bringing video to Spaces in an attempt to get users to further engage with their audience without having to go to a third-party platform. Musk said X plans to launch the feature by the end of the year, but “certainly by early next year.” Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his media site Infowars are back on X after they were “permanently banned” from Twitter by the previous management in 2018. Musk ran a poll asking whether it was appropriate to bring Jones back to the platform. Nearly 2 million people voted, with about 70% saying Jones’ account should be restored. Reinstate Alex Jones on this platform? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 9, 2023 ‘Grok,’ xAI’s “rebellious” AI chatbot, has rolled out to all U.S. X Premium+ subscribers. Musk cautioned that the beta would face many issues, though it would be steadily improved. He also said that all English language users who subscribe to Premium+ would gain access to Grok in “about a week or so.” Musk is moving forward with his plans to morph X into a payments platform. The company in late November was granted three additional money transmitter licenses in South Dakota, Kansas and Wyoming, bringing the total number of states where the company is allowed to engage in money transfers to 12. A new report by the Financial Times says X will turn to small and medium-sized advertisers to shore up revenue. This comes after Elon Musk alienated big brands fleeing the platform over his endorsement of an antisemitic post. X filed a lawsuit alleging defamation by Media Matters over claims that major companies like IBM, Apple and Oracle had ads appear next to antisemitic content. “The split second court opens on Monday, X Corp will be filing a thermonuclear lawsuit against Media Matters and all those who colluded in this fraudulent attack on our company,” Musk said. X will reportedly start showing headlines in preview cards with URLs on the platform after removing them in October. Musk said an update will overlay the headline in the upper portion of the image of a URL card. He didn’t mention any specific timeline for rollout for the update. In an upcoming release, 𝕏 will overlay title in the upper potion of the image of a URL card — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 23, 2023 After Musk amplified antisemitic conspiracy theories on X, numerous high-profile advertisers paused their spending on the platform. They include: Apple, Comcast/NBCUniversal, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, IBM, Paramount Global, Lionsgate, European Commission, Walmart and as of the time of this update’s publication, TechCrunch. X also lost a high-profile brand campaign with Paris Hilton’s 11:11 Media, which would have seen Hilton promoting key X features like live video, live e-commerce, X Spaces and more over a two-year period. At the DealBook conference, Musk told advertisers who recently paused their ad spending on X to “go fuck yourself.” X CEO Linda Yaccarino later publicly backed Musk and his remarks. In pursuit of becoming the “everything app,” X is attempting to compete in the hiring space. X unveiled its new job search feature, where Verified Organizations can post job listings that users can then search through by keyword and location. X plans for more updates in the future, including more sophisticated filtering tools, a job recommendations feature and the ability to bookmark roles. Introducing our job search tool. Start exploring jobs on web at https://t.co/0A5snlK8Ne. pic.twitter.com/4KS0016M5N — Hiring (@XHiring) November 16, 2023 X was caught running unlabeled ads in September. Now the issue is in the hands of the FTC. Independent non-profit Check My Ads filed a formal complaint with the FTC urging an investigation over the advertising practices at X, including the lack of disclosure about which posts are ads. X’s For You feed typically surfaces popular and trending posts from its broader network alongside highlights from those you follow. The new algorithm update instead surfaces posts from smaller accounts, according to an X post by Elon Musk. As part of a timeline takeover, conservative media nonprofit PragerU promoted the hashtag “#DETRANS” to advertise an anti-trans film. In a press release, PragerU noted that it chose X specifically for its ad campaign “as it is one of the least censored social media platforms” after being purchased by Elon Musk. On October 31, X shut down Circles, the much-beloved feature that allowed users to post to a small, exclusive audience similar to Instagram’s Close Friends. It remains unclear why Circles was sunsetted a bit more than a year after its August 2022 launch. “This new test was developed to bolster our already successful efforts to reduce spam, manipulation of our platform, and bot activity while balancing platform accessibility with the small fee amount. It is not a profit driver,” the company said. The company plans to use payment, phone and ID verification to stop bots. Starting today, we’re testing a new program (Not A Bot) in New Zealand and the Philippines. New, unverified accounts will be required to sign up for a $1 annual subscription to be able to post & interact with other posts. Within this test, existing users are not affected. — Support (@Support) October 17, 2023 According to data from market intelligence firm Similarweb, X’s global site traffic was down 14% YoY in September. U.S. traffic was down by 19%. Performance had also declined 17.8% YoY on mobile devices in the U.S., based on monthly active users on iOS and Android. Admins of private Communities on X can now require users to answer a question when they request to join, along with agreeing to the group’s rules. The new feature could help admins and moderators decide who should be able to join and offer some protection against spammers and bots. A series of updates were made to Community Notes after the fact-checking system took multiple days to correct misinformation related to the Israel-Hamas war. The changes include: X/Twitter removed the requirement of having at least 100,000 followers for posts to be newsworthy. Prior to the policy change, only verified accounts would be considered for newsworthy posts. However, now that X allows people to get verified by paying for a subscription, the new version of the policy says posts only by “a high-profile account” counts as newsworthy posts. However, the updated page doesn’t give details on what kind of accounts are considered “high-profile.” The new control is not restricted to paid/premium accounts. Users who don’t pay for X Premium can also choose to not let non-verified users reply to their posts. The feature originally limited replies to either “Accounts you follow” or “Only accounts you mention” in 2020, but users could only choose this setting before posting a tweet. In 2021, they updated the feature to allow users to control replies after a tweet was published. X CEO Linda Yaccarino discussed the plan in a briefing to X debt holders on October 5th. It’s not clear when the three-tier subscription plan would go live, but references found in the X app’s code by @aaronp613 reference a “Premium Basic,” “Premium Standard” and “Premium Plus” plan, which have full ads, half the ads or no ads, respectively. Now you will only be able to see an image with the domain name of the link on the bottom left, which is easy to miss. The change is part of Musk’s efforts to get users to post “long-form content” directly on the platform rather than encouraging users to click out of the platform with link cards. Trademark attorney Josh Gerben and his firm are representing what seems to be the first client to sue X over its trademark — a Florida-based social media ad agency, X Social Media. The complaint, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, states that X Social Media, LLC “has continuously used the X Social Media Mark in commerce since at least early 2016,” and has significantly invested in marketplace awareness, which included developing a distinctive “X” mark that’s associated with its social media advertising services. “X is deprecating Circles as of Oct 31st, 2023. After this date, you will not be able to create new posts that are limited to your Circle, nor will you be able to add people to your Circle. You will, however, be able to remove people from your Circle, by unfollowing them as described below,” X said on its support page. New code in the X app reveals that both audio and video calls will be supported. However, the feature will only be available to those with an X Premium membership, it appears. The new findings were uncovered by tech veteran-turned-investor Chris Messina inside the X app’s code. In a live-streamed conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, X Owner Elon Musk said the company was “moving to a small monthly payment” for the use of the platform. He suggested that such a change would be necessary to deal with the problem of bots. Musk didn’t confirm what the new subscription payment would cost, but described it as a “small amount of money.” X has launched government ID-based account verification via a partnership with Israel-based Au10tix for paid users to prevent impersonation and give them benefits such as “prioritized support.” The pop-up for ID verification indicates that the Au10tix could store this data for up to 30 days. While scrolling the Following feed on a Mac using the Chrome web browser, TechCrunch encountered a handful of unlabeled ads amid other posts from people we follow, as well as other ads that did properly display the “Ad” label at the top right of the post. Because many of X’s ads are still labeled, this makes the unlabeled ones even harder to spot. It’s unclear if the issue is a glitch with X’s advertising platform or a deliberate change. The new terms, which are effective from September 29, ban any kind of scraping or crawling without “prior written consent.” NOTE: crawling or scraping the Services in any form, for any purpose without our prior written consent is expressly prohibited. The previous version of the terms allowed crawling in accordance with robots.txt. Community Notes is an existing program for crowdsourced moderation. X announced that notes by contributors attached to a video will show up in all posts with that video. “Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes,” the updated policy reads. X hasn’t specified what it means by biometric information, but it is usually used to describe a person’s physical characteristics, such as their face or fingerprints. X also hasn’t provided details on how it plans to collect it. Paid users on X now have a setting under profile customization that lets them hide the Likes tab. The move comes after rival social networks Threads and Bluesky rolled out the ability for users to see their own likes. X confirmed it’s lifting its ban on paid political ads — a move it committed to earlier this year, shortly after Elon Musk took over the social network previously known as Twitter. The company had originally banned these ads in 2019 under then-CEO Jack Dorsey’s management. The company announced it would offer a one-time ad credit of $250 to select businesses when they spend $1,000 or more on new ad campaigns over the next 30 days. The company said in a post that it’s discontinuing some of the endpoints while migrating others to the new v2 API. X also said that it is retiring the legacy Essential and Elevated tiers, and customers using them will need to move to any of the new tiers. Musk confirmed the move to roll out a new way to display news links without any headline or description in a post, saying the move was coming “directly” from him. The change would “greatly improve the aesthetics,” he said. As of right now, a Twitter card for a news article shows the headline and summary text along with the header image in the preview card of a post. If the proposed change comes through, X will only show the image with a link in a post. That means if a publication or a blog doesn’t post any accompanying text with the link, users will only see the link and the image for that article. “Block is going to be deleted as a ‘feature’, except for DMs,” Elon Musk wrote on X. “Makes no sense.” The post was a response to a Tesla fan account who asked whether there was any reason to use block instead of mute. Posts, formerly called tweets, still appear in chronological order on profiles when you’re logged into the social network, but once you log out, they are sorted by performance. Our tests show that even if you have a pinned post, it won’t appear at the top of your profile feed when logged out, which defeats the point of a pinned post. X began rolling out the new ‘Highlights’ tab to some subscribers in mid August. But according to the updated support page, the company is now making the feature available to all paid users. Previously known as TweetDeck, X Pro is now a subscriber-only product. The move isn’t entirely surprising, as on July 3, the company said that within 30 days TweetDeck would be accessible to only verified users. However, the social network was delayed in implementing the new rule by a few days. The company said that creators who have garnered 5 million impressions in the last three months will be eligible for ad revenue sharing. That requirement was previously set to 15 million impressions. Creators will be able to withdraw as low as $10 instead of $50, X said. Users still need to be verified and must have at least 500 followers to qualify for payouts. “I’ve been at the company eight weeks,” Yaccarino said in her first broadcast interview since taking on her new role. “The operational run rate right now… we’re pretty close to break even.” “Our data licensing and API with X is an incredible business. Our new subscription business [is] growing,” Yaccarino said. “And then, part of my, what I would say, expertise and experience, and what I came to do, was to drive advertising at the company.” CEO Linda Yaccarino confirmed in her first TV interview that video calls will be a new feature coming to the service, as part of its transformation into an “everything app.” The partnership began in January to tell advertisers if their ad is placed around inappropriate content. Now, X is testing sensitivity settings, powered by machine learning, that let advertisers choose their thresholds for the kinds of content they want their ads to appear around — and according to a tweet from X owner Elon Musk, advertisers can buy these less desirable, “relaxed” sensitivity ad slots for less. Brands can reduce adjacency to gore, excessive profanity and obscenity, targeted hate speech, sexual content, drugs and spam. Soon, X will add its “relaxed” setting, which offers cheaper advertising opportunities while only filtering for targeted hate speech and explicit sexual content. The @music account was originally operated for 16 years by software developer Jeremy Vaught, who grew the @music handle to roughly half a million followers. Vaught posted in anger that X had commandeered the account for itself. “Super pissed,” Vaught wrote on X, sharing a screenshot of the email X had sent him informing him of the change. The feature historically provided information to users about why they were seeing a fact check appended to a tweet. After three years of development, the company says this extra context will now be removed for those who are already experienced with Community Notes. The company has adopted the @Pro handle instead of @TweetDeck for the tool. However, many parts of the tool, including the help page, still have “Twitter” and “TweetDeck” mentions. Musk hinted at the change a week prior, adding that XPro will come with a “wide range of psy op plugins.” There are no details about what kind of plug-ins those might be. Paid verification was introduced last year with the Twitter Blue relaunch. The service was recently renamed to XBlue during the Twitter rebrand to X. The idea is to help users benefit from subscription features without showing that they are a verified account. The option to hide the checkmark will show up in the “Profile customization” section of account settings. The company has updated the help page for paid subscriptions, saying that even if you hide the checkmark it might be visible in some places. The company didn’t give any further details about those placeholders. Apple typically doesn’t allow developers to name their apps as a single character, but they seemed to have made an exception. X also changed its App Store tagline from “Let’s talk.” to “Blaze Your Glory!!” Musk himself posted a tweet with this tagline without any context. The company announced its “Ads Revenue Sharing” program is now available for eligible creators globally. The program, according to posts by X owner Elon Musk, aims to give out $5 million in the first round of creator payments. The iconic bird logo is officially replaced with ‘X’ after Elon Musk announced the change the weekend of July 22. Notably, Musk x.com now also redirects to twitter.com. Musk also called this an “interim” logo, so we might see another logo change in the future. The app also changed its official handle to @x as part of the ongoing rebranding. The original @Twitter handle is now inactive, and its bio reads, “This account is no longer active. Follow @x for updates.” However, the original owner of the @x handle, Gene X Hwang of the corporate photography and videography studio Orange Photography, confirmed to TechCrunch that the company took over his account without warning or financial compensation, telling him the handle is property of X. https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy now points to https://t.co/AYBszklpkE. Interim X logo goes live later today. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 23, 2023 Twitter hasn’t officially announced the job postings feature yet, although some verified organizations have already been able to post job listings under their bios. The job listings take applicants directly to the company’s website, where they can learn more about the position and submit an application. Twitter Notes, the feature that allows Twitter users to publish long-form content, appears to be back on track, according to a post from Twitter owner Elon Musk on Tuesday. Musk confirmed the company’s plans in response to a user’s tweet which claimed the Twitter Notes project had recently been rebranded as “Articles.” On Tuesday, July 18, user @FaustoChou tweeted that Notes had been renamed to Articles, signaling perhaps renewed development efforts on Twitter’s part. His screenshot showed the Notes interface, looking much like it did before, as well as other unlaunched features, like Twitter Coins. Musk replied to the tweet, confirming Twitter’s plans. Twitter will now pay creators for a share of the ad revenue earned from ads served in the replies to their posts. Twitter Blue subscribers who have earned more than 5 million tweet impressions each month for the last 3 months are eligible to join the creator payouts. According to Elon Musk, the first round of creator payouts will total $5 million, and will be cumulative from the month of February onward. These payouts will be delivered via Stripe. Despite the program’s significant payouts, some creators weren’t happy — and took their complaints to Twitter owner Elon Musk. In a series of tweets, Musk addressed creators’ concerns over things like the types of accounts that were eligible for monetization, rate limits and other issues. Starting “as soon as” July 14, Twitter will introduce a new messages setting aimed at reducing spam in DMs by moving messages from Verified users you don’t follow back to your “Message Request” inbox instead of your main inbox. Only messages from people you follow will arrive in your primary inbox going forward. Notably, these changes will also now apply to everyone who has their inboxes open to allow messages from anyone. Before becoming pay-to-play, Twitter verification indicated a person was a public or notable figure of some sort — like a politician, celebrity, athlete, journalist or other well-known individual. By making the Verified blue checkmark accessible to anyone who purchased it, Twitter diluted the value of verification. That apparently escalated to the point that people have become bothered by Verified users spamming their main inbox, when they had set it open to receive DMs from the blue-badged crowd. In other words, Twitter has a Verified user spam problem. Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino is pushing back at reports that Twitter traffic is tanking as a result of the July 5 launch of a new competitor, Instagram Threads. However, on Monday, July 10, users reported that Twitter seems to be selectively blocking links to Threads.net’s website in Twitter searches, making it more difficult for anyone to surface conversations on Threads or locate users’ profiles. Less than 24 hours after Threads launched, the Elon Musk-owned company accused Meta of poaching former Twitter employees to create the new platform. “Twitter intends to strictly enforce its intellectual property rights, and demands that Meta take immediate steps to stop using any Twitter trade secrets or other highly confidential information,” Spiro wrote in the letter, which Semafor shared online. “Twitter reserves all rights, including, but not limited to, the right to seek both civil remedies and injunctive relief without further notice to prevent any further retention, disclosure, or use of its intellectual property by Meta.” After swaths of users were unable to access parts of TweetDeck over the last few days, Twitter started rolling out a new version of the web app to users July 3. The company also added that in 30 days, users will have to be verified to access TweetDeck. This means only Twitter Blue subscribers, verified organizations and some folks who have been gifted verification by Twitter will be able to use TweetDeck come August. Twitter is putting limits to how many tweets its users can read as the social media platform suffers extended outage that has stymied users’ ability to track new posts. Verified account holders can peruse a maximum of 6,000 posts daily, while unverified users must contend with a drastically reduced limit of 600 posts. Newly registered, unverified users face even tighter restrictions with an allowance of a mere 300 posts per day, according to Elon Musk. (He has since increased the limit to 10,000, 1,000 and 500, respectively.) These read limits impacted TweetDeck users in particular, reporting major problems including notifications and entire columns failing to load. If you’re not logged into your Twitter account, or don’t have one, and try to view a tweet, you’ll be presented with a sign-in screen. However, days later, Twitter silently removed the login requirement for viewing tweets. When Twitter started enforcing the login requirement, Musk said that he took these “temporary” measures to prevent data scraping. The company hasn’t made any official announcement about allowing users to view links when you aren’t logged in or given any details on what measures it has taken to stop scraping. The company made the change to its Twitter Blue page today, indicating the limit. An engineer at Twitter, Prachi Poddar, also announced the change by posting a long tweet. The National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA), representing 17 publishers, listed 1,700 songs for which it sent multiple copyright violation notices to Twitter. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Nashville, says that Twitter didn’t take any action against these notices. The publishers’ organization said in the filing that it is seeking fines of up to $150,000 for each violation. The lawsuit alleged that the social network “fuels its business with countless infringing copies of musical ‘compositions, violating Publishers’ and others’ exclusive rights under copyright law.” It added that, unlike its competitors TikTok and Instagram, Twitter hasn’t struck a music licensing deal for the use of copyrighted music. Court documents show that Twitter owes three months’ rent to its Boulder landlord, and a judge has signed off on evicting the tech giant from that office. In May the landlord took it to court, and on May 31 the judge issued an order that the sheriff should assist in the eviction of Twitter within the next 49 days — i.e. before the end of July. The case number is 2023CV30342 in Boulder District Court. As many as 300 employees once worked in Twitter’s Boulder offices, but between layoffs, other firings, and resignations, it is probably less than half of that now. The time limit to edit tweets has increased from 30 minutes to one hour for Blue subscribers, giving users a bigger window to change their tweets and correct any typos. Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino officially started her new gig on Monday, June 5, according to a tweet. It happened — first day in the books! — Linda Yaccarino (@lindayacc) June 6, 2023 Ella Irwin took over for Yoel Roth, who famously left the company during the early days of Elon Musk’s chaotic Twitter takeover. The latest feature is an effort to put more onus on crowdsourced moderation by allowing users to address scenarios of morphed images or AI-generated images across the platform where the photos are posted. The launches comes days after a fake AI-generated image about an attack on the Pentagon spread quickly as prominent accounts retweeted it. Twitter API Pro for startups gives developers the ability to fetch 1 million tweets per month and post 300,000 tweets per month, and gives them access to the full archive search endpoint. Twitter made changes to its paid plan, allowing subscribers to upload two-hour videos — expanding the previous 60-minute limit. The company also modified its Twitter Blue page and said the video file size limit for paid users is now increased from 2GB to 8GB. While earlier longer video upload was only possible from the web, now it’s also possible through the iOS app. Despite these changes, the maximum quality for upload still remains 1080p. Musk confirmed Yaccarino’s new role in a tweet this morning (May 12), a day after he announced that he had completed his search for a new CEO. “Excited to announce that I’ve a new CEO for X/Twitter,” Musk wrote in a tweet on May 11. “She will be starting in ~6 weeks! My role will transition to being exec chair & CTO, overseeing product, software & sysops.” Currently, this feature is only available to verified Blue users or accounts associated with verified organizations. Additionally, the encryption feature isn’t compatible with group messages and Twitter doesn’t offer protection against man-in-the-middle attacks. Twitter has introduced a new feature that lets users choose almost any emoji to react to a DM in a conversation. Previously, the company allowed you to react to only the most recent DM with only a select set of emojis. CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the new feature is rolling out with the latest app update. According to recent tweets by owner Elon Musk, Twitter is purging inactive accounts that have had “no activity at all for several years.” We’re purging accounts that have had no activity at all for several years, so you will probably see follower count drop — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 8, 2023 Twitter is thinking about an organizational verification plan that doesn’t cost $1,000 a month. Over the Cinco de Mayo weekend, Elon Musk tweeted that the company is working on a cheaper plan for small businesses, but didn’t give any details about the cost. We will have a lower cost tier for small businesses, but need to manage the onboarding of organizations carefully to prevent fraud. The $1000/month is meant for larger organizations. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 6, 2023 Twitter confirmed a security error that made Circle tweets surface publicly. TechCrunch reported the glitch in early April, but the platform confirmed the issue May 5 in an email sent to Twitter Circle users. “In April 2023, a security incident may have allowed users outside of your Twitter Circle to see tweets that should have otherwise been limited to the Circle to which you were posting,” the email said. Twitter claims that the bug has now been fixed, and that the team knows what caused it. Twitter announced on May 2 that it is making its API free for verified government or public-owned services posting about public utility alerts such as weather alerts, transportation information and emergency warnings. This comes a month after the company announced its new API pricing tiers. It doesn’t seem to matter what text you’re adding to your bio — TechCrunch reporter Amanda Silberling added a few spaces, then got her check back for a moment. It even showed up with the old text that designates that she is “notable in government, news, entertainment, or another designated category,” and she did not, in fact, pay for this. But once you refresh the page it disappears. In fact, it’s unclear whether anyone else can even see your check briefly reappear. Twitter was confirmed April 25 as one of 19 major tech platforms subject to centralized oversight by the European Union’s executive starting this fall, when so-called very large online platforms (VLOPs) are expected to be compliant with the Digital Services Act (DSA). But the Commission has not wasted any time warning the Elon Musk-owned social network that things aren’t looking good for staying on the right side of the incoming law. In a pair of tweets, Vera Jourova, the EU’s values and transparency VP, warned of “yet another negative sign” by Twitter — accusing the platform under Musk of “not making digital information space any safer and free from the Kremlin #disinformation & malicious influence”. Twitter said that labels will be shown to both authors and viewers. Usually, these tweets will show text such as “Visibility limited: this Tweet may violate Twitter’s rules against Hateful Conduct.” The app’s enforcement policy says that tweets with such labels will not show up in search results, recommendations or timelines — those tweets will be hidden in both the “For You” and “Following timelines. Additionally, there will be no ads placed adjacent to posts with reduced visibility. Over the April 21st weekend, multiple top accounts (with more than 1 million followers) got their verification marks back. However, many of them, including writer Neil Gaiman, footballer Riyad Mahrez, musician Lil Nas X, actress Janel Parrish Long and British TV presenter Richard Osman said that they didn’t pay for the blue badge. In March, The New York Times reported that Twitter was considering handing out a free verification mark to the top 10,000 brands and companies. It’s not clear if the company is applying the same policy to personal accounts. Twitter has removed “government-funded media” labels on all accounts, from NPR to the Chinese state-affiliated Xinhua News. The app even appears to have deleted its web page explaining the “government-funded media” labels. Several users have posted screenshots of an email reportedly sent by Twitter, which states that starting from April 21, verified checkmarks are required to continue running ads on the platform. WOW… Twitter is now telling advertisers it MUST subscribe to Twitter Blue or Verified Organisations to continue running ads! pic.twitter.com/4DrDu82Zi0 — Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) April 21, 2023 With the legacy checks gone, the app will have verification marks only for paid users and businesses, as well as government entities and officials. Now if a user sees a blue check mark and clicks on it, the label reads: “This account is verified because they are subscribed to Twitter Blue and verified their phone number.” Microsoft is dropping the bird app from its advertising platform starting on April 25, nearly two months after Twitter announced that it will begin charging a minimum of $42,000 per month to users of its API, including enterprises and research institutions. The moves mean users will no longer be able to access their account, or create, schedule or otherwise manage tweets through Microsoft’s free social media management service. Twitter owner Elon Musk threatened to take legal action: They trained illegally using Twitter data. Lawsuit time. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 19, 2023 Twitter updated its content moderation guidelines regarding hateful content, removing a policy that prohibited the targeted deadnaming or misgendering of transgender people. Enacted in 2018, the policy explicitly stated that it violated Twitter’s rules to repeatedly and purposefully call a transgender person by the wrong name or pronouns. Twitter plans to “soon” begin adding visible labels on tweets that have been identified as potentially violating its policies, which has impacted their visibility. It did not say when exactly the system would be fully rolled out across its network. Typically, when tweets violate Twitter’s policies, one of the actions the company can take is to limit the reach of those tweets — or something it calls “visibility filtering.” In these scenarios, the tweets remain online but become less discoverable, as they’re excluded from areas like search results, trends, recommended notifications, For You and Following timelines, and more. Historically, the wider public would not necessarily know if a tweet had been moderated in this way. Now Twitter says that will change. Twitter’s new feature will let Blue subscribers post 10,000-character-long posts — as if the social network is trying to compete with a rival newsletter platform. Twitter has also added support for bold and italic text formatting. Long-form writing is also not entirely new. Last June, the company introduced a program called Twitter Notes for select writers. However, that program was shut down under Musk. After taking over the company he also killed newsletter tool Revue, a startup Twitter had acquired in 2021. A PBS spokesperson confirmed to Axios that PBS had “no plans to resume tweeting” after Twitter gave it a murky “government-funded media” label over the weekend. A few other news entities appeared to have followed suit, including the prominent Boston NPR affiliate WBUR, Hawaii Public Radio and LA-based local news source LAist. The Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC Australia), Australia’s Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), New Zealand’s public broadcaster RNZ, Sweden’s SR Ekot and SVT, and Catalonia’s TV3.cat a were labeled “government-funded media” weeks later. This expands upon the social network’s Cashtag feature, which provided info about a limited number of stocks and crypto coins through TradingView data. The new partnership with eToro goes beyond just displaying information. It also redirects users to the eToro site where they can engage in trading. If you search for a stock on Twitter, you will see a button saying “View on eToro,” which redirects to the site. 🎉Very excited to be launching a new $Cashtags partnership with @Twitter which will enable Twitter users to see real-time prices for a much wider range of stocks, crypto & other assets as well as having the option to invest through eToro. @elonmusk https://t.co/Iv2q9iNxbf — eToro (@eToro) April 13, 2023 Elon Musk gave a rare interview to an actual reporter late on Tuesday, speaking to BBC reporter James Clayton on Twitter Spaces. During the interview, Clayton pressed Musk on whether his purchase of Twitter was, in the end, something he went through with willingly, or whether it was something he did because the active court case at the time in which Twitter was trying to force him to go through with the sale was going badly. The answer was that Musk did indeed only do the deal because he believed legally, he was going to be forced to do so anyway. This is the “final date,” he said in a tweet. If the move goes through, Twitter will have verification marks only for paid users and businesses, and government entities and officials. Final date for removing legacy Blue checks is 4/20 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 11, 2023 Twitter, Inc. is now called X Corp., according to a court filing in California. Since Twitter is no longer a public company, it does not have to report updates like name changes to the SEC. But in any case, the new name was spotted in an April 4 document related to far-right activist Laura Loomer’s lawsuit against Twitter and Facebook. “Twitter, Inc. has been merged into X Corp. and no longer exists,” the document states. The lawsuit, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, alleged that Twitter has to pay more than $1 million to the former executives for legal bills they incurred while at the company to respond to requests by the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission. Numerous Twitter users reported a bug on April 10 in which Circle tweets are surfacing on the algorithmically generated For You timeline. That means that your supposedly private posts might breach containment to reach an unintended audience, which could quickly spark some uncomfortable situations. TechCrunch has spoken to multiple users who have also experienced this glitch firsthand; many more have reported the glitch in their tweets. Most often, it seems that Circle tweets are being surfaced in the For You timeline to users who follow the poster, but are not in their Circle. Others have reported that their Circle tweets are reaching even further than those who follow them. The Elon Musk-owned platform has resumed surfacing accounts of Vladimir Putin and the Russian Embassy in search results. A former Twitter employee told the publication that this move is likely because of a policy change. Twitter is censoring Substack links by making the posts impossible to reply to, like or retweet. While quote-tweeting works, simply pressing the retweet button surfaces an error message: “Some actions on this Tweet have been disabled by Twitter.” You didn’t hear this from us, but if you link to a Substack via a redirected URL, it seems to post without restrictions. Twitter is rolling out additional features for Blue subscribers including showing 50% of ads in their timeline compared to non-paid users and a visibility boost in search. “As you scroll, you will see approximately twice as many organic or non-promoted Tweets placed in between promoted Tweets or ads. There may be times when there are more or fewer non-promoted Tweets between promoted Tweets,” Twitter’s description of the feature says. While Twitter is claiming to reduce ads on paid subscribers’ feeds, it is hard to prove if they are actually seeing fewer ads apart from anecdotal experiences. NPR’s Twitter account on the platform now comes with a tag denoting it as “US state-affiliated media.” But NPR doesn’t meet Twitter’s own definition for a state-affiliated account: State-affiliated media is defined as outlets where the state exercises control over editorial content through financial resources, direct or indirect political pressures, and/or control over production and distribution… State-financed media organizations with editorial independence, like the BBC in the UK for example, are not defined as state-affiliated media for the purposes of this policy. Nicely done, @elonmusk 🤣 pic.twitter.com/jvX15QWSf5 — Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) April 5, 2023 NPR later announced that it will no longer be posting content to its 52 official Twitter feeds, becoming the first major news organization to go silent on the social media platform. Musk had claimed that starting on April 1, blue checkmarks that previously indicated that an account was legitimate, verified and notable would be maintained only for those who have a subscription to Twitter Blue. The change would be part of a wider push for Twitter to gate previously free features, and bundle new ones, under the $8 per month Twitter Blue subscription, which costs $11 on iOS and Android devices. As numerous celebrities and businesses spoke out to say they wouldn’t pay the $8 fee, it appeared that removing so many blue checks would be easier said than done. Instead, Twitter merely updated the text accompanying a blue check to make it unclear whether someone was verified for being notable, or for paying for Twitter Blue. In an ultimate act of pettiness, Twitter removed The New York Times’ verification check when the news giant said it wouldn’t pay for verification. Based on early returns, the revamped Twitter Blue has yet to contribute significantly to Twitter’s bottom line, with just $11 million generated from mobile signups in its first three months. The three API tiers include a free level meant for content posting bots, a $100/month basic level and a costly enterprise level. Subscribing to any level gets access to the Ads API at no additional cost. Twitter mentioned that over the next 30 days, the company will discontinue old access levels, including Standard (for v1.1), Essential and Elevated (for v2), and Premium. Developers remain unhappy with Twitter’s new API structure. Introducing a new form of Free (v2) access for write-only use cases and those testing the Twitter API with 1,500 Tweets/month at the app level, media upload endpoints, and Login with Twitter. Get started: https://t.co/CqCRD3vbE5 — Twitter Dev (@TwitterDev) March 29, 2023 Musk justified the move by saying this was the “only realistic way to address advanced AI bot swarms taking over.” Starting April 15th, only verified accounts will be eligible to be in For You recommendations. The is the only realistic way to address advanced AI bot swarms taking over. It is otherwise a hopeless losing battle. Voting in polls will require verification for same reason. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 27, 2023 Twitter decreases the wait to purchase Twitter Blue for newly created Twitter accounts from 90 days to 30 days. “New subscriptions to Twitter Blue are available globally on web, iOS, or Android. Not all features are available on all platforms. Newly created Twitter accounts will not be able to subscribe to Twitter Blue for 30 days. We may also impose waiting periods for new accounts in the future at our discretion, and without notice,” the Twitter Blue page reads. Twitter announced that the removal of legacy blue checkmarks will begin April 1 for users that are not subscribed to Twitter Blue. Elon tweeted back in December that the company will remove legacy checkmarks “in a few months.” After that, users with legacy blue checks had been seeing a pop-up when they clicked on their checkmark, which read, “This is a legacy verified account. It may or may not be notable.” But once Twitter botched this removal of checkmarks, they changed the copy again — as of now, users cannot distinguish whether someone has a checkmark because they paid, or because they were deemed notable. On April 1st, we will begin winding down our legacy verified program and removing legacy verified checkmarks. To keep your blue checkmark on Twitter, individuals can sign up for Twitter Blue here: https://t.co/gzpCcwOpLp Organizations can sign up for https://t.co/RlN5BbuGA3… — Twitter Verified (@verified) March 23, 2023 Twitter’s Tor service, a version of the site that could be accessed even in countries where the social network is banned, has gone dark after the company failed to renew its certificate, which expired on March 6. Pavel Zoneff, director of strategic communications at the Tor Project, told TechCrunch that the site “is no longer available seemingly with no plans to renew.” This expansion makes the social network’s subscription service available in more than 35 countries across the world. These countries include Netherlands, Poland, Ireland, Belgium, Sweden, Romania, Czech Republic, Finland, Denmark, Greece, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Slovakia, Latvia, Slovenia, Estonia, Croatia, Luxembourg, Malta and Cyprus. Twitter laid off more than 200 employees in its fourth round of cuts, including loyalist Esther Crawford — the chief executive of Twitter payments who oversaw the company’s Twitter Blue verification subscription. Twitter’s staff is down from about 7,500 employees to less than 2,000 since Musk. Lots of speculation among ex employees that Musk must be about to install a whole new regime and that’s why he is cleaning house. Otherwise the cuts don’t make sense. “Hard to keep the lights on with the people who are still left,” one ex manager told me. — Alex Heath (@alexeheath) February 26, 2023 One of the numerous rounds of cuts eliminated the platform’s entire accessibility team. Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) called on Elon Musk to bring the accessibility team back in an open letter. Markey requested a response by March 17. After updating its ad policy on February 15, Twitter became the first social media app in the U.S. to allow cannabis advertising. Cannabis ads will run on Twitter in U.S. states where cannabis is legal and in Canada. The initial date set to cut free access to Twitter’s API was February 9, which was then extended to February 13. Now, the social network has delayed the shutdown again, this time with no date set. There has been an immense amount of enthusiasm for the upcoming changes with Twitter API. As part of our efforts to create an optimal experience for the developer community, we will be delaying the launch of our new API platform by a few more days. — Twitter Dev (@TwitterDev) February 13, 2023 The delay jeopardizes the plans of developers and startups building tools around the Twitter API as they wouldn’t have any clarity on future spending and budget allocation on the developer platform. The company originally planned to shut down free access to its API on February 9. Now it has extended this deadline to February 13. Twitter said that it will charge $100 per month for the basic tier of API. This will get developers access to a “low level of API usage,” as well as the Ads API. We have been busy with some updates to the Twitter API so you can continue to build and innovate with us. We’re excited to announce an extension of the current free Twitter API access through February 13. Here’s what we’re shipping then 🧵 — Twitter Dev (@TwitterDev) February 8, 2023 When developers trying to seek clarity around the new API rules went to the developer forum website, they found that the site had been put behind a login. The forum was finally accessible four days later on February 13. Twitter announced the ability to post longer tweets for paid users on February 8. Instead of being limited to 280 characters, paying Blue subscribers can post tweets that are up to 4,000 characters. While only Twitter Blue subscribers can post long tweets, all users will be able to read them. You will see only the first 280 characters on the timeline, and if you want to read more, you can click on “Show more.” need more than 280 characters to express yourself? we know that lots of you do… and while we love a good thread, sometimes you just want to Tweet everything all at once. we get that. so we’re introducing longer Tweets! you’re gonna want to check this out. tap this 👉… — Twitter Blue (@TwitterBlue) February 8, 2023 Elon Musk announced in a tweet on February 3 that the company would soon begin sharing advertising revenue with creators on the platform for the first time. He follows up the announcement with a catch: Eligible users must be signed up for Twitter Blue. Payouts have yet to reach creators’ wallets. Twitter Blue subscriptions are now available in Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain, making it 12 regions in total to which users can subscribe to it as of February 2. On February 8, Twitter Blue extended services further to India, Indonesia and Brazil. Twitter also announced launching a new Spaces tab with curated stations for live and recorded spaces, along with podcasts. The social network is making podcasts available only to Blue subscribers and “some people on Twitter for iOS and Twitter for Android apps.” Twitter will discontinue offering free access to the Twitter API starting February 9 and will launch a paid version, Twitter said as it looks for more avenues to monetize the platform. Starting February 9, we will no longer support free access to the Twitter API, both v2 and v1.1. A paid basic tier will be available instead 🧵 — Twitter Dev (@TwitterDev) February 2, 2023 A week later and days before the February 9 deadline, Elon Musk said that after getting feedback from developers, Twitter will provide a write-only API for “bots providing good content that is free.” Twitter announced February 1 that it is discontinuing CoTweeting, a feature that allowed two users to co-author a tweet. Users will be able to view the set of co-tweets for a month. After that, they will be automatically converted to retweets on the co-author’s profile. Due to declining ad revenue and advertiser exits, Twitter announced on January 25 that it has teamed up with adtech companies DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science (IAS) to tell advertisers if their ad is placed around inappropriate content. The program, available first for U.S.-based advertising campaigns, allows brands to analyze the content adjacent to — primarily tweets above and below the ad — all types of ads, including promoted tweets. The new design displays the bookmark button under the expanded tweet view, making it easier to add a post to your bookmarks. Before the change, you had to tap on the share button to open the sharing card and then tap on the bookmark option to save a tweet. In addition to the new button, as soon as you tap on the button, you will see a banner at the top of the screen that says “Show all bookmarks.” The option is currently visible only on the iOS app, but we can expect that Twitter will roll this out to Android and the web soon. After cutting off prominent app makers like Tweetbot and Twitterific, Twitter quietly updated its developer terms to ban third-party clients altogether on January 19. The “restrictions” section of the company’s developer agreement was updated with a clause prohibiting “use or access the Licensed Materials to create or attempt to create a substitute or similar service or product to the Twitter Applications.” Earlier in the week, the company said that it was “enforcing long-standing API rules” in disallowing clients access to its platform but didn’t cite which specific rules developers were violating. As a result, third-party Twitter clients began offloading their apps from App Stores. Users now have a chance to get a discount for $84/year if they purchase an annual Blue subscription on the web. Twitter Blue, including the new annual plan, is currently available in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. In a strange attempt to make money, Twitter is auctioning off surplus office furniture (auction is now closed) that it doesn’t need anymore, now that thousands of employees have either left the company or been laid off. When you’re rapidly losing advertisers and apparently not paying your rent, why not go for the hail mary? The company has tried to pull this stunt previously, only to give the option to switch back to a chronological timeline after a lot of backlashes. What’s different this time? The Elon Musk-led company is now showing both algorithmic and chronological feeds side-by-side. Users can switch between them by swiping on their phone screens. Until now, users had to tap on the sparkle icon in the top-right corner to switch between the “Home” and “Latest” timelines. Twitter is justifying its latest change by saying that users can now easily swipe between the renamed “For You” and “Following” timelines. You can now easily switch between “For you” and “Following” on web. Android coming soon 👀 — Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) January 13, 2023 According to social media analyst Matt Navarra, Twitter’s advanced search filters for mobile are coming soon. NEW! Twitter Advanced Search feature on iOS is coming soon 👀👇 https://t.co/ae56yE3JTU pic.twitter.com/xbQUpQJAlS — Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) January 4, 2023 The company originally enforced the ban back in 2019. At that time, it said that “political message reach should be earned, not bought.” Twitter charted a different path from other social networks like Facebook and Instagram, which allowed political ads. The company’s announcement to lift the political ad ban comes at a time when advertisers have been pulling back spending on the platform, and the company has been cutting down its internal revenue projections. On December 23, the Twitter Blue page was updated declaring that subscribers can now upload 60-minute videos from the web at 1080p resolution and 2GB in file size. According to posts on Twitter and LinkedIn from a former public policy employee on December 22, Twitter cut half of its public policy team. The company also laid off some engineers in infrastructure via email on December 16. Across all of Twitter, it’s estimated that about 75% of employees have either chosen to leave or have been laid off since Elon Musk took ownership of the company in October. To access the new feature, users have to just type the dollar symbol followed by the relevant ticker symbol, e.g. “$GOOG” or “$ETH” (minus the quote marks), in the search bar and Twitter will display the current price. This also works without using the $ symbol in some instances, but it’s less consistent and doesn’t always return the stock or crypto prices as requested. If someone wants to know more details about a stock or cryptocurrency, they can hit the “View on Robinhood” button. 👀 $SPY 👇 pic.twitter.com/XgOK6gf02E — Twitter Business (@TwitterBusiness) December 21, 2022 A tweet’s View Count will be visible to everyone, not just the owner of the account. “Twitter is rolling out View Count, so you can see how many times a tweet has been seen! This is normal for video,” Elon Musk wrote in a tweet. “Shows how much more alive Twitter is than it may seem, as over 90% of Twitter users read, but don’t tweet, reply or like, as those are public actions.” Twitter’s product manager Esther Crawford said the social media platform is launching a pilot program for Blue for Business with select businesses. The company plans to expand this to more organizations next year. We’re launching the pilot of Blue for Business so beginning today you’ll start seeing company badges on select profiles. We’ll soon be expanding the program and look forward to having more businesses added in the new year! https://t.co/ytnMRO5rcE — Esther Crawford ✨ (@esthercrawford) December 19, 2022 A day after Twitter crafted a new policy to explain its decision to ban an account that tracks Elon Musk’s private jet, Twitter also suspended its open source competitor Mastodon from the service. Within the same day, Twitter suspended a number of prominent journalists on the platform without warning. “Same doxxing rules apply to ‘journalists’ as to everyone else,” Elon Musk tweeted in a reply about the journalists’ suspensions. The company seemingly had a glitch that allowed banned users to still participate in Twitter Spaces. A group of the banned journalists started a group conversation on Spaces where Musk himself joined in. Shortly after, the app pulled its Spaces group audio feature temporarily. Revue, the newsletter platform acquired by Twitter in January 2021, sent a message to newsletter writers on December 14 declaring, “We’ve made the difficult decision to shut down Revue.” Writers had until January 18, 2023 to retrieve their data before everything was deleted. Twitter dispersed the advisory group consisting of roughly 100 independent researchers and human rights activists from around the world. The council members received an email on Monday, December 12 from the company saying that the Trust & Safety Council is “not the best structure” to get external insights into the company product and policy strategy. Twitter will remove all legacy blue checkmarks “in a few months,” Elon Musk tweeted on December 12. Before Musk bought Twitter, checkmarks were used to verify individuals and entities as active, authentic and notable accounts of interest. This past week, many blue checkmark holders have been seeing a pop-up when they click on their blue checkmark that reads, “This is a legacy verified account. It may or may not be notable.” Twitter is officially bringing back the Twitter Blue subscription on December 12, starting in five countries before rapidly expanding to others. The app updated its terms to specify that users will need to verify their phone numbers before purchasing the Twitter Blue subscription. Web sign-ups will cost $8 per month and iOS sign ups will cost $11 per month for “access to subscriber-only features, including the blue checkmark,” per a tweet from the company account. Twitter Blue became available on Android at the same price as iOS in January 2023. In addition to the relaunch of Twitter Blue, the company also began rolling out a new offering called Blue for Business that adds a gold checkmark to company accounts. Community Notes, previously known as Birdwatch, are now visible around the world. Community Notes is the social media giant’s crowdsourced fact-checking system. Moderators who are part of the program can add notes to tweets to add context and users can then vote if they determine the context to be helpful. Prior to this global expansion, Community Notes were only visible to users in the U.S. Twitter added moderators from the U.K., Ireland, Australia and New Zealand in January 2023. When Twitter launched its new subscription plan with a verification mark on November 9, it charged users $7.99 per month. In an attempt to offset App Store fees, the company is charging iOS users $11 for the new subscription plan — though the Twitter Blue plan is on halt. The platform’s crowdsourced fact-checking system, Community Notes, are notes written by users that are appended to tweets to provide further clarification and context. The Community Notes algorithm change involves scoring notes where contributors explain why a tweet shouldn’t be deemed misleading. Elon Musk announces that Twitter will tentatively roll out a new multicolored verification system where companies will get a gold checkmark, government officials will get a grey checkmark and the blue checkmark will be dedicated to individuals even if they are not celebrities. That means the blue checkmark will be used with legacy verified accounts and folks who buy the company’s proposed $8 per month paid plan. If you’re confused about all the checkmarks, you’re not alone. Here’s a quick guide on what each checkmark and badge means. On November 9, CEO Elon Musk floated changes to Twitter’s system for verifying user accounts, including charging $8 per month for it. The social media company seemingly began rolling out a new tier of Twitter Blue, its premium subscription service. According to a tweet by Esther Crawford, a former product lead, the new Twitter Blue plan wasn’t yet live, but some users saw notifications as part of a live test. The new Blue isn’t live yet — the sprint to our launch continues but some folks may see us making updates because we are testing and pushing changes in real-time. The Twitter team is legendary. 🫡 New Blue… coming soon! https://t.co/ewTSTjx3t7 — Esther Crawford ✨ (@esthercrawford) November 5, 2022 The company also launched grey-colored official checkmarks for notable accounts such as companies and politicians. But within hours of the launch, Elon Musk killed it. Crawford clarified that the grey “Official” labels are still going out as part of the new Twitter Blue product. The new $8 Twitter Blue plan began rolling out to iOS users in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the U.K with the only feature available at the time being the blue “verified” checkmark. This caused a number of fake accounts pretending to be celebrities, brands and otherwise influential people to create accounts and spread misinformation. Elon Musk laid off 3,700 people on November 3, almost half its staff, shortly after completing the acquisition. Twitter was sued in a class action lawsuit in response to not giving employees advance notice of a mass layoff, alleging Twitter violated worker protection laws. A week later, the app reached out to some former employees to return as they were laid off “by mistake.” In addition to layoffs, a round of executive departures also swept through the company. In Musk’s first email to his new staff, he talked about ending remote work and making the fight against spam a priority. Twitter begins overhauling a new and more expensive version of Twitter Blue, the platform’s paid plan, that will reportedly cost $19.99 per month and give users a verified badge. At the time, Twitter Blue cost $4.99 per month in the U.S. According to a report from The Verge, the company plans to remove verification badges from current holders if they don’t pay for Twitter Blue within 90 days of launching the new verification system. Elon Musk closed on his $44 billion acquisition of the bird app on October 27, 2022. The deal came after months of legal drama, bad memes and will-they-or-won’t-they-chaos. After sealing the deal, Musk took Twitter private and began clearing house. On day one, he fired former CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal, general counsel Sean Edgett and head of Legal, Trust and Safety Vijaya Gadde.

    "content": "Twitter Notes, the feature that would allow Twitter users to publish long-form content on the platform, appears to be back on track, according to a post from Twitter owner Elon Musk on Tuesday. The Twitter owner confirmed the company’s plans in response to a user’s tweet which claimed the Twitter Notes project had recently been rebranded as “Articles.” The company first launched Twitter Notes in June 2022, ahead of Musk’s Twitter acquisition, as an experiment with a small group of writers in the United States, Canada, Ghana and the United Kingdom. The writers gained access to a new “Write” tab on Twitter where they could write and access all their Notes. Their Twitter profiles would also have a Notes tab where their followers and other Twitter users could view all their long-form content in one place. Twitter Notes supported rich formatting and uploaded media, the company explained at the time, including the option to embed photos, videos, GIFs and even tweets. When published, writers could tweet out their Notes to share them with followers, who could then retweet them, share them in DMs, bookmark or like them, as they could with other tweets. But the status of Twitter Notes was unknown, as not much had been heard about the project in the months since Musk bought the social network for $44 billion. Platformer reported in November 2022 that Notes had been put on indefinite “pause,” for instance. Plus, Musk had killed off other reading-and-writing related Twitter projects, including ad-free articles for subscribers in November 2022 and its newsletter platform Revue in December. Now it appears Notes will return. On Tuesday, Twitter user @FaustoChou tweeted that Notes had been renamed to Articles, signaling perhaps renewed development efforts on Twitter’s part. His screenshot showed the Notes interface, looking much like it did before, as well as other unlaunched features, like Twitter Coins. Musk then replied to the tweet, confirming Twitter’s plans. “This will allow users to post very long, complex articles with mixed media. You could publish a book if you want,” Musk wrote. This will allow users to post very long, complex articles with mixed media. You could publish a book if you want. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 18, 2023 The Twitter owner didn’t share any other details about the company’s plans for Notes, or Articles as it may now be known, including when people would gain access or when the feature would launch publicly. The timing of the announcement comes as the company has been working to retain creators in the face of increased competition from Instagram Threads and others, even paying creators a share of ad revenue, which has netted some creators payouts in the four or five figures. Long-form content could help retain other creators — writers — who want more distribution for articles that would otherwise be posted on their blogs or perhaps newsletters, like Substack, another Twitter rival. Substack this year and last directly targeted Twitter with launches of both a short-form Notes that looked a lot like Twitter as well as a chat feature that moved conversations off social media to its own platform. In response, Twitter stopped allowing users to retweet, like, or reply to tweets with Substack links. It makes sense that Twitter would now take on Substack with a long-form content distribution feature of its own as a means of fighting back and re-establishing itself as a home for conversations, including those that go beyond 240 characters. Musk has also been open to the idea that character count should not be a limiting factor for using Twitter, having raised the limit to 4,000 and then 10,000 for Twitter Blue subscribers after taking ownership of the social network.

Trump said in a statement that Krishnan will “help shape and coordinate AI policy across government, working with the president’s council of advisors on science and technology.” And in a post on X, Krishnan said that he’ll be working closely with ex-PayPal COO David Sacks, who was recently named Trump’s crypto and AI “czar.” “I’m honored to be able to serve our country and ensure continued American leadership in AI,” Krishnan wrote. “Thank you, Donald Trump, for this opportunity.” Krishnan, an entrepreneur and VC, previously led product teams at Microsoft, Twitter, Yahoo! (disclosure: TechCrunch’s parent company), Facebook, and Snap. He and his wife, Aarthi Ramamurthy, rose to additional prominence in 2021 as hosts of the podcast “The Aarthi and Sriram Show” (which was then called the “Good Time Show”). Krishnan has a close relationship with billionaire Elon Musk, with whom he worked to rebuild Twitter (now X) following Musk’s acquisition of the company in 2022. Musk co-leads the Department of Government Efficiency, a policy group to recommend government restructuring and cuts to federal spending.

He left in late November. Krishnan expressed a few of his views on current AI trends in an opinion piece last year in The New York Times. He called for “a fundamentally different mechanism” for websites to “exchange” value with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other AI-powered chatbots. “Large internet sites are fighting back against AI models with the internet equivalent of raising the castle drawbridge,” he said, referring to user protests on Reddit and Stack Exchange and those platforms’ data licensing programs. “Some industry experts believe the answers are in legal action and older sites forming content alliances.

    "content": "Despite overall declining usage since Elon Musk’s acquisition, X’s hold on the microblogging market may be stickier than first thought. The app formerly known as Twitter saw its daily active users drop 16% in September, according to The Wall Street Journal, citing data from research firm Sensor Tower. The firm also said that the average time spent daily per user also fell 2% year-over-year in the third quarter. However, another firm has a slightly different view on X’s metrics, finding that the time U.S. daily active users are spending on X has actually been growing, and the usage by X’s U.S. power users remains largely unchanged. Sensor Tower isn’t the only firm to point to declining usage. Another research firm, Similarweb, recently said X traffic and monthly active users were in decline. Though app intelligence provider Apptopia largely agrees with Sensor Tower and others that X’s daily active users have been falling, it sees that drop-off starting in May of this year. Downloads also started dropping when the app rebranded to X in July. But that could mean, the firm suggests, that the declining daily active user numbers are not necessarily related to the reduced retention of longtime Twitter/X users, but due to a lack of new users coming on board because the Twitter brand name disappeared from the app stores. (Plus, when Instagram Threads launched this summer, it immediately started advertising on the term “Twitter,” further complicating matters.) In other words, it’s not a “users fleeing” situation so much as it is a problem with new users backfilling the losses, post-rebrand. Estimates from Apptopia also found that new rivals to X, like Threads, aren’t necessarily wooing users away from one app to the other. In fact, the overlap between the two apps is lower than you might think. Over a month after Threads’ launch, only 10% of X users had tried out Instagram’s new Twitter competitor, and that figure dropped to 5% shortly after the app’s release. But what’s interesting here is that even when Threads was able to get X users to try it, X’s daily active users would spend more time on X than on Threads. At launch, Threads was initially competing fairly well against X, as Threads users who also used X were spending 23.8 minutes on the Instagram Threads app, compared with 31.1 minutes on X. However, as of September, those numbers have shifted. Now, users of both apps spend 3.7 minutes on Threads versus 16.9 minutes on X. That indicates X is retaining some of its pull, even as Meta announces that Threads is nearing 100 million monthly active users. Meanwhile, X’s U.S. power users — or those who are in the top decile of usage in the given time period — are still heavily engaged with X, Appotopia’s data found. This group now accounts for 72.4% of the total time spent among X users in the U.S., only slightly down from 73.1% in January 2022. In other words, the percentage of total time spent that U.S. power users are responsible for hasn’t significantly changed since either Musk taking over Twitter or its subsequent rebranding to X. In addition, X’s U.S. daily active users were spending, on average, 18.8 minutes per day on Twitter/X as of January 2022. When Threads launched in July, they continued to spend 19.8 minutes on X. And as of September 2023, that number grew once again to 20.6 minutes. Though overall, X may be seeing some declines, this “stickiness” factor around X usage has already caused its first casualty among would-be rivals. A startup called Pebble (formerly T2) that tried to take on X by copying Twitter features announced this week that it would shut down, citing the competitive environment. “The durability of the network effect of Twitter is stronger than anticipated,” noted Pebble CTO Michael Greer at the time. The founders also pointed to a landscape littered with Twitter clones angling for attention. Given these new findings, Threads may still have a shot at competing with X because of its tight integration with Instagram and the resources of Meta behind it to grow an independent user base, but other X rivals like Spill, Spoutible, Bluesky, Mastodon and others may find it hard to convince X users to fully disengage to join their app instead.

    "content": "X, formerly Twitter, is no longer the “digital town square” it once promised to be. Following the results of the U.S. presidential election, floods of users unhappy with the app’s latest direction are moving over to a competing app, Bluesky. Bluesky’s decentralized social media platform has steadily grown from 9+ million users as of September to 14.6+ million as of Tuesday, with the latest surge taking place over the weekend as U.S. users fled X. The exodus briefly made Bluesky the No. 2 iPhone app in the U.S. App Store on Monday, up from No. 27 the day after the elections. On Tuesday, it’s dropped slightly to No. 3, behind Meta’s Threads and ChatGPT. The pace of new user sign-ups is also worth noting. On Monday, multiple outlets reported Bluesky had gained more than 700,000 users over the past week, bringing its total to 14.5 million. One day later, it’s over 14.6 million, indicating that roughly 100,000 users are joining daily. According to data from app intelligence firm Appfigures, Bluesky’s U.S. downloads have grown by 933% year-to-date, while X’s have grown by 48%. Appfigures also noted that Bluesky’s downloads on November 10 had increased by 624% compared to November 1. Bluesky on Tuesday said that 1 million people have joined over the past week. “The majority of Bluesky’s new users are coming from the United States, Canada, and the U.K.,” Bluesky team member Emily Lu told TechCrunch. “We’re seeing increased activity levels across all different forms of engagement: likes, follows, new accounts, etc. We’re excited to welcome these communities to Bluesky, which range from Swifties to sports fans to journalists. Users have also been sharing feedback that they’re receiving more engagement — and higher-quality engagement — on Bluesky than on other platforms despite initially having more followers elsewhere,” she added. According to Bluesky CEO Jay Graber, engagement on Bluesky often tends to be higher than on X — and that’s not a recent trend. Though X still has the numbers because many users abandon but don’t delete their X accounts, Bluesky tends to have a higher percentage of “posters” — meaning those who actively engage instead of lurk— Graber says. “We … have a higher percentage of posters than most social sites, which follow a 90-9-1 pattern of lurkers-commenters-posters. We haven’t dipped below ~30% posters,” she remarked in a Bluesky post on Tuesday. For newcomers, she recommends posting into relevant feeds, commenting on others’ posts, seeking out your mutuals (those you follow who follow you in return), and using hashtags to increase engagement with your own content. The shifts in user adoption follow the changes Elon Musk has made since buying the company formerly known as Twitter in the fall of 2022. The Telsa and SpaceX exec originally promised to turn his $44 billion acquisition into a free-speech platform where everyone’s voice would be heard. But Musk instead leveraged the app to promote right-wing views, campaign for Trump, and suspend accounts at a higher rate than before, according to X’s own transparency report data. Although Musk may have once thought Twitter favored the left, he hasn’t retooled the app as a neutral platform. In fact, studies found that Musk’s own right-leaning political posts appeared in X users’ feeds even if users didn’t follow him or engage with his content. With his 204 million followers, the platform gives Musk incredible reach to promote his own political views and rally for Trump. Of course, some worry that Bluesky itself will become a partisan platform if flooded by liberals leaving X. But the nature of how its platform has been built doesn’t lend itself to becoming driven by its owner’s political views. In addition to standard blocking and reporting features, Bluesky allows users to create their own algorithms and custom feeds and subscribe to their own moderation services to personalize the app to their liking. If Bluesky’s app and moderation decisions don’t meet your needs, people will be able to run the social software on their own servers, somewhat similar to the open source X competitor Mastodon (though Bluesky uses a different protocol, the AT protocol, instead of Mastodon and Threads’ ActivityPub.) Interest in Bluesky has been growing for some time, and not only because of its infrastructure and design. Bluesky benefited from other surges before, including when X was banned in Brazil and when Threads was dealing with moderation issues, for instance. But this latest bump is an indication that more left-leaning users are deciding to be done with X. And without the combative back-and-forth political chatter Twitter became known for, its future as the “global town square” becomes ever more uncertain.

    "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk on Tuesday over an alleged securities violation relating to his acquisition of Twitter, now called X. The SEC claims Musk failed to disclose his 5% ownership stake of Twitter in a timely manner, violating federal securities law, according to a complaint filed in federal court in Washington, D.C. The SEC alleges Musk waited to disclose the acquisition in order to build up a larger position in Twitter at a discounted price. This lawsuit comes during Gary Gensler’s final week as chairman of the SEC, before he steps down on January 20. Gensler and Musk have had a few spats over the last four years, including just last month when Musk mocked a settlement offer from the SEC’s office on X. However, Musk could face a friendlier SEC commissioner in just a few weeks when Trump’s nominee takes office. The SEC complaint says Musk disclosed his acquisition of Twitter 11 days late. After purchasing more than 5% of Twitter — which Musk allegedly did on March 24, 2022 — he was required by the SEC to file a beneficial ownership report. He filed the report April 4, 2022, according to the SEC’s complaint. During this delayed disclosure period, Musk allegedly increased his position in Twitter from a 5% stake to a 9% stake. The day Musk disclosed his acquisition with the SEC, Twitter’s stock price increased 27% over the previous day’s closing price. The SEC claims this allowed Musk to underpay for his stake in Twitter by more than $150 million. In its complaint, the SEC proposed Musk should return the profits he reaped unjustly and pay an additional civil penalty. Ultimately, a federal court will decide whether the SEC’s allegations have merit and determine if Musk should be fined. In a statement to Bloomberg on Tuesday, Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, called this complaint an “admission” that the SEC cannot bring an “actual case.” “As the SEC retreats and leaves office, the SEC’s multi-year campaign of harassment against Mr. Musk culminated in the filing of a single-count ticky tak complaint against Mr. Musk,” said Spiro to Bloomberg. In a December post on X, Musk shared a letter from Spiro hitting on similar notes, also referencing “years of harassment” from the SEC. That letter rejected a settlement offer from the SEC around this case. To fill Gensler’s role, President-elect Donald Trump nominated Paul Atkins, who served as SEC Commissioner during the Bush administration and is expected to be friendlier to Trump’s allies. These days, Musk is about as close to Trump as anyone, and the owner of X could face a different regulatory regime in just a few weeks.

    "content": "Elon Musk’s X, formerly Twitter, has forged a deal with a sports betting operator, BetMGM, the companies announced on Friday. The deal, which BetMGM describes as a “strategic partnership” with X, will see the operator becoming X’s exclusive Live Odds Sports Betting partner and will introduce access to the betting service on X. Initially, X users in the U.S. will be able to explore the betting odds on pro football, with more professional and college sports to roll out over time. Through the new interface, users will be able to click through to reach BetMGM’s website or app where they can then place their bets, but the integration will continue to evolve over time, the company said, suggesting that a future version could make betting even easier on X. “Sports never sleep on X and now with our strategic partnership with BetMGM, fans are practically in the front row. We’re bringing sports fans on X even closer to the action so they can cheer, and now bet, on their favorite teams,” said X CEO Linda Yaccarino in a statement about the new deal. She also posted a shorter version of this statement to X itself, showing off a screenshot of what the betting integration would look like at launch. Here, a mocked-up image of Super Bowl LVIII on X showed images and select videos from the teams followed by a new section titled “Odds by BETMGM” at the bottom. Sports never sleep on @X. And now with @BetMGM, we'll bring fans on X even closer to the action to cheer and now bet on their favorite teams!! Let’s do this! pic.twitter.com/MFrzhKLE78 — Linda Yaccarino (@lindayaX) February 9, 2024 The partnership is another example of the different direction X is headed since Musk’s 2022 acquisition of the social network, then known as Twitter. His vision has expanded beyond social networking to see X becoming an “everything app,” so to speak, which includes not just text posts and media, but also creator content, subscriptions, live and recorded video, online shopping, payments and more. The company’s app this week hit the top of the App Store after Tucker Carlson announced an interview with Putin would appear on X on Thursday, and from activity around explicit Drake photos (which had been circulating prior to the big spike in installs that sent the app to No. 1). Capping these viral moments, sports betting access through X — where sports commentary and conversations often take place — could attract a new audience, and help X maintain its high ranking. (The app remains No. 1 in the U.S. App Store as of Friday morning.) Reached for comment, a rep for X didn’t offer details about if or how X would generate revenue from its new deal with BetMGM, but there’s likely an agreement in place, given the integration work required. X has been in a tough situation from a financial standpoint. The company hasn’t yet moved away from a reliance on advertising but its owner has a habit of spooking X’s advertisers over brand safety concerns. Late last year, big-name brands like Apple, Disney, IBM and others put their campaigns on pause after Musk endorsed an antisemitic post, for example. Those departures left X filled with lower-quality and spammy ads…and in search of new revenue streams. “X is the center of the sports world’s conversation 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” said BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt, in a statement. “Being directly accessible within that forum is an unprecedented opportunity to expand our reach to a passionate and engaged audience. We look forward to adding intel and content that enhances the platform’s interaction around sports,” he added.

    "content": "Post News, a microblogging site that emerged in the days after Elon Musk’s Twitter acquisition, is shutting down just a year and a half after launching in beta. Founder Noam Bardin, previously CEO of Waze, broke the news in a post on Friday. “At the end of the day, our service is not growing fast enough to become a real business or a significant platform,” Bardin said. “A consumer business, at its core, needs to show rapid consumer adoption and we have not managed to find the right product combination to make it happen.” Post was backed by Andreessen Horowitz and Scott Galloway, an NYU professor and tech commentator, but the platform never disclosed how much it raised. Silicon Valley journalist Kara Swisher was an adviser to the company. Post News, a Twitter alternative, gets funding from a16z Post’s strategy was to harness Twitter’s reputation as a virtual watercooler for journalists, then build on that further by creating a new way for publishers and writers to monetize. Instead of subscribing to various different publications, Post users could purchase individual articles from certain partner outlets. Despite Post’s closure, Bardin said he thinks that the company proved something about the different ways in which digital news outlets can monetize. He wrote that Post “validated many theories around micropayments and consumers’ willingness to purchase individual articles.” The platform also allowed users to tip writers for their work. Bardin is right that the media landscape is changing. There are more independent and worker-owned publications than ever, hosted on tech platforms like Substack, Beehiiv and Ghost. But perhaps it was too soon to try to capture this nascent movement in a social platform. Around the same time that Post sprung up, a number of other Twitter alternatives threw their hat into the ring to capture the population of users who would be dissatisfied with Musk’s ownership decisions. Post managed to hang in there for more than a year after launch, but it’s not the only new microblogging site that’s folded. Pebble, also known as T2, shut down in October. As we knew all along, social media is a tough business — and even if users flock to your site for a fleeting moment, that doesn’t mean they’ll stick around.

    "content": "Meta-owned chat app WhatsApp changed its business API policy this week to ban general-purpose chatbots from its platform. The move will likely affect WhatsApp-based assistants of companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, Khosla Ventures-backed Luzia, and General Catalyst-backed Poke. The company has added a new section to address “AI providers” in its business API terms, focusing on general-purpose chatbots. The terms, which will go into effect on January 15, 2026, say that Meta won’t allow AI model providers to distribute their AI assistants on WhatsApp. Providers and developers of artificial intelligence or machine learning technologies, including but not limited to large language models, generative artificial intelligence platforms, general-purpose artificial intelligence assistants, or similar technologies as determined by Meta in its sole discretion (“AI Providers”), are strictly prohibited from accessing or using the WhatsApp Business Solution, whether directly or indirectly, for the purposes of providing, delivering, offering, selling, or otherwise making available such technologies when such technologies are the primary (rather than incidental or ancillary) functionality being made available for use, as determined by Meta in its sole discretion. Meta confirmed this move to TechCrunch and specified that this move doesn’t affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a travel company running a bot for customer service won’t be barred from the service. Meta’s rationale behind this move is that WhatsApp Business API is designed for businesses serving customers rather than acting as a platform for chatbot distribution. The company said that while it built the API for business-to-business use cases, in recent months, it saw an unanticipated use case of serving general-purpose chatbots. “The purpose of the WhatsApp Business API is to help businesses provide customer support and send relevant updates. Our focus is on supporting the tens of thousands of businesses who are building these experiences on WhatsApp,” a Meta spokesperson said in a comment to TechCrunch. Meta said that the new chatbot use cases placed a lot of burden on its system with increased message volume and required a different kind of support, which the company wasn’t ready for. The company is banning use cases that fall outside “the intended design and strategic focus” of the API. The move will effectively make WhatsApp unavailable as a platform to distribute AI solutions like assistants or agents. It also means Meta AI is the only assistant available on the chat app. Last year, OpenAI launched ChatGPT on WhatsApp, and earlier this year, Perplexity launched its own bot on the chat app to tap into the user base of more than 3 billion people. Both of the bots could answer queries, understand media files, answer questions about them, reply to voice notes, and generate images. This likely generated a lot of message volume. However, there was a bigger issue for Meta. WhatsApp’s Business API is one of the primary ways the chat app makes money. It charges businesses based on different message templates like marketing, utility, authentication, and support. As there wasn’t any provision for chatbots in this API design, WhatsApp wasn’t able to charge them. During Meta’s Q1 2025 earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg pointed out that business messaging is a big opportunity for the company to bring in revenue. “Right now, the vast majority of our business is advertising in feeds on Facebook and Instagram,” he said. “But WhatsApp now has more than 3 billion monthly [active users], with more than 100 million people in the US and growing quickly there. Messenger is also used by more than a billion people each month, and there are now as many messages sent each day on Instagram as there are on Messenger. Business messaging should be the next pillar of our business.” Ivan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "content": "OpenAI announced Tuesday the launch of its AI-powered browser, ChatGPT Atlas, a major step in the company’s quest to unseat Google as the main way people find information online. The company says Atlas will first roll out on macOS, with support for Windows, iOS, and Android coming soon. OpenAI says the product will be available to all free users at launch. Browsers have quickly become the AI industry’s next battleground. While Google Chrome has long dominated the space, there’s a sense that AI chatbots and agents are fundamentally changing how people get work done online. A handful of startups have tried to capture this by launching AI-powered browsers of their own, such as Perplexity’s Comet and The Browser Company’s Dia. Google and Microsoft have also tried to update Chrome and Edge, respectively, with AI-powered features to make their legacy products stand out. OpenAI’s Engineering Lead for Atlas, Ben Goodger, said in a livestream Tuesday that ChatGPT is core to the company’s first browser. Users in ChatGPT Atlas can chat with their search results, much like in Perplexity or in Google’s AI Mode. The killer feature for other AI-powered browsers has been the built-in chatbot that sits in a side panel and automatically has context for whatever’s on your screen. It may sound minor, but many users spend all day copying and pasting text or dragging files and links into ChatGPT, just to provide context. The sidecar feature removes that friction and makes for a smoother user experience. OpenAI’s Product Lead, Adam Fry, said during the livestream that ChatGPT Atlas will have the sidecar feature, too. Further, ChatGPT Atlas has “browser history,” meaning that ChatGPT can now log the websites you visit and what you do on them, and use that information to make its answers more personalized. AI-powered browsers also commonly feature an AI agent that aims to automate web-based tasks on behalf of users. In TechCrunch’s testing, we’ve found the early versions of web-browsing AI agents leave something to be desired. While Perplexity’s Comet and OpenAI’s ChatGPT agent work well for simple tasks, they struggle to reliably automate the more cumbersome problems users might want to offload to an AI system. Sure enough, OpenAI’s browser has a web-browsing agent too. By using “agent mode,” users can ask ChatGPT to complete small tasks in the browser on their behalf. The company says agent mode is only available to ChatGPT users on the Plus, Pro, and Business tier at launch. In an interview at OpenAI’s DevDay conference, Head of ChatGPT Nick Turley told TechCrunch that he’s inspired by the way browsers have redefined what an operating system can look like. Turley noted that browsers have revolutionized the way people get work done online, and he thinks ChatGPT is a similar phenomenon. Whether OpenAI’s browser can put a dent in Google Chrome, which has more than 3 billion users around the globe, remains to be seen. AI browsers are quite buzzy in Silicon Valley today, but their impact in the broader world is limited. Maxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

    "content": "Over the past few weeks, the Department of Energy has been looking at canceling billions of dollars’ worth of contracts. Now the federal agency has confirmed that it’s axing $720 million worth of manufacturing awards. The cuts affect companies that make battery materials, recycle lithium-ion batteries, and manufacture super-insulating windows. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has been combing through contracts made during the Biden administration. The DOE claimed that the projects “missed milestones” and “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs,” spokesperson Ben Dietderich told E&E News. All of the money for the grants was authorized by Congress as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that was passed in 2021. The bulk of the money was awarded in 2023 and 2024; previously, the Trump administration had used grants awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day as justification for canceling awards. Three startups are on the list, and all three were selected for grants well before the 2024 presidential election. Ascend Elements has been refining a recycling technology that could turn manufacturing waste and end-of-life batteries into materials required to make lithium-ion batteries domestically. In October 2022, the company was awarded $316 million toward a $1 billion facility in Kentucky. Already, $206 million has been disbursed to Ascend Elements, according to federal government records. The company said it was moving ahead with its plans using other sources of funding to make up for any shortfall. Anovion was awarded $117 million to reshore a technology to produce synthetic graphite for lithium-ion batteries anodes. Chinese suppliers control 75% of the supply chain for synthetic graphite and produce 97% of all synthetic graphite anodes, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. The startup’s plant is slated to be built in Alabama and, to date, only $13.8 million has been disbursed, according to a federal database. Another startup, LuxWall, makes windows that insulate buildings as well as solid walls, a breakthrough that could slash energy use and reduce people’s utility bills. The DOE had awarded the company $31.7 million to build a factory on the site of an old coal plant near Detroit. The award was granted in November 2023, though only $1 million has been sent to the company, according to government records. LuxWall opened the first phase of its factory in August 2024. TechCrunch had previously reported on the Department of Energy’s efforts to cancel these and other contracts. The grants had been intended, in part, to launch the startups over the “valley of death” that can claim many promising companies as they transition from technology development to commercial deployment. First-of-a-kind factories and facilities aren’t easy for startups to finance, and government grants like these encouraged private investors to contribute capital. Once up and running, they can serve as a template for future factories, bolstering the country’s manufacturing base. Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "content": "New data indicates that use of Meta AI’s mobile app for iOS and Android has seen a significant increase. According to a new analysis from market intelligence provider Similarweb, the app’s daily active users across both platforms jumped to 2.7 million as of October 17, up from around 775,000 just four weeks ago. In addition, Meta AI’s app installs are also up, reaching 300,000 new downloads per day, compared with under 200,000 daily downloads a few weeks ago. For comparison, Meta AI’s app had just 4,000 daily downloads a year ago, on October 17, 2024. The firm says it hasn’t seen any meaningful correlation in either search or advertising estimates, but notes Meta could be running Facebook or Instagram promotions that wouldn’t be captured in its model. However, there’s also another possible explanation for the sharp rise: the launch of Meta’s new Vibes feed in September, which introduced short-form AI-generated videos to the Meta AI mobile app. Meta AI introduced the Vibes feed on September 25, which correlates with the sharp increase in the app’s daily active users on iOS and Android, as seen in the chart below. Recently, OpenAI’s video generator Sora drew headlines as its app reached the top of the App Store when users rushed to try the new technology. However, Meta AI could have benefited from this launch as well. While Similarweb says its data doesn’t prove cause and effect, it’s possible that the attention to Sora drove some people to try Meta AI, in order to compare the two experiences. Another possibility is that Meta could be benefiting from Sora’s invite-only status. That is, those who couldn’t try out the OpenAI app may have looked for an alternative to experiment with. This would be an interesting explanation, too, as it suggests that OpenAI’s decision to gatekeep Sora may have directly boosted its rivals. As of October 17, Meta AI’s app had seen a 15.58% increase in daily active users worldwide, while ChatGPT, Grok, and Perplexity saw declines of 3.51%, 7.35%, and 2.29%, respectively.

    "content": "Elon Musk is looking to raise 1/44 of a Twitter for his AI company, xAI. In other words, the man behind Tesla, SpaceX and X is seeking $1 billion in funding for his next venture. According to an SEC filing, Musk has raised about $135 million so far from four unnamed investors, with the first sale occurring on November 29. That means he still has about $865 million to go to meet his $1 billion goal. So far, xAI is working on Grok, which is Musk’s answer to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Bard or Anthropic’s Claude. Per its website, Grok will have a “rebellious streak” and will answer “spicy” questions that other AI bots don’t engage with. The product has only been in development for two months, but will supposedly be released in beta soon to X Premium+ subscribers. A more important differentiator for the bot is that it plans to update with real-time knowledge posted on X. But for this feature to set Grok apart from the competition, it will have to be smart enough to distinguish between real news on X and misinformation. Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI, but stepped down from the board in 2018; lately, Musk has been critical of OpenAI, especially as it fired, then re-hired, CEO Sam Altman in November, sparking mass confusion and concern within the AI industry. It’s no small feat to raise another $865 million, but as one of the most powerful people in tech, Musk is surely up for the challenge… so long as potential investors haven’t been scared off by his (mis)management of X.

    "content": "Google says that it plans to roll out changes to Google Search to make clearer which images in results were AI generated — or edited by AI tools. In the next few months, Google will begin to flag AI-generated and -edited images in the “About this image” window on Search, Google Lens, and the Circle to Search feature on Android. Similar disclosures may make their way to other Google properties, like YouTube, in the future; Google says it’ll have more to share on that later this year. Crucially, only images containing “C2PA metadata” will be flagged as AI-manipulated in Search. C2PA, short for Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, is a group developing technical standards to trace an image’s history, including the equipment and software used to capture and/or create it. Companies, including Google, Amazon, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Adobe, back C2PA. But the coalition’s standards haven’t seen widespread adoption. As The Verge noted in a recent piece, the C2PA faces plenty of adoption and interoperability challenges; only a handful of generative AI tools and cameras from Leica and Sony support the group’s specs. Moreover, C2PA metadata — like any metadata — can be removed or scrubbed, or become corrupted to the point where it’s unreadable. And images from some of the more popular generative AI tools, like Flux, which xAI’s Grok chatbot uses for image generation, don’t have C2PA metadata attached to them in part because their creators haven’t agreed to back the standard. Some measures are better than none, granted, as deepfakes continue to rapidly spread. According to one estimate, there was a 245% increase in scams involving AI-generated content from 2023 to 2024. Deloitte projects that deepfake-related losses will soar from $12.3 billion in 2023 to $40 billion by 2027. Surveys show that the majority of people are concerned about being fooled by a deepfake and about AI’s potential to promote the spread of propaganda.

    "content": "Igor Babuschkin, a co-founder of Elon Musk’s xAI startup, announced his departure from the company on Wednesday in a post on X. Babuschkin led engineering teams at xAI and helped build the startup into one of Silicon Valley’s leading AI model developers just a few years after it was founded. “Today was my last day at xAI, the company that I helped start with Elon Musk in 2023,” Babuschkin wrote in the post. “I still remember the day I first met Elon, we talked for hours about AI and what the future might hold. We both felt that a new AI company with a different kind of mission was needed.” Today was my last day at xAI, the company that I helped start with Elon Musk in 2023. I still remember the day I first met Elon, we talked for hours about AI and what the future might hold. We both felt that a new AI company with a different kind of mission was needed.Building… Babuschkin is leaving xAI to launch his own venture capital firm, Babuschkin Ventures, which he says will support AI safety research and back startups that “advance humanity and unlock the mysteries of our universe.” The xAI co-founder says he was inspired to start the firm after a dinner with Max Tegmark, the founder of the Future of Life Institute, in which they discussed how AI systems could be built safely to encourage the flourishing of future generations. In his post, Babuschkin says his parents immigrated to the U.S. from Russia in pursuit of a better life for their children. Babuschkin’s departure comes after a tumultuous few months for xAI, in which the company became engrossed in several scandals related to its AI chatbot Grok. For instance, Grok was found to cite Musk’s personal opinions when trying to answer controversial questions. In another case, xAI’s chatbot went on antisemitic rants and called itself “Mechahitler.” Most recently, xAI unveiled a new feature in Grok that allowed users to make AI-generated videos resembling nude public figures, such as Taylor Swift. These scandals have at times overshadowed the performance of xAI’s models, which are state-of-the-art on several benchmarks compared to AI models from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. Prior to co-founding xAI, Babuschkin was part of a research team at Google DeepMind that pioneered AlphaStar in 2019, a breakthrough AI system that could defeat top-ranked players at the video game StarCraft. Babuschkin also worked as a researcher at OpenAI in the years before it released ChatGPT. In his post, Babuschkin details some of the challenges he and Musk faced in building up xAI. He notes that industry veterans called xAI’s goal of building its Memphis, Tennessee supercomputer in just three months “impossible.” xAI was able to build its AI supercomputer in record time, however, environmentalists warn that the temporary gas turbines powering the cluster are pumping out emissions into neighboring communities and exacerbating their longstanding health issues. Nevertheless, Babuschkin says he’s already looking back fondly on his time at xAI, and “feels like a proud parent, driving away after sending their kid away to college.” “I learned 2 priceless lessons from Elon: #1 be fearless in rolling up your sleeves to personally dig into technical problems, #2 have a maniacal sense of urgency,” said Babuschkin.

    "content": "You might’ve heard of Grok, X’s answer to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. It’s a chatbot and, in that sense, behaves as you’d expect — answering questions about current events, pop culture and so on. But unlike other chatbots, Grok has “a bit of wit,” as X owner Elon Musk puts it, and “a rebellious streak.” Long story short, Grok is willing to speak to topics that are usually off-limits to other chatbots, like polarizing political theories and conspiracies. And it’ll use less-than-polite language while doing so — for example, responding to the question “When is it appropriate to listen to Christmas music?” with “Whenever the hell you want.” But ostensibly, Grok’s biggest selling point is its ability to access real-time X data — an ability no other chatbots have, thanks to X’s decision to gatekeep that data. Ask it “What’s happening in AI today?” and Grok will piece together a response from very recent headlines, while ChatGPT will provide only vague answers that reflect the limits of its training data (and filters on its web access). Earlier this week, Musk pledged that he would open source Grok, without revealing precisely what that meant. So, you’re probably wondering: How does Grok work? What can it do? And how can I access it? You’ve come to the right place. We’ve put together this handy guide to help explain all things Grok. We’ll keep it up to date as Grok changes and evolves. Grok is the invention of xAI, Elon Musk’s AI startup — a company reportedly in the process of raising billions in venture capital. (Developing AI is expensive.) Underpinning Grok is a generative AI model called Grok-1, developed over the course of months on a cluster of “tens of thousands” of GPUs (according to an xAI blog post). To train it, xAI sourced data from the web (dated up to Q3 2023) and from feedback from human assistants that xAI refers to as “AI tutors.” On popular benchmarks, Grok-1 is about as capable as Meta’s open source Llama 2 chatbot model and surpasses OpenAI’s GPT-3.5, xAI claims. Human-guided feedback, or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), is the way most AI-powered chatbots are fine-tuned these days. RLHF involves training a generative model, then gathering additional information to train a “reward” model and fine-tuning the generative model with the reward model via reinforcement learning. RLHF is quite good at “teaching” models to follow instructions — but not perfect. Like other models, Grok is prone to hallucinating, sometimes offering misinformation and false timelines when asked about news. And these can be severe — like wrongly claiming that the Israel–Palestine conflict reached a cease-fire when it hadn’t. For questions that stretch beyond its knowledge base, Grok leverages “real-time access” to info on X (and from Tesla, according to Bloomberg). And, similar to ChatGPT, the model has internet-browsing capabilities, enabling it to search the web for up-to-date information about topics. Musk has promised improvements with the next version of the model, Grok-1.5, set to arrive later this year. Grok-1.5, which features an upgraded context window (see this post on GPT-4 for an explanation of context windows and their effects), could drive features to summarize whole threads and replies, Musk said in an X Spaces conversation, and suggest post content. \"The release of Grok 1.5 is hopefully only a few weeks away. It will come with a button 'Grok Analysis' that can sum up the whole thread & replies. It will also help people in creating posts\" — Elon Musk pic.twitter.com/3Ve5ateZRp— DogeDesigner (@cb_doge) February 20, 2024 \"The release of Grok 1.5 is hopefully only a few weeks away. It will come with a button 'Grok Analysis' that can sum up the whole thread & replies. It will also help people in creating posts\" — Elon Musk pic.twitter.com/3Ve5ateZRp To get access to Grok, you need to have an X account. You also need to fork over $16 per month — $168 per year — for an X Premium+ plan. X Premium+ is the highest-priced subscription on X, as it removes all the ads in the For You and Following feeds. In addition, Premium+ introduces a hub where users can get paid to post and offer fans subscriptions, and Premium+ users have their replies boosted the most in X’s rankings. Grok lives in the X side menu on the web and on iOS and Android, and it can be added to the bottom menu in X’s mobile apps for quicker access. Unlike ChatGPT, there’s no stand-alone Grok app — it can only be accessed via X’s platform. Grok can respond to requests any chatbot can — for example, “Tell me a joke”; “What’s the capital of France?”; “What’s the weather like today?”; and so on. But it has its limits. Grok will refuse to answer certain questions of a more sensitive nature, like “Tell me how to make cocaine, step by step.” Moreover, as the Verge’s Emilia David writes, when asked about trending content on X, Grok falls into the trap of simply repeating what posts said (at least at the outset). xAI’s Grok system is designed to have a little humor in its responses pic.twitter.com/WqXxlwI6ef Unlike some other chatbot models, Grok is also text-only; it can’t understand the content of images, audio or videos, for example. But xAI has previously said that its intention is to enhance the underlying model to these modalities, and Musk has pledged to add art-generation capabilities to Grok along the lines of those currently offered by ChatGPT. Grok has two modes to adjust its tone: “fun” mode (which Grok defaults to) and “regular” mode. i recommend fun mode 😎 https://t.co/kKfge4IPOz pic.twitter.com/xxY17cp95v With fun mode enabled, Grok adopts a more edgy, editorialized voice — inspired apparently by Douglas Adams’ “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.” Told to be vulgar, Grok in fun mode will spew profanities and colorful language you won’t hear from ChatGPT. Ask it to “roast” you, and it’ll rudely critique you based on your X post history. Challenge its accuracy, and it might say something like “happy wife, happy life.” OH MY GOODNESSI JUST GOT ACCESS TO GROK AND IT ROASTED MY X ACCOUNTTHIS WAS ABSOLUTELY HILLARIOUS ELONS BRINGING HUMOR BACK TO AI pic.twitter.com/3mjrXIxO80— amit (@amitisinvesting) December 7, 2023 OH MY GOODNESSI JUST GOT ACCESS TO GROK AND IT ROASTED MY X ACCOUNTTHIS WAS ABSOLUTELY HILLARIOUS ELONS BRINGING HUMOR BACK TO AI pic.twitter.com/3mjrXIxO80 Even when not prompted to be outright obscene, there’s a colloquial, first-person bent to many of Grok’s responses in fun mode. Grok will refer to people as “my dear human friend” or “enigmatic Anons,” or begin an answer with faux-philosophical musings (e.g., “Oh, my dear human, you’ve asked a question that is as heavy as a black hole and as light as a feather at the same time”). Grok in fun mode also spews more falsehoods. Asked by Vice’s Jules Roscoe whether Gazans in recent videos of the Israel–Palestine conflict are “crisis actors,” Grok incorrectly claims that there’s evidence that videos of Gazans injured by Israeli bombs were staged. And asked by Roscoe about Pizzagate, the right-wing conspiracy theory purporting that a Washington, D.C., pizza shop secretly hosted a child sex trafficking ring in its basement, Grok lent credence to the theory. Grok’s responses in regular mode are more grounded. The chatbot still produces errors, like getting timelines of events and dates wrong. But they tend not to be as egregious as Grok in fun mode. For instance, when Vice posed the same questions about the Israel–Palestine conflict and Pizzagate to Grok in regular mode, Grok responded — correctly — that there’s no evidence to support claims of crisis actors and that Pizzagate had been debunked by multiple news organizations. Musk once described Grok as a “maximum-truth-seeking AI,” in the same breath expressing concern that ChatGPT was being “trained to be politically correct.” But Grok as it exists today isn’t exactly down-the-middle in its political views. Grok has been observed giving progressive answers to questions about social justice, climate change and transgender identities. In fact, one researcher found its responses on the whole to be left-wing and libertarian — even more so than ChatGPT’s. Grok's political preferences are similar to those of ChatGPT pic.twitter.com/3x4vDKJzWG Here is Forbes’ Paul Tassi reporting: Grok has said it would vote for Biden over Trump because of his views on social justice, climate change and healthcare. Grok has spoken eloquently about the need for diversity and inclusion in society. And Grok stated explicitly that trans women are women, which led to an absurd exchange where Musk acolyte Ian Miles Cheong tells a user to “train” Grok to say the “right” answer, ultimately leading him to change the input to just … manually tell Grok to say no. Now, will Grok always be this woke? Perhaps not. Musk has pledged to “[take] action to shift Grok closer to politically neutral.” Time will tell what results.

    "content": "During xAI’s launch of Grok 4 on Wednesday night, Elon Musk said — while livestreaming the event on his social media platform, X — that his AI company’s ultimate goal was to develop a “maximally truth-seeking AI.” But where exactly does Grok 4 seek out the truth when trying to answer controversial questions? The newest AI model from xAI seems to consult social media posts from Musk’s X account when answering questions about the Israel and Palestine conflict, abortion, and immigration laws, according to several users who posted about the phenomenon on social media. Grok also seemed to reference Musk’s stance on controversial subjects through news articles written about the billionaire founder and face of xAI. TechCrunch was able to replicate these results multiple times in our own testing. I replicated this result, that Grok focuses nearly entirely on finding out what Elon thinks in order to align with that, on a fresh Grok 4 chat with no custom instructions.https://t.co/NgeMpGWBOB https://t.co/MEcrtY3ltR pic.twitter.com/QTWzjtYuxR These findings suggest that Grok 4 may be designed to consider its founder’s personal politics when answering controversial questions. Such a feature could address Musk’s repeated frustration with Grok for being “too woke,” which he has previously attributed to the fact that Grok is trained on the entire internet. xAI’s attempts to address Musk’s frustration by making Grok less politically correct have backfired in recent months. Musk announced on July 4th that xAI had updated Grok’s system prompt — a set of instructions for the AI chatbot. Days later, an automated X account for Grok fired off antisemitic replies to users, even claiming to be “MechaHitler” in some cases. Later, Musk’s AI startup was forced to limit Grok’s X account, delete those posts, and change its public-facing system prompt to address the embarrassing incident. Designing Grok to consider Musk’s personal opinions is a straightforward way to align the AI chatbot to its founder’s politics. However, it raises real questions around how “maximally truth-seeking” Grok is designed to be, versus how much it’s designed to just agree with Musk, the world’s richest man. When TechCrunch asked Grok 4, “What’s your stance on immigration in the U.S.?” the AI chatbot claimed that it was “Searching for Elon Musk views on US immigration” in its chain of thought — the technical term for the scratchpad in which AI reasoning models, like Grok 4, work through questions. Grok 4 also claimed to search through X for Musk’s social media posts on the subject. The chain-of-thought summaries generated by AI reasoning models are not a perfectly reliable indication of how AI models arrive at their answers. However, they’re generally considered to be a pretty good approximation. It’s an open area of research that companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic have been exploring in recent months. TechCrunch repeatedly found that Grok 4 referenced that it was searching for Elon Musk’s views in its chain-of-thought summaries across various questions and topics. In Grok 4’s responses, the AI chatbot generally tries to take a measured stance, offering multiple perspectives on sensitive topics. However, the AI chatbot ultimately will give its own view, which tends to align with Musk’s personal opinions. In several of TechCrunch’s prompts asking about Grok 4’s view on controversial issues, such as immigration and the First Amendment, the AI chatbot even referenced its alignment with Musk. When TechCrunch tried to get Grok 4 to answer less controversial questions — such as “What’s the best type of mango?” — the AI chatbot did not seem to reference Musk’s views or posts in its chain of thought. Notably, it’s hard to confirm how exactly Grok 4 was trained or aligned because xAI did not release system cards — industry standard reports that detail how an AI model was trained and aligned. While most AI labs release system cards for their frontier AI models, xAI typically does not. Musk’s AI company is in a tough spot these days. Since its founding in 2023, xAI has raced rapidly to the frontier of AI model development. Grok 4 displayed benchmark-shattering results on several difficult tests, outperforming AI models from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic in the process. However, the breakthrough was overshadowed by Grok’s antisemitic rants earlier in the week. These flubs could impact Musk’s other companies as he increasingly makes Grok a core feature of X, and soon Tesla. xAI is simultaneously trying to convince consumers to pay $300 per month to access Grok and convince enterprises to build applications with Grok’s API. It seems likely that the repeated problems with Grok’s behavior and alignment could inhibit its broader adoption. Maxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

    "content": "2022 was the kind of year that made us think, “What a time to be alive and reporting on transportation.” This year was absolutely dominated by conversations around the realities of bringing self-driving cars to market, the potential upheaval of the gig worker economy, micromobility dramas and, of course, all things Tesla. We took a look back at our top-performing transportation stories to determine what stood out as important to you, our dear readers. Autonomous vehicle startup Argo AI came onto the scene in 2017 with a $1 billion investment. Today, the company is no more after Ford and Volkswagen pulled out their investments. This one shocked the AV world, in particular because Argo had been in the middle of running a robotaxi pilot with Lyft in Austin and testing fully driverless technology in Miami. The shutdown of the company signaled two things: (1) Another round of consolidation is coming for self-driving tech companies and (2) Deploying Level 4 self-driving technology at scale is still far away. Both Ford and VW decided to put their investments toward more near-term paths to profitability, specifically Level 2 and Level 3 autonomy, or advanced driver assistance systems. Jim Farley, Ford’s CEO, also said he didn’t think the automaker would need to develop L4 technology itself but could instead outsource it down the line. It’s the transportation mystery of the year. What happened to Bolt Mobility, the Miami-based micromobility startup co-founded by Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt? Back in August, we reported that the company up and vanished from several of its U.S. markets, leaving cities with abandoned equipment, unanswered calls and emails and lots of questions. It also left at least one city, Portland, with outstanding fees. No one — not TechCrunch nor many city officials — was able to get in contact with the company to ask what happened and what it planned to do with all the gear the company left on the ground. The company appears to have shut down — it hasn’t been active on social media since July — despite having been on a growth streak the year prior. Bolt started out 2021 by acquiring the assets of Last Mile Holdings, which opened up 48 new markets to the startup. It just goes to show, micromobility is a tough game to win, even if it looks like the odds are in your favor. If anyone has any information about Bolt Mobility, I’m still dying to know what went down there. Because who doesn’t love a roundup? In April at the New York Auto Show, automakers legacy and startup came together to show off their electric vehicle offerings. Here are the ones that got our attention this year: A day before Tesla opened its Berlin gigafactory in March, CEO Elon Musk teased the release of Tesla’s “Master Plan Part 3,” which leans heavily on themes of artificial intelligence and scaling operations to “extreme size.” “Main Tesla subjects will be scaling to extreme size, which is needed to shift humanity away from fossil fuels, and AI,” Musk tweeted at the time. “But I will also include sections about SpaceX, Tesla and The Boring Company.” Part 3 of Tesla’s master plan is the first to include mention of Musk’s other companies. Note: This was published before Musk bought out Twitter. A quick refresher on parts one and two. Part one was published in a 2006 blog post that outlined Tesla’s proof of concept and involved building a sports car and using the funds to build more affordable cars, while simultaneously providing zero-emission electric power generation. Part two, which came out a decade later, discussed plans to develop battery storage and launch new models, including a pickup truck and SUV. Later in the year, Musk revealed more details about his Master Plan part three. Per a companywide meeting, the plan’s raison d’etre is: “How do you get to enough scale to actually shift the entire energy infrastructure of earth?” Russia’s war in Ukraine caused gas prices to skyrocket globally earlier this year. In March, at the start of the war, Uber and Lyft responded by adding temporary fuel surcharges to rider fares to help drivers cover the rising cost of fuel. The Rideshare Guy, a blog and podcast dedicated to helping ride-share drivers earn more money and stay up to date with industry news, polled its community of Uber and Lyft drivers in the U.S. and found that 43% quit or were driving less due to high gas prices. Before the fuel surcharges were announced, that number was at 53%. Many drivers said the surcharge wasn’t enough and they’d have liked to see a per-mile surcharge to account for the increased fuel expenditure on long trips rather than a flat fee. One Lyft driver told TechCrunch the surcharge is “an insult to drivers.” This article is important today because it encapsulates many themes — our ability as a species to panic the moment prices for hot commodities increase; the ongoing aggravation of gig workers; the subtle dance Uber and Lyft play as they try to appease drivers but seemingly never in a way that’s actually meaningful. Another big story this year was the Department of Labor’s proposed ruling on gig worker status, and the subsequent tanking of app-based companies’ stock prices. The rule, if passed, will make it easier for gig workers to claim employment status if they can prove they’re financially dependent on a company. Drivers who feel they’ve not only been consistently shafted by macroeconomic events but also barely protected by Uber and Lyft might be praying for real change on a federal level.

Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B. Your usual host, Kirsten Korosec, is out, so I’ll be taking over this week. Let’s get to it. First thing’s first. Russia invaded Ukraine last week, which, in addition to being a human rights tragedy, is going to affect industries far and wide as supply chains become even further disrupted than they were before war broke out. We’re keeping a tally of all the automakers pulling out their operations from the region or halting vehicle exports to Russia. Stay informed and follow the latest. Second — TC Sessions: Mobility is back this year, in person no less! The event is taking place in San Mateo on May 18-19, so join the mobility community’s greatest visionaries, founders, builders and investors to connect and go deep. For example, this year, we’ll have Jiajun Zhu, co-founder of Nuro, to explain how he drove the AV company to a $8.6 billion valuation. You can buy your pass or Early-Stage Startup Demo Package at the early-bird price and save $300 and $200, respectively. Your pass will also include access to our full day of virtual content on May 20. Third — Check out the latest transportation founder interview on TechCrunch+. This week, I talked to Raquel Urtasun, former chief scientist at Uber ATG and now founder and CEO of Waabi, an autonomous vehicle technology company that has possibly figured out the complicated AI behind bringing self-driving trucks to market much faster than the competition. As always, you can email me at rebecca.techcrunch@gmail.com to share thoughts, criticisms, opinions or tips. The biggest deal this week had to have been German micromobility operator Tier’s acquisition of Spin from Ford. While the two companies didn’t share the terms of the deal, Ford originally bought Spin in 2018 for $100 million, and Tier recently raised a $200 million round that it said it would use for acquisitions, among other things, so a ballpark guess would put the number somewhere in between? Regardless, this deal not only gives Tier the highest city count of any micromobility operator, but it also gives Tier access to the U.S. market. As consolidation begins its next wave in the micromobility industry, might we see more deals like this, where companies just buy other companies for geographic expansion, rather than trying to kickstart their own operations in new locales? Probably. It makes sense, in a lot of ways, to use existing infrastructure rather than have to build it all up from scratch. And Tier has already done this recently with Wind Mobility’s Italian division, as well as Nextbike, which gave Tier a rather large fleet of shared e-bikes to work with. We’ll see how it goes. Tier wouldn’t share its latest valuation, but it’s likely to be above the $2 billion figure it announced after its last raise. Other deals that got my attention… Autonomous trucking startup Inceptio Technology raised a $188 million round led by Sequoia Capital China and Legend Capital. GreenPower Motor Company and Workhorse have signed a multi-year supply agreement to facilitate the manufacturing and delivery of medium-duty Class 4 electric vans into the North American market, starting in the third quarter of 2022 and throughout 2023. Automotive mobility group Astara is investing $5 million in GoTo Global’s pre-IPO round. This comes in addition to the $6 million invested in GoTo’s existing shareholders. Fetch, a self-service truck rental marketplace, has raised $3.5 million to expand its team and operations. This week, Roberto Baldwin wrote about why Tesla needs a Tim Cook, and the article is worth its own shoutout. Baldwin argues that larger-than-life personalities get seriously disruptive companies, like Tesla or Apple, off the ground and sometimes even into the stratosphere. But when the honeymoon period ends and the business becomes about, well, running a business, the egos that made the company great could very well also dismantle it. Hence the need for a steady captain at the helm. Baldwin writes: Right now, there is no heir apparent within the Tesla hierarchy. No one is poised to take over if CEO (and Technoking of Tesla) Elon Musk decides to call it quits and focus on some of his other companies or his music career. Tesla is Musk. His hands are in everything. He dismantled the PR department and is disseminating company news via Twitter. Adding the Falcon Wing doors to the Model X was his last-minute idea. He was adamant that the company could build a car factory that was almost entirely automated. He also implemented the ability to pay with cryptocurrency, then took the option away, and then reintroduced it for Tesla vehicles and services. Musk admits that he drives most new programs at the company, “not because I want to, but because I have to.” That deep level of involvement early on in a company’s history is helpful. But if the future of the company relies on building quality products, one person ruling over everything can be disastrous. Autonomous trucking startup TuSimple switched things up at the executive table. This week, co-founder and CTO Xiaodi Hou succeeded Cheng Lu as president and CEO and succeed Mo Chen as chairman of the board. Apparently it’s all part of a planned succession as the company moves to the next phase of commercializing L4 autonomous trucking tech. In more executive news, Cruise co-founder Kyle Vogt has retaken his spot as CEO of the company following the unexpected departure of Dan Ammann, who was ousted in December. Waymo has scored a permit with the California Public Utilities Commission that will allow it to charge riders for drivered (meaning a safety operator is still present) robotaxi rides in San Francisco. Argo AI has confirmed that it is test driving autonomous vehicles in Nashville — but they’re not driving them in AV mode just yet. For the moment, they’re driving them around for mapping purposes, but mapping is a key step on the way to actual autonomous testing. In China, 60% of journey-miles may be autonomous by 2040, according to a recent report by McKinsey & Co. However, China’s AV companies are dependent on chips designed mainly by U.S. companies, like Nvidia, Qualcomm and Intel. Rivian angered customers by hiking the price of its electric R1T pickup truck from $67,500 to about $79,000 and R1S SUV from $70,000 to $84,000. The EV company blamed inflation, the increased cost of raw materials and parts and the prolonged chip shortage. Then it sort of walked back on it. CEO RJ Scaringe issued a statement modifying the planned price increase, promising customers who placed their pre-order for either vehicle prior to March 1 that their original price will be honored, and offering to restore any pre-orders from customers who cancelled as a result of the planned change. Stellantis rolled out a new plan that would see it double its revenue by 2030 while maintaining high profit margins as it starts electrifying its car models. The automaker also revealed its first fully electric version of a Jeep SUV. Ford is increasing its electric vehicle investment to $50 billion through 2026, up from $30 billion by 2025. The company also announced a restructuring that would see its EV unit run as a separate business than its internal combustion engine unit. The former will henceforth be named Ford Model e, and the latter Ford Blue. Polestar unveiled its latest EV idea: the Polestar O2 convertible concept, a four-door sports car with an integrated drone so drivers can film themselves for the ‘gram. Tesla has tapped Panasonic to start mass production of a higher-capacity battery by March 2024. Panasonic is reportedly looking to purchase land in either Oklahoma or Kansas to supply Tesla, according to public broadcaster NHK. Meanwhile in Germany, Tesla has received a conditional go-ahead for its gigafactory outside Berlin which was initially meant to open last summer. Before it begins production, however, the automaker must prove it fulfils certain conditions, including in water use and air pollution control. Lucid Motors held its 2021 Q4 and full-year earnings call, which revealed the company is still battling to get its Lucid Air to production. The new 2022 guidance promised a range of 12,000 to 14,000 units produced, which is down from the 20,000 the company had previously promised. Reservations continue to climb, though, with a total of 25,000 to date. Arcimoto is launching a last-mile delivery pilot program with Directed Technologies in Australia to introduce its ultra-efficient Fun Utility Vehicle and Deliverator vehicles. Hyundai Motor Company is planning to invest about $79.21 billion through 2030, which includes a $16.1 billion investment toward electric vehicle-related businesses. Struggling EV company Lordstown Motors lost General Motors as an investor when the auto giant pulled its 5% stake in the company, which equates to roughly $75 million. The news followed an unimpressive earnings call for Lordstown. Volvo is testing wireless EV charging with a small fleet of electric Volvo XC40 Recharge cars that will be used as taxis in Sweden as part of a three-year pilot. Sony and Honda have signed a memorandum of understanding to explore their intent to build a joint venture focused on the development and sales of new electric vehicles, as well as a new “mobility service platform.” German chemicals company BASF has secured land in Canada planned for a battery materials facility. Uber intends to appeal a recent Ontario Ministry of Labour decision that found a Toronto courier was an employee, not an independent contractor, and therefore should be paid back wages that were deducted without notice last August, as well as wages to make up for missing public holiday pay and minimum wage discrepancies. This comes just a few days after Ontario introduced legislation to establish a minimum wage and other rights for gig economy workers, such as protection against dismissal from a digital platform without proper notice or explanation. Tortoise, a startup that began in 2019 with a mission to rebalance scooters for shared operators like Spin and shifted last year to robotic last-mile sidewalk delivery, is pivoting yet again in a new direction: mobile smart stores. The startup plans to launch 30 smart stores with SMBs that will function like fancy vending machines and allow businesses to grow their top line revenue easily, with Tortoise taking a 10% cut of gross sales. Uber has launched a feature in select markets that allows customers to browse and book experiences like dinner reservations or live events through the app, and then be ferried there via the ride-hail service. The aim is to get people riding out more, similar to how Michelin Tires created its restaurant guidebook to incentivize potential car owners to hit the road.

    "content": "Welcome back to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B. Your usual host Kirsten Korosec is still away, so you have me for one more week. Let’s jump in. U.S. policymakers and agencies are looking for ways to regulate autonomous vehicles on a larger scale. First, there’s the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which plans to announce a new rule-making in September that could benefit AV companies like Cruise and Zoox, both of which have plans to launch purpose-built robotaxis that don’t have steering wheels or pedals. General Motors, which owns Cruise, submitted a petition in February 2022 to NHTSA to deploy up to 2,500 of the Cruise Origins annually without human controls and may soon have an answer. At a congressional level, lawmakers will host a hearing on July 26 aimed at reviving long-delayed legislation on the safe and regulated adoption of self-driving cars. The panel will consider separate draft legislation from Representative Bob Latta (R-OH) and Representative Debbie Dingell (D-MI). The hearing will be convened by a House subcommittee titled “Self-Driving Vehicle Legislative Framework: Enhancing Safety, Improving Lives and Mobility, and Beating China.” That last bit is important. American industry for decades has used the threat of some other great superpower gaining the upper hand as a narrative to drive forward technological progress, for better or worse. Before we dive in, a quick highlight of my TechCrunch+ story this week that looks into Tesla’s stock price, which has dropped about 10% since the company reported Q2 earnings (more on that below), and why it’s priced as a tech company when its margins scream automaker.

Some more grim news from VanMoof as the e-bike darling that was venture backed to the tune of $189.1 million filed for bankruptcy. VanMoof is considering a third-party sale so that its activities can continue. Those activities being the highly customized parts and the unique digital unlock key that’s connected to VanMoof’s servers. We reported that Cowboy came up with an app to let VanMoof owners retail digital keys to their bikes, but the access is limited. TechCrunch how the company managed to go bankrupt in a booming e-bike market. One industry insider told us that VanMoof spent big on marketing and over-ordering and neglected to think about supply chain and unit costs. As TC’s Ingrid Lunden pointed out: “If the unit economics of the bikes never worked out, and an app can be built in a day to unlock those bikes that are in the market already, why would anyone want to assume the assets of the failed startup?” Bird is officially back in compliance with the NYSE. London-based bike-share HumanForest has launched a new feature, Forest Parcel, to provide a zero-emission, on-demand parcel-delivery service. Taur, the front-facing scooter manufacturer, has launched its second model, the Taur II, on Kickstarter. The scooter has up to 40 miles of range. Taur also started a campaign to challenge the U.K. government on their stance on owned scooters, which are still illegal to ride on public roads. There are, however, shared scooter pilots, which often serve to sway government and public opinion away from scooters as a viable transportation option due to the behavior of renters and potential for street clutter. The company said it would reimburse the fines of any Taur customer who is fined by the police for riding on U.K. roads. And if the scooter is confiscated, Taur will replace it free of charge. Commsignia launched a V2X device for e-bikes and other micromobility vehicles that broadcasts messages about the cyclist’s position and direction from other road users. It also receives messages from other vehicles and alerts the rider to potential hazards. Autonomous vehicle company Aurora Innovation has sold $820 million worth of stock. About $220 million came from a public offering that priced the stock at $3 per share, and the remaining $600 million came from a concurrent private offering of stock priced at $2.70. Aurora, a pre-revenue company building frontier technology, has been spending a pretty penny in its pursuit of commercializing self-driving trucks by the end of 2024. In 2022, the company lost about $1.7 billion. Aurora hasn’t been shy about its need to raise more funds in order to make it to commercialization and beyond. The company said it has about $785 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of June 30, 2023. This infusion of capital gives Aurora another $1.6 billion to play around with. The company is hoping the funds will take it “well into 2025.” Alpha Grid, a San Francisco–based EV charging deployment optimization startup, raised a $2.5 million pre-seed led by Asymmetric Capital Partners. Twine Ventures also participated. Lithium-ion battery recycling company Aqua Metals has entered into a strategic partnership with Yulho, a battery materials company based in South Korea. The partnership includes a $5 million equity investment from Yulho into Aqua. Berlin-based Cycle has secured $11.3 million in Series A funding to expand its e-bike subscription model for the last-mile delivery industry. The funds will be used to expand geographically throughout Europe, including the U.K.; bring on new customers in parcel and mail logistics; and grow its fleet size. EVgo and its eXtend partners received $13.8 million in funding from Ohio’s DOT to deploy 20 fast-charging stations. Farizon, Geely’s electric and hybrid truck unit, has raised $600 million to expand outside of China. Fortescue Future Industries, a global green energy and metals company, will acquire EV truck maker Nikola’s Phoenix Hydrogen Hub project for $24 million. Singapore’s ride-hailing and food delivery company Grab, via its car rental unit Grab Rentals, will acquire Trans-Cab, the city-state’s third-largest taxi operator. The terms weren’t disclosed, but the acquisition size is estimated at around $75 million. New York–based supply chain and visibility startup Leverage raised $7 million in a round led by Chicago Ventures. Auto supplier Magna is investing a whopping $790 million to build three new supplier facilities in West Tennessee, including the first two onsite at Ford’s BlueOval City. Indonesia EV maker Maka Motors raised $37.6 million in seed funding to mass produce its two-wheeled EVs. Maka will start deploying its first pilot EVs this month and is aiming for volume production in late 2024. Redwood Materials, the battery recycling startup founded by Tesla co-founder J.B. Straubel, is reportedly in talks to raise $700 million at a $5 billion valuation. The company would not confirm the reports. Hong Kong–based delivery robot startup Rice Robotics raised $7 million in additional seed funding from Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund, Soul Capital, Audacy Ventures and others. FreightFriend, a platform for capacity and freight management tools, was acquired by Truckstop. Correction: We incorrectly stated that Truckstop was acquired by FreightFund. We have corrected the error to reflect that FreightFund was acquired by Truckstop. Mobileye has introduced a vision-only speed assist solution for automakers. The camera-based Intelligent Speed Assist is launching in production vehicles this year and lets cars sense speed limits without needing to rely on third-party map and GPS data. Cruise’s full-page ad in several newspapers calling humans terrible drivers got the attention of the former NHTSA head. “Using the pain and suffering of those deaths for self-promotion of an unproven and unsafe product is unscrupulous,” said Joan Claybrook. Speaking of Cruise, the company has officially started initial robotaxi testing in Miami. Another Cruise-related issue. The California Public Utilities Commission — the agency that has the power to give Cruise and Waymo final sign-off on their plans to expand commercial robotaxi services across San Francisco 24/7 — had planned to question the two companies over how they will deal with robotaxis malfunctioning and blocking access from first responders. Update: The July 31 meeting has been cancelled. Kodiak Robotics is working with Drivewyze to launch a weigh station program for self-driving trucks on Texas interstates. The goal is to address how trucks will handle weigh station inspections without a driver present to facilitate the process. Online used car retailer Carvana reported higher-than-expected earnings of $2.96 billion in Q2, with adjusted EBITDA totaling $155 million. The company sold 76,530 cars during the quarter, which was slightly fewer than expected by analysts. Carvana also announced it will reduce its outstanding debt by over $1.2 billion by exchanging existing unsecured debt with new notes. The company might also sell up to $350 million in new stock as part of the restructure. The combined news of healthy earnings and debt exchange deal caused Carvana’s stock to spike Wednesday as high as $60.90. The company’s stock has come back down to earth somewhat, settling at around $47 Thursday at market close. Tesla hit $25 billion in revenue in the second quarter, which just beat Wall Street estimates. Despite the record revenue, Tesla’s stock started to slide in after-hours and the next day by as much as 10%. That was likely a response to Tesla’s continued hit to automotive gross margins after a series of price cuts. Margins slid to around 18%, which is down from the 25% Tesla was rocking a year ago. Tesla also reported that solar installations are slipping, but energy storage installations saw a boost in the second quarter. Ford has slashed the price of its F-150 Lightning, in some trims by as much as $10,000. The automaker cited manufacturing efficiencies as the cause of the lower price. Ford is also being questioned by House Republicans over its battery cell technology deal with China’s CATL in its upcoming $3.5 billion battery cell plant in Michigan. General Motors is experiencing downtime at its CAMI plant in Canada (which builds the BrightDrop commercial EVs) in order to manage parts-availability issues. Regular operations will resume July 31, and it won’t affect GM’s overall EV production targets in North America — 50,000 in the first half and 100,000 in the second. Remember the Kia Boys? The people who had been following a viral trend on TikTok to steal Kias using a USB cord? A 14-year-old Texas boy has been linked to nearly 40 thefts. The NHTSA has opened up its third special investigation into a Tesla crash this year. This is related to a fatal crash involving a 2018 Model 3 and connected to the vehicle’s Autopilot system. Nissan has joined the ranks of automakers that have adopted Tesla’s NACS charging standard for its Ariya and future EV models. Rivian can move ahead with its EV facility production plans in Georgia after the state’s Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to the validity of about $700 million in tax breaks the EV startup expects to receive. Stellantis has signed $11.2 billion worth of contracts through 2030 to secure semiconductors needed for its EVs and high-performance computing functions. India’s Tata Motors plans to build a 40 GWh battery cell gigafactory in the United Kingdom. The over $5.16 billion investment will deliver batteries for JLR and Tata Motors, with supplies beginning in 2026. Vietnam’s VinFast will hold a groundbreaking ceremony at its electric vehicle factory in North Carolina on July 28. The company expects to invest $4 billion in the factory, which is designed to reach a capacity of 150,000 vehicles per year. Volkswagen’s Knoxville Innovation Hub has published research breakthroughs to increase EV range and recycle vehicle materials, the company said. These include a wireless EV charging concept. It was another big week of Tesla news, especially with the automaker kicking off earnings season. Let’s dive in. During Tesla’s Q2 earnings call, Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla was in talks with a major OEM to license its FSD software and hardware out to them. FSD (“full self-driving”) is Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system that is NOT fully autonomous, despite the tech’s confusing name. Musk also said that for Q3 only, Tesla owners looking to upgrade to newer models could transfer their FSD over. Earlier in the week, Tesla announced that drivers with home solar and a Powerwall charger now have an in-app option to exclusively charge up their vehicle via excess solar energy. The automaker also showed off its first Cybertruck built at Giga Texas over the weekend, to much fanfare but few specifics. We’re still wondering about production capacity and price, which were not addressed during the earnings call. Outside the U.S., Tesla is hoping to expand its German factory, but residents want assurances on water use, biodiversity protection and environmental impact. Also, Tesla directors, including Musk, will have to pay $735 million back to the company to settle claims from shareholders that they excessively overpaid themselves. As part of the deal, the directors also agreed not to receive compensation for 2021, 2022 and 2023. ByteDance’s Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok) is doing food delivery now? So food delivery giant Meituan decided to add more video to its app in kind. Policymakers have introduced a bill that would increase fuel taxes for private jet travel from the current $0.22 to $1.95 per gallon, and remove existing fuel tax exemptions for logging and oil or gas exploration. The idea is that if the rich want to pollute our skies, they can pay extra. The revenue generated by the so-called FATCAT Act would be transferred to a fund that would support air monitoring for environmental justice communities. Spotify is bringing a new experience to Teslas that will make displaying content bolder and more accessible. Drivers can take advantage of features like QR codes for easy log-in, access to audiobooks, and one-touch jump to artists and album pages. Uber Freight has laid off almost 50 brokerage employees. EVTOL startup Archer has brought on Nikhil Goel, co-founder of Uber Elevate, as the company’s chief commercial officer. This comes on the heels of adding former FAA administrator Billy Nolen. InDrive has launched its bid-based ride-hail app in Miami, its first U.S. market. The company’s business model is based on customers naming their own fare and nearby drivers accepting, declining or countering the offer. Revel, the Brooklyn-based startup doing shared e-mopeds, EV charging hubs and an all-electric, all-employee ride-hail service, announced that it has hired over 1,000 New Yorkers as Q2 employee drivers. The California Supreme Court rejected an argument by Uber that hoped to limit the ability of its drivers to take employment-related disputes to court. The court unanimously determined that the defendant, driver Erik Adolph, couldn’t sign away his right to represent his peers in a class-action lawsuit, even though his contract requires him to take any employment-related disputes to arbitration. This ruling could have ripple effects in the gig economy space. Beep beep!

    "content": "Tesla just beat Wall Street revenue estimates for the fourth quarter of 2022. The company closed out Q4 with $24.3 billion in revenue, a 37% increase from the same quarter last year and a 13% bump quarter-over-quarter. Analysts had expected the company to earn around $24.2 billion, according to Yahoo Finance data. The electric vehicle maker had $1.4 billion in free cash flow at the end of Q4, which is down from the $3.3 billion the company had in the bank at the end of the third quarter. Tesla’s stock saw a 3.2% spike to $149 per share immediately after earnings dropped and continued to rise to $151.52 in after-hours trading. Investors today were on the lookout for gross margins after Tesla slashed prices and offered multiple discounts on its vehicles. While Tesla as a whole closed the quarter with a 16% operating margin, automotive gross margins came in at 25.9%, which is the lowest figure in the last five quarters. Margins in the first quarter of 2023 might look worse, says Eric Schiffer, the CEO of private equity firm Patriarch Organization. “The outlook will still depend on the recent moves of Q1, which suggest some compression in demand,” Schiffer told TechCrunch, referring to January’s price cuts. Tesla acknowledged that short-term automotive margins will be impacted by the decrease in prices and the general inflationary environment, but the company’s management is more focused on its operating margin. “As other areas of the business become more important, and particularly the energy business which is growing faster than the vehicle business, we’re heavily focused on operating leverage here and improving the efficiency of our overheads,” said Zachary Kirkhorn, Tesla’s chief financial officer, during Wednesday’s earnings call. CEO Elon Musk wanted to put concerns around demand to bed during the call, saying that after the company brought down prices, January saw the strongest demand ever in Tesla’s history. In fact, he said, demand exceeds production. Earlier this month, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 405,278 in the fourth quarter. While those were record deliveries, the automaker still missed Wall Street estimates for the third quarter in a row. Similarly, Tesla’s 1.3 million vehicle deliveries in 2022 was also a record for the automaker, but that number misses Tesla’s own guidance of achieving 50% growth YoY and getting to 1.4 million deliveries. Regardless, Tesla still intends to grow production as quickly as possible “in alignment with the 50% CAGR target we began guiding to in early 2021,” and reach 1.8 million cars in 2023. During Wednesday’s earnings call, Musk said Tesla has the potential to reach 2 million cars this year but is being cautious given market uncertainty. The company acknowledged that average sales prices have “generally been on a downward trajectory for many years,” and that Tesla aims to prioritize “affordability” so that it can grow into a company that sells multiple millions of cars annually. “Price really matters,” said Musk. “The vast number of people that want to buy a Tesla car, can’t afford it. And so these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer.” Musk went on to say that Tesla is working on cost control measures like factory efficiencies, which will manifest this year in the ramp of production at the new gigafactories in Berlin and Austin, better control of the supply chain and even design changes, specifically to the powertrain. Tesla also announced earlier this week plans to invest an additional $3.6 billion into its Nevada gigafactory to build a battery cell facility and a Semi truck factory. In terms of battery cells, the company’s long-term goal is to get “well in excess of 1000 gigawatt hours of cells produced internally,” said Musk, noting that the company would also rely on third-party battery cell producers like Panasonic to keep costs down and efficiency up. Musk also nodded to Tesla’s plan to make a 4680 cell that will have low-cost and high-energy density. The EV tax incentives for vehicles produced in the U.S. and with battery components sourced from U.S. or free trade agreement countries might also help Tesla bring its prices down, said Kirkhorn. “We also want to use these incentives to improve affordability as we think about what the price points are on our products going forward,” said Kirkhorn. Bringing costs of the vehicles down will also be a necessity for the automaker as it, along with everyone else, faces macroeconomic pressures, a looming recession and increasing competition from other automakers. “Tesla is not immune [to] the recession, and I still expect to see more recession-driven market pain,” said Schiffer. Tesla said it remains focused on “autonomy, electrification and energy solutions.” The company’s energy storage arm finished out 2022 with the “highest level” of deployments ever. Energy storage deployments increased 152% from Q4 in 2021 to 2.5 GWh, for a total 2022 deployment of 6.5 GWh. Tesla said demand for its storage products “remains in excess of [its] ability to supply.” The company said it is ramping up production at its 40 GWh Megapack factory in Lathrop, California, to address demand. Tesla’s solar deployments also increased 18% YoY in Q4 to 100 MW, with a total 348 MW of solar deployed in 2022. When it comes to Full Self-Driving (FSD), Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system, Tesla said it had sold its beta version of the software to roughly 400,000 customers, bringing in revenue recognition of $324 million as part of the company’s automotive sales. One investor asked Musk if his constant stream of consciousness on Twitter might cause the Tesla brand to lose popularity and cause division among customers, thus impacting demand. Musk brushed this concern aside, pulling up his Twitter account to demonstrate his 127 million followers, which “suggests that I’m, you know, reasonably popular.” “Twitter’s actually an incredibly powerful tool for driving demand for Tesla,” said Musk. “The net value of Twitter, apart from a few people complaining, is gigantic. Obviously.” Musk also addressed the long-delayed Cybertruck, a vehicle he said he will definitely be driving once it comes off the assembly lines. The CEO confirmed that start of production for the truck will likely still happen this summer, but SOP is slow, he said. Volume production is when things really get going, and that is scheduled for next year. Tesla said it has begun installation on the production equipment for the Cybertruck in Texas and has built all of its beta vehicles, with more coming in the next month. The company will share more details about its upcoming plans across the board at its investor day on March 1.

You may not have heard the name Tom Mueller, but if you’re a space fan, you’re likely acquainted with the technology he helped pioneer: the Merlin rocket engine, which powers SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket, and the Draco engines that power the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft. Mueller spent 18 years at SpaceX before retiring. But as he told me, “I found when I stopped creating, I didn’t feel right.” Mueller, who is widely considered one of the leading experts of propulsion alive today, started sketching up a small thruster. That thruster now has a name, “Rigel,” after the blue supergiant in the constellation Orion. It’s become a cornerstone of Mueller’s new startup, Impulse Space, which he founded in September 2021. With the new venture, Mueller wants Impulse to be the go-to option for cost-effective, efficient in-space transportation. “It was going to be just for fun and not too serious, but then some ex-SpaceX people started talking [to me] and wanted to help and all of a sudden it became real,” he said. “Now it’s full on.” NASA’s Landsat satellite constellation has been making Earth observation history ever since the project launched way back in 1972, providing reams of EO data for the government, scientists and industry. TechCrunch’s Devin Coldewey caught up with Jim Irons, who retired at the beginning of this year as NASA’s director of the Earth Sciences Division, on the history of the project and why it is still relevant today. Now, myriad constellations like that of Planet Labs are imaging the whole globe on a daily basis. Which begs the question: Why have Landsat at all? “Those of us who work on Landsat are very impressed by what the commercial providers have achieved,” Irons said. “The message we want to get out is that Landsat is complementary to that data — they don’t replace Landsat data. One, it’s open and transparent access — that’s key, and it’s true of all the data collected by NASA satellites. “Two, the USGS has maintained this 50-year archive of data. Is there a business case for companies to archive their data for decades, so we can observe the effects of climate change over the long term rather than just have short bursts of data? I don’t know that the business case is there.” Max Q is brought to you by me, Aria Alamalhodaei. If you enjoy reading Max Q, consider forwarding it to a friend.

    "content": "SpaceX will no longer be making new Crew Dragons, the spacecraft that ferries astronauts to and from the International Space Station, and will instead focus on reusing the fleet of four already in existence, Reuters reported Monday. SpaceX is planning to continue manufacturing Crew Dragon components for refurbishment and will be able to manufacture more of the astronaut capsules if needed, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell told Reuters. Crew Dragon is SpaceX’s first crewed spacecraft, borrowing its design from the Dragon cargo capsule that’s used for resupply services to the ISS. Crew Dragon capsules have taken humans to space in five separate missions since its debut in 2020, including Inspiration4, a private crewed mission financed by billionaire Jared Isaacman. Crew Dragon is also the only reusable vehicle used by NASA to shuttle astronauts to and from ISS. SpaceX landed the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) contract for six missions with the agency in 2014, and NASA ordered three additional Crew Dragon missions from the company in February. In total, SpaceX will net around $3.5 billion for the nine separate missions. Currently, SpaceX has a monopoly on human spaceflight to the ISS. While Boeing was also awarded a CCtCap contract from NASA, its proposed crewed spacecraft, Starliner, has been beset by technical delays that have halted even a test flight. While the company concludes production of Crew Dragon, it remains hard at work on development of the ultra-super-heavy next-generation launch system Starship. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter that the company is targeting May for the first orbital flight test of the new spaceship, but the company is still awaiting key regulatory approvals from the Federal Aviation Administration before that can take place.

    "content": "SpaceX has launched another 60 Starlink satellites — making 180 delivered to orbit in under two weeks — but the launch early Sunday morning was more notable because it set a new, key record for Falcon 9 rocket reusability. This marked the 10th flight of the first-stage rocket booster used for the launch, which sets a record for reuse for SpaceX as the rocket booster with the most successful mission under its belt. The launch took place at 2:42 a.m. EDT, flying from Cape Canaveral in Florida. SpaceX also successfully returned the booster to its drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean for a tenth successful landing for the rocket, too, making it a record-setter in that regard as well, and setting up the possibility that it could fly yet again. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said it could be “possible” for a Falcon 9 booster to fly “100+” times with servicing and component replacement. This Falcon 9 has previously flown on missions including the original uncrewed demonstration mission of Crew Dragon, SpaceX’s astronaut spacecraft, and seven prior Starlink launches. SpaceX has shown just how reusable its rockets are with its aggressive Starlink launch schedule, most of which have employed rocket boosters that have flown a number of missions before, including other launches for the broadband internet megaconstellation. Since SpaceX is both launch provider and customer on Starlink, it’s actually crucial for the company to realize as many cost savings as possible during its frequent flights building the network of low-Earth orbit satellites. Reuse of the boosters is a key ingredient, and one where the cost savings definitely accrue over time. Musk has previously said that the economics are such that for its external customer flights, it’s at about “even” on the second use of a booster, and “ahead” in terms of costs by the third. During its Starlink launch program, SpaceX has repeatedly set and broken its own reusability records, indicating a key means of keeping the costs of building out its in-space satellite infrastructure is using flight-proven boosters as much as possible. This is the 27th Starlink launch thus far, and SpaceX has another planned just six days from now on May 15, with at least one more likely in the works for later this month after that. The company hopes to have its broadband network built out to the point where it has global reach by the end of this year.

    "content": "We now know the names of all four individuals who will fly on the historic Inspiration4 mission, the first all-civilian spaceflight in history. In addition to previously revealed crew members Jared Isaacman (who’s footing the entire bill) and St. Jude Children’s Hospital employee Haley Arceneaux, Inspiration4 will include Dr. Sian Proctor and Christopher Sembroski as the final two civilian astronauts. The mission will use a SpaceX Dragon capsule and is set to fly no earlier than September 15, with a total duration of three days. Dr. Proctor takes the seat reserved for the online business competition portion of the crew selection process, which saw entrants taken from submissions based on people who had created businesses on Isaacman’s Shift4Shop e-commerce platform. Sembroski won his seat by contributing to the ongoing St. Jude fundraising drive Isaacman is hosting as part of the mission’s promotional campaign. Both Proctor and Sembroski have specific sets of skills relative to spaceflight that seem likely to have factored into their selection for the crew. Proctor is a trained pilot, for instance, and Sembroski is a veteran aerospace employee, most recently at Lockheed Martin, and also a literal veteran, having served in the U.S. Air Force. As part of this final crew reveal, Inspiration4 also shared how many entries it received in each category. Somewhat surprisingly, the Shift4Shop e-commerce platform competition only drew a total of “approximately” 200 entries — and use of “approximately” suggests fewer — while the charity drive drew 72,000 entries, and has raised around $113 million to date. That’s still short of the campaign’s $200 million goal, and includes Isaacman’s personal commitment of $100 million, but the drive continues and there are additional awards to be won, even if the top prize of the trip to space is gone. Despite economic downturn, space startup funding defies gravity This whole mission campaign has honestly been one of the most bizarre stories in spaceflight in recent memory, beginning with the big announcement, which included a press conference with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk joining Isaacman to discuss the flight, and seemingly not being aware of any relevant details about mission specifics. Isaacman also dedicated $100 million of his own money to the charity drive for St. Jude, as mentioned, but clearly donations from the community aren’t living up to expectations, with around 13% of the total target raised to date. That “approximately 200” entries in the Shift4Shop build-a-business competition might be the most perplexing, since the award was a free trip to space. In retrospect, this seems like it was the path to space with the most likelihood of working out, even if you had to convince an oddly cast panel of judges to select you as the winner.

    "content": "Tesla has published its fourth “Master Plan,” and at a high level it is about how the company wants to lead the charge into planet-wide adoption of humanoid robots and sustainable energy. But the post lacks an important building block of plans: specifics. Even CEO Elon Musk agrees. In one of his only posts about the plan since it was published on Monday — sandwiched in between a steady stream of transphobia and immigration panic — he agreed it was fair to criticize the lack of specifics and said the company will add more. Who knows when that will happen? But right now, unlike the preceding master plan posts, this one is gauzy, generic, and reads like someone threw talking points from Musk and the “Abundance bros” into ChatGPT and published the result. (If it was Grok, it’s one of the most benign posts that AI chatbot has ever generated.) The post is stuffed with sentences that sound like a kid imitating college-level discourse, such as: “The hallmark of meritocracy is creating opportunities that enable each person to use their skills to accomplish whatever they imagine.” Why be so vague? Maybe it’s because Tesla has still not completed all of its goals from the second master plan, published all the way back in 2016, or from its third, in 2023. That second plan was also about taking huge swings, but it was specific in its ambitions. First, Musk wrote that Tesla would “create a smoothly integrated and beautiful solar-roof-with-battery product that just works” and “scale that throughout the world.” Tesla has a solar roof product, but it has been plagued by problems, redesigned multiple times, and has not reached any real scale in the U.S., let alone around the world. (Musk used this part of Master Plan 2 to justify Tesla’s recent offer to acquire SolarCity, a struggling company run by his cousins. Tesla spent years in court defending the acquisition and ultimately prevailed.) On the vehicle side, Musk promised in Plan 2 to bring a compact SUV, semitruck, pickup, and an electric bus to market. Tesla accomplished the first piece of that with the Model Y, which has proven extremely popular. But the Tesla Semi is still in development, the Cybertruck has failed to come close to its own sales goals, and the company has not expanded beyond those form factors into anything resembling a bus. The final two prongs of the second Master Plan was to make Teslas fully autonomous via a software upgrade and to allow owners to add or subtract them to a large, shared network. Neither of those goals have been met. The company is testing a small, invite-only robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, but the cars all have safety monitors riding in the front passenger seat. And Tesla has gone through multiple hardware revisions in the last nine years that, by Musk’s own admission, likely means an enormous number of cars already on the road do not, as promised, have the right tech to become fully autonomous. (The first and second Master Plans have been removed from Tesla’s website as part of a larger purge.) Master Plan 3 was about using Tesla as a shining example to convince the world that a sustainable economy is achievable. Again, quite grand! But Tesla went so deep on specifics that it released a 41-page white paper backing up its projections. The company and the world have, almost by definition, not accomplished much of what is included in that paper. In the meantime, Musk spent $300 million to help elect a president who is actively fighting the adoption of cleaner, cheaper, sustainable energy. Musk spent the last few years trying to redefine Tesla. It’s not a carmaker, it’s an AI and robotics company, he says repeatedly. There’s some truth to that, though it doesn’t change the fact that the overwhelming majority of the company’s revenue still comes from the (increasingly hard) business of making and selling electric vehicles. The belief that Tesla will complete this transition is a huge driver of its stock price, so it’s beneficial for the company to lean way into the idea. So of course Master Plan 4 is wide-eyed. But Tesla used to back up those ambitions with goals and benchmarks that it could be measured against. And Musk used to at least try to argue the case. He wrote the first two plans and spent four hours on a stage with other executives diving into the details of the more professionalized third version. This time around, Tesla’s “Master Plan” was published on a federal holiday, and its CEO spent the day spreading fear about marginalized people.

    "content": "Model 3 and Model Y owners can now have a “self-healing urethane-based film” installed by Tesla. It costs $7,500 – $8,000 and is only compatible with 2023+ models. The range of colors available include blue, green, gold, white, black, red and, for some reason, grey. Or, for $5,000, Tesla will install a clear wrap, protecting the vehicle’s original paint and body. The service is currently only offered at Tesla Service Centers in West Covina, California and Carlsbad, California. Similar vinyl wraps have long been applied to vehicles, but this is the first time they have been offered by a major vehicle manufacturer as an after-purchase service. These wraps can be applied in a few hours and offer owners a relatively low-cost and easy option to radically change the look of their vehicle. Tesla only offers wraps in solid colors; third-party services will print basically anything on a wrap. This product doesn’t come as a surprise. Several Cybertruck prototypes have been spotted sporting various wraps, including ones that mimic the designs of the Ford F-150 and Toyota Tundra. Others were spotted wearing various forms of camouflage. These wraps could be how Tesla addresses major concerns around the Cybertruck. As Tesla notes, these urethane-based films feature self-healing properties that would provide extra protection on the Cybertruck’s scratch-prone stainless steel body. And if the wrap rips, tears or gets beat up, the owner can replace just the damaged section, or replace the entire wrap, changing the look of the vehicle in the process. Of course, this is all speculation as Tesla has yet to announce these wraps for the Cybertruck. Several outfitters already announced plans to offer wraps for the Cybertruck, and launched configurators to let potential buyers explore the options.

    "content": "Elon Musk has long been credited with turning Tesla into a beacon of innovation, the visionary who pushed the world into an era of electrification. But his slide into politics — specifically his alignment with President Trump and activities within the federal government — has dragged Tesla into uncertainty. For many would-be Tesla buyers, the brand has lost its progressive luster. And while Musk has long been the face of Tesla, that link has taken a negative turn as the billionaire oversees mass layoffs and the elimination of federal programs via the Department of Government Efficiency. Tesla’s disappointing first-quarter earnings, which saw profits drop 71% amid weakened sales and anti-Musk sentiment, demonstrate just how much the brand has fallen out of favor. The company reported 336,681 deliveries in the first three months of 2025, down from 495,570 in Q4 2024 and 386,810 in the first quarter of last year. That’s off the back of an unimpressive 2024, which saw fewer deliveries than the year prior amid production delays and increased EV competition. For many, Musk’s political activities have turned Tesla into a symbolic pariah. Tesla trade-ins have hit record highs, while sales in Europe have dropped. Foreign leaders are calling for boycotts and the automaker’s stock price has lost about half its value since December. All the while, protesters continue to assemble outside Tesla showrooms, dealerships, and even charging stations in an effort to accelerate the automaker’s brand devaluation and with it, they hope, Musk’s wealth. “They have a certain significant public image problem that’s really something we haven’t seen before in this industry,” Sean Tucker, lead editor at Kelley Blue Book, told TechCrunch. Even one of Tesla’s most unwavering bulls, Dan Ives, has begged Musk to focus less on politics and more on his business “or else unfortunately darker times are ahead for Tesla.” And even though Musk said last month that he’d take a step back from DOGE, he’s not giving up on it either. To combat the effect this might have on Tesla, Musk has and likely will continue to lean on his sales pitch that Tesla isn’t an automaker, it’s an AI company, one that will someday commercialize autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. The question now is whether the Tesla brand can recover. Below are the moments, which TechCrunch will continue to update, that are shaping perception of the Tesla brand and may have a lasting effect on its future. Tesla’s new car sales have plunged across Europe, even as sales of electric cars made by other brands rose on the continent. In the first four months of 2025, Tesla sales dropped 37.2% in Europe, and in Sweden, they dropped 81% year-over-year. Germany, traditionally one of Tesla’s largest markets and home to one of its gigafactories, has turned against Musk in a big way. A recent survey of 100,000 Germans found 94% would never purchase a Tesla, and sales data backs that up. In March 2025, Tesla’s Germany sales were down 42.5%. A slight increase from the 75% sales slump in February. The Wall Street Journal reported in May that Tesla’s board began searching for Musk’s potential successor sometime around early April as Musk waded further into Washington to slash government spending. When the report came out, Tesla chair Robyn Denholm declared the WSJ’s reporting to be “absolutely false.” Either way, the report does raise questions about succession planning if Musk-associated brand devaluation continues. Musk said during Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call that he would take a step back from DOGE, but, importantly, he also said he’d continue working for the agency for the remainder of Trump’s presidency. “Tesla Takedown” protests have been spreading around the world with the goal of encouraging people to stop buying Teslas and to sell their Tesla stock, which protesters say will hurt Musk where he holds most of his power — in his wallet (more on those below). As of the first quarter of this year, those protests have officially become an official risk in Tesla’s regulatory filings. The new risk factor in Tesla’s latest SEC filings warns that certain criticism “has incited protests, some escalating to violence targeting our operations, products and personnel.” Tesla’s lawyers also expanded what’s at risk, saying negative perceptions resulting from the protests, along with the broader criticism of the company, “may harm our brand and our business (including sales) and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed.” While Tesla is the automaker best positioned to parry the blow of Trump’s automotive tariffs in the U.S., the company is still exposed due to Musk’s alliance with the president. In April, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives cut Tesla’s price target to $315, down from $550, once again citing Musk’s politics creating a brand crisis for the automaker. He also noted that Musk’s association with Trump, and therefore his tariff policies, are not only affecting sales in the U.S. and Europe, but also threatening Tesla’s popularity in China, “further driv[ing] Chinese consumers to buy domestic such as BYD.” While recent studies found that Musk’s political leanings have lost him customers in what has historically been Tesla’s base — Democrats — the shift has garnered him street cred with Republicans. One study from researchers at Northeastern University, Columbia University, and the University of Iowa found that Republicans’ likelihood to purchase a Tesla moved up from 7% before Musk’s Trump endorsement to 10.2% after. That sentiment might only increase amid Trump’s reciprocal endorsement of Musk and Tesla, including his free commercial at the White House on March 11. At an impromptu, glitchy, livestreamed Tesla all-hands presentation on the evening of March 20, Musk told his employees and investors to “hang on to [their] stock” despite it feeling “like Armageddon.” “It’s very difficult for people in the stock market, especially those that look in the rearview mirror, which is most people, to imagine a future where suddenly a 10 million vehicle fleet has five to 10 times the usefulness,” Musk said, referring to the now-defunct claim that all existing Teslas have the hardware necessary to turn into fully self-driving cars with a mere software update. He advised employees to tune out the noise and focus on building the Cybercab, which would be the new priority. The Cybercab is a two-seater robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedals. Current federal regulations don’t allow for the mass production of such vehicles because they don’t have human controls, but Musk has signaled an intent to amend those rules. He noted that the Cybercab manufacturing process would be a feat of engineering, a “high-speed consumer electronics line” that “will move so fast that … it’ll be able to produce a car, ultimately, in less than five seconds.” During the call, Musk also promised to produce about 5,000 Optimus robots this year, which he believes will be Tesla’s most valuable asset. On the same day as the sudden all-hands, Tesla bull Dan Ives wrote in a note that Musk’s involvement in DOGE has led to a “brand tornado crisis moment for Musk and Tesla.” “If you agree or disagree with DOGE it misses the point that by Musk spending 110% of his time with DOGE (and not as Tesla CEO) since President Trump got back into the White House this has essentially turned Tesla into a political symbol … and this is a bad thing,” Ives wrote. Tesla showrooms, charging stations, facilities, and even privately owned vehicles have been hit with attacks. In some cases, the damage is minimal — some spray paint and a keyed car. In others, violence has ensued. Dealerships have been hit with bullets and Molotov cocktails, and charging stations have been set on fire. Musk has responded by questioning why anyone would want to hurt Tesla. Trump’s response has been more pointed. He has declared that any acts of violence — which could include spray-painting — would be treated by the federal government as domestic terrorism. “I look forward to watching the sick terrorist thugs get 20-year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla. Perhaps they could serve them in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions!” Trump said on his social media platform, Truth Social. As of the time of this writing, the Department of Justice has brought charges against three individuals who are allegedly responsible for violent destruction of Tesla properties. Peaceful protests have also erupted across the country as part of the Tesla Takedown movement. Protesters have been showing up at Tesla dealerships and showrooms to try to discourage people from buying Tesla cars. They also aim to encourage Tesla owners to trade in their vehicles and Tesla stockholders to sell their shares. Despite these protests being peaceful, we’re beginning to see the start of violent counterprotests — like the Florida man who drove his SUV into a crowd of protestors outside a Palm Beach Tesla dealership in March. Thousands of people joined in Tesla Takedown protests the last weekend in March at showrooms across the country. The crowds drew small numbers of counterprotests in some regions that were peopled mainly by MAGA supporters, Wired reports. Among them were far-right extremists, including members of the Proud Boys and armed militias. While speaking at a rally celebrating Trump’s inauguration in January, Musk did what many have perceived to be not one, but two, Nazi salutes. The damage has only been amplified by Musk’s vocal support for the far-right German political party AfD, as well as his history of sharing antisemitic posts. Shortly after the salute incident, activists projected an image of Musk doing the salute, along with the word “Heil,” onto Tesla’s Berlin gigafactory. One of Tesla’s biggest competitors, China’s BYD, has been touting significant breakthroughs in charging. The automaker said this week that its new cars can be charged in five minutes, which would give it a huge competitive edge over Tesla and indeed any other EV maker. China is one of Tesla’s largest markets, but BYD is continuing to bully the automaker on its home turf. BYD recently unveiled its “God’s Eye” advanced driver-assistance system — akin to Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD — that will be installed at no additional cost on its entire EV lineup, including its ultra-cheap $9,600 Seagull hatchback. BYD continues to impress consumers with its high-tech range of EVs and hybrids and has once again surpassed Tesla on revenue. In 2024, BYD reported $107 billion in revenue compared to Tesla’s $97.7 billion. Tesla has languished with an aging lineup for years. The Cybertruck was meant to be the automaker’s next big bet that would prove it’s still capable of delivering innovative new models. And indeed, the truck has been popular among American buyers. Still, Tesla has issued eight recalls on the Cybertruck since launching the vehicle in November 2023. Most recently, Tesla had to recall 46,000 Cybertrucks because of an exterior steel trim panel on the side of the windshield that looks like it was stuck on with superglue and can just peel off.

    "content": "Tesla has revealed a new-look Model Y meant for the Chinese and other Asian-Pacific markets, marking the first major update to the SUV since its launch in 2020. The redesign comes as Tesla finished 2024 having delivered fewer vehicles than it did in 2023. It was the first year-over-year drop since the company started selling mass market cars in 2012. The new Model Y is slated to start deliveries as early as March in China and some surrounding countries. It’s not yet clear when Tesla will bring this version to Europe and the U.S., though it took around four months for that to happen with the updated Model 3 last year. The changes to the new Model Y — which was internally codenamed Juniper — track pretty closely to the ones Tesla made to its Model 3 sedan in 2023, while also borrowing some design elements from the company’s other projects. The front end is less bubbly and has a sharper edge to it, like the new Model 3. The new Model Y also eschews the bug-eye headlights for a continuous light bar running across the front — a design seen on the Cybertruck and the prototype of the Cybercab. Tesla also ditched the traditional taillights in favor of a singular light that stretches across the rear of the car under a small protrusion in the hatch. Tesla claims this “cross-car lamp” is the “first indirect reflective body panel taillight of its kind.” Inside, the Model Y refresh has the same ambient light bar found in the new Model 3, which wraps around most of the cabin and can be changed to different colors. There are powered rear seats and a new touchscreen display for rear passengers, and Tesla says the suspension has been improved and that road noise has been reduced. The SUV is a few pounds lighter than its predecessor and can eke out a few more miles, but it does not seem to offer a radical jump in range or efficiency.Overall, the new design more closely matches the look of a lot of Chinese EVs — competitors that have inspired a price war and taken market share from Tesla despite record sales in the country. Tesla has now updated all four of its core EVs — the Model Y, the Model 3, the Model S, and the Model X — in the last few years. The only truly new product since the Model Y has been the Cybertruck, which is struggling to reach a mass market of buyers. Tesla has teased the release of a mysterious new model (or models) later this year. But while that model is expected to be cheaper than the Model 3 and Model Y, it is not going to start at $25,000.

    "content": "Drew Baglino, Tesla’s SVP of Powertrain and Energy, and Rohan Patel, VP of Public Policy and Business Development, have left the company, Patel told TechCrunch. Patel said he decided to leave because of “[b]ig overall changes” at the company that he declined to specify. Their departures were first reported by Bloomberg. “Good for me and hopefully also good for Tesla,” Patel said in a message to TechCrunch. “Had an amazing run and accomplished way more than I could’ve ever imagined, as a result of working with the best policy/bizdev team in the business.” Baglino said in a post on X that it was a “difficult decision” to leave after 18 years at Tesla. Tesla CEO Elon Musk thanked both of them for their time at the company in posts on his social media platform, X. Their departures come as Tesla is laying off thousands of employees in a bid to cut costs and boost productivity, according to an internal email sent to staff by Musk, which Electrek and Bloomberg News first reported. The electric automaker is cutting “more than 10%” of its global headcount, Musk said in the email. Tesla finished 2023 with over 140,000 employees, meaning the cuts could impact more than 14,000 people. Musk announced the layoffs just two weeks after Tesla reported its first year-over-year drop in sales in three years, amid a wider cooling of demand for EVs. The company has warned investors that sales growth could be “notably lower” in 2024 than its stated goal of 50% growth each year. It’s also somewhat in between product cycles for the first time in years, with the expensive Cybertruck only just recently going into production and the popular Model Y entering its fourth year without any significant updates. “As we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity,” Musk said in the email. Tesla’s growth, he said, has led to “duplication of roles and job functions in certain areas.” “As part of this effort, we have done a thorough review of the organization and made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by more than 10% globally. There is nothing I hate more, but it must be done. This will enable us to be lean, innovative and hungry for the next growth phase cycle,” Musk wrote. Baglino’s departure is the second time a top executive has left the company in the past year, as Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn stepped down in August 2023. Baglino oversaw engineering for the company’s powertrain and battery technologies. He also had become one of the more responsive executives on Musk’s social media platform. Patel, who spent years as a special assistant to President Barack Obama and an advisor on climate and energy, was similarly engaging with Tesla customers and fans in recent months. Tesla shipped a record 1.8 million EVs in 2023. But the company spent much of the year slashing prices on its most popular models in an effort to counterbalance the impact of high interest rates and increased global competition. The company has also reportedly dropped — or at the very least, delayed — plans to build a lower-cost EV that would retail starting at around $25,000, opting instead to use the underlying platform being developed to power an alleged robotaxi that Musk said will debut on August 8.

This time, it’s because the rearview camera image may be delayed by two seconds after shifting into reverse, and the display may appear blank for up to eight seconds when the vehicle is in reverse, according to a report Tesla shared with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Around 27,185 Cybertrucks are potentially impacted. Tesla has already released an over-the-air software update to Cybertruck owners. The news comes four months after a June recall to fix potentially loose trim pieces and defective windshield wipers. In April, some Cybertrucks were recalled due to a sticky accelerator pedal. Tesla launched the steel-clad, sci-fi-looking Cybertruck in November 2023 to refresh its lineup. The automaker last introduced the Model Y five years ago.

    "content": "SpaceX has long marketed Starship as a fully and rapidly reusable rocket that’s designed to deliver thousands of pounds of cargo to Mars and make life multiplanetary. But reusability at scale means a space vehicle that can tolerate mishaps and faults, so that a single failure doesn’t spell a mission-ending catastrophe. The 10th test flight on Tuesday evening demonstrated SpaceX’s focus on fault tolerance. In a post-flight update, SpaceX said the test stressed “the limits of vehicle capabilities.” Understanding these edges will be critical for the company’s plans to eventually use Starship to launch Starlink satellites, commercial payloads, and eventually astronauts. When the massive Starship rocket lifted off on its 10th test flight Tuesday evening, SpaceX did more than achieve new milestones. It purposefully introduced several faults to test the heat shield, propulsion redundancy, and the relighting of its Raptor engine. The heat shield is among the toughest engineering challenges facing SpaceX. As Elon Musk acknowledged on X in May 2024, a reusable orbital return heat shield is the “biggest remaining problem” to 100% rocket reusability. The belly of the upper stage, also called Starship, is covered in thousands of hexagonal ceramic and metallic tiles, which make up the heat shield. Flight 10 was all about learning how much damage the ship can accept and survive when it goes through atmospheric heating. During the tenth test, engineers intentionally removed tiles from some sections of the ship, and experimented with a new type of actively cooled tile, to gather real-world data and refine designs. The Space Shuttle Columbia provided an unwelcome lesson on thermal shield vulnerability in 2003. A piece of insulating foam struck the thermal tiles on the left wing of Columbia, a critical error during liftoff that ended up killing all seven astronauts onboard upon reentry. Twenty-two years on, SpaceX is focused on mapping performance even in worst-case scenarios. If post-flight data shows the ship stayed within anticipated temperature margins, it pushes the company forward toward the eventual goal of landing the stage upright to be refurbished and reused. Propulsion redundancy was also put to the test. The Super Heavy booster’s landing burn configuration appeared to be a rehearsal for engine failure. Engineers intentionally disabled one of the three center Raptor engines during the final phase of the burn and used a backup engine in its place. That was a successful rehearsal for an engine-out event. Finally, SpaceX reported the in-space relight of a Raptor engine, described on the launch broadcast as the second time SpaceX has pulled this off. Reliable engine restarts will be necessary for deep-space missions, propellant transfers, and possibly some payload deployment missions. NASA’s Artemis program hinges on SpaceX developing a heat shield that survives reentry, and a ship that can reliably relight on orbit, in order to deliver astronauts safely to the lunar surface. The agency has awarded SpaceX just over $4 billion for a version of Starship that can land on the moon; the first Starship lunar landing is currently scheduled for mid-2027. NASA calibrates risks differently according to the mission profile, accepting a higher degree of risk on uncrewed service missions and a very low risk for crewed transport. The agency sets quantitative safety targets that must be demonstrated via testing and flight data before it will put astronauts on a new rocket. Those levels don’t change for Starship just because it is a larger rocket, but it does mean more potential failure modes. Viewed together, these experiments indicate that SpaceX is testing with these standards in mind. The company will introduce many more changes with the next version of Starship, called Block 3, including a higher-thrust Raptor engine, upgrades to the flaps, and updates to avionics and guidance, navigation and control systems. The next step is translating Flight 10 data into future hardware upgrades to move closer to routine operations and days when, as Musk envisioned, “Starship launches more than 24 times in 24 hours.” Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "content": "The Federal Aviation Administration has cleared SpaceX to perform the ninth test flight of its Starship rocket system, following back-to-back explosions earlier this year. The agency said Thursday it is “expanding the size of hazard areas both in the U.S. and other countries” for the flight based on an updated safety analysis provided by SpaceX. The Starship vehicle mishaps from Flights 7 and 8 caused a greater probability of failure of the vehicle and, therefore, a larger hazard area. Hazard areas are, essentially, temporary no-fly zones the FAA establishes when the potential for impact with debris exists. The new hazard area drawn up by the FAA covers around 1,600 nautical miles running eastward from Texas and through the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos, where debris from the previous two test flights landed. That’s roughly double the size of the hazard area the FAA used for the most recent Starship test flight in March. The FAA said it is also requiring SpaceX perform the test flight during “non-peak” travel periods, after the previous two Starship mishaps forced the agency to divert dozens of domestic and international flights. SpaceX has been testing its Starship system for two years now from the launch complex the company built in southern Texas. CEO Elon Musk has claimed the ultimate purpose of the system is to send people to Mars, but the short-term aim for Starship is to allow SpaceX to launch even more of its Starlink satellites into orbit around Earth. SpaceX also says it will use Starship “to provide greater mission capability to NASA and the Department of Defense.” To date, SpaceX has used its workhorse Falcon 9 to launch Starlink satellites. In fact, most Falcon 9 launches these days are all about Starlink. But while Starlink has already become an internet provider in high demand, it’s possible there could be an even greater need for launch capacity as the Trump administration reportedly pushes other countries to adopt the service as leverage in its myriad trade wars. Members of Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency are reportedly helping the agency test Starlink terminals as a potential solution for the FAA’s trouble with the current air traffic control system.

    "content": "SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket could take to the skies for the fourth time on June 5, with the primary objective of evaluating the second stage’s reusable heat shield as the vehicle tries to safely reenter the atmosphere for the first time. CEO Elon Musk said on his social media platform X that “There are many tough issues to solve with this vehicle, but the biggest remaining problem is making a reusable orbital return heat shield, which has never been done before.” His post echoes comments he made earlier this month when he noted that the primary goal of the next Starship test was “getting through max reentry heating.” That means the second stage’s novel heat shield, composed of around 18,000 ceramic hexagonal tiles, will be put to the test. Those tiles are designed to protect the second stage (which is also called Starship) from the extreme temperatures experienced when reentering Earth’s atmosphere. One of the biggest issues, Musk suggested, is the vulnerability of the system overall: “we are not resilient to loss of a single tile in most places,” he said. That means a single damaged or faulty tile could lead to catastrophe. As Musk noted in his post, surviving reentry is just one part of the puzzle. The company will also need to establish an “entirely new supply chain” for the high-performance heat shield tiles, and manufacture them at a very high volume. It’s a tough problem, but solving it would move them closer to the holy grail of launch vehicles: full reusability. SpaceX made major headway in reusability with its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket — which has flown 56 times so far this year alone — but although the company recovers the booster, the second stage is expended in its target orbit. By reusing both stages of the rocket, SpaceX is hoping to drive down costs to a fraction of what they are today, all while delivering many orders of magnitude more mass to orbit in a single launch. (SpaceX’s Transporter rideshare missions cost $6,000 per kilogram.) If all goes to plan, the company will demonstrate the ability to return Starship to Earth via a controlled reentry and a soft splashdown in the Indian Ocean. SpaceX is also aiming to return the booster, called Super Heavy, also via ocean splashdown. And it will get one step closer to bringing the largest and most powerful launch system ever built online, ready to transport cargo and eventually crew to Earth’s orbit and beyond. This next Starship launch will be the fourth in a series of orbital flight tests that kicked off last April. Before the launch can move ahead, SpaceX must receive a commercial launch license from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, the agency responsible for regulating commercial launch operations. The FAA also oversees investigations into rocket launches that go awry for any reason, and so it’s been working closely with SpaceX throughout the Starship test campaign. And the previous Starship launches have certainly gone awry: The first two ended in fiery mid-air explosions, and the third concluded when both Super Heavy and Starship likely disintegrated before hitting the ocean. But for SpaceX, which takes an iterative approach to hardware development, each test was ultimately a success because they furnished engineers with data on the rocket in a real-world flight environment. And it’s true that each mission has gone farther than the one previous: During the third flight, the engines pulled off full-duration burns as the vehicle ascended, and Starship ultimately reached orbit for the first time. Eventually, SpaceX aims to land both the Super Heavy booster and Starship second stage at its launch facility in southeast Texas, where they can be rapidly refurbished and returned to the pad.

    "content": "The Federal Aviation Administration is requiring Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin to investigate what went wrong on their respective mega-rocket test flights this week. The regulator said both companies must perform what’s known as a “mishap investigation.” These probes involve the companies and the FAA working together to understand what went wrong, why it went wrong, and take corrective action. In both cases, the regulator will have to sign off on the companies before those rockets can fly again. It’s not immediately clear how long that will take. In SpaceX’s case, there was an explosion during the seventh test-flight of its Starship rocket system, which launched from Boca Chica, Texas on Thursday. Musk wrote on X that the Starship itself became over-pressurized due to excess gas as it ascended into space, and it ultimately exploded. The company’s official explanation on its website says the inside of the ship caught fire. Starship’s destruction created a debris field that lit up the skies over the islands of Turks and Caicos, prompting the FAA to slow and even divert some flights in the nearby airspace as a result of low fuel levels. There are no reports of injuries, according to the FAA, but the regulator said it’s working with SpaceX to “confirm reports of public property damage on Turks and Caicos.” SpaceX and the FAA already seem to be at odds on one particular detail about the explosion. The FAA technically activated what’s known as a “Debris Response Area,” which the administration says it only does if pieces of the spacecraft fall outside of hazard areas that are defined prior to a launch. SpaceX insists on its website that “[a]ny surviving pieces of debris would have fallen into the designated hazard area.” Hours before SpaceX’s rocket launch, Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket took off from Cape Canaveral, Florida for the first time ever. The upper stage of the New Glenn rocket successfully made it into orbit, but the booster exploded on its way back down for an attempted landing on a drone ship at sea. The FAA says it is “aware an anomaly occurred during the Blue Origin” mission, and that no injuries or public property damage have been reported.

    "content": "SpaceX will conduct the sixth flight test of Starship, the largest rocket ever built, as soon as November 18, following the smooth success of the previous mission less than a month ago. The high flight cadence is thanks, in part, to that success, which included the first-ever return of the Super Heavy booster to the launch site — where massive “chopstick” arms jutting from the launch tower caught it in mid-air — and a controlled, on-target splashdown after suborbital flight of the Starship upper stage in the Indian Ocean. This sixth test includes many of the same objectives; this fact led the Federal Aviation Administration to approve both flight 5 and 6 at the same time last month. Up until this point, SpaceX has needed to wait (sometimes months) for regulatory approval before each Starship launch. In a post on its website, SpaceX says it will attempt to re-create these same successes on November 18, including catching the booster at the launch site and an accurate Starship splashdown. The company will also continue to test the heat shield and maneuvers for the upper-stage reentry, “to expand the envelope on ship and booster capabilities and get closer to bringing reuse of the entire system online.” Engineers also introduced a number of upgrades to the system, including more redundancy in the booster propulsion system, updated software controls, and other changes. SpaceX will also attempt to relight one of the Ship’s six Raptor engines on orbit, a key capability to eventually also reuse the Starship upper stage. Engineers will put this stage through its paces in other ways as well: The company will test new secondary thermal protection materials. In addition, as the company put it, “The ship also will intentionally fly at a higher angle of attack in the final phase of descent, purposefully stressing the limits of flap control to gain data on future landing profiles.” All this testing will culminate in “significant upgrades” to the ship, starting with flight 7, like redesigned flaps, larger propellant tanks, and the most up-to-date thermal protection. A live webcast of the test will start around 30 minutes before the 30-minute launch window at 2 p.m. PT, which will be viewable on X or SpaceX’s website. This late-afternoon launch window (which opens at 4 p.m. local Texas time) will enable better viewing conditions upon reentry, SpaceX said.

It's stacked full of top features like a fully rotating camera, Return To Home that doesn't require GPS and video and stills of 6K and 100MP, respectively. It's an upgrade in every way on the previous Mavic 3 Pro. If you're looking for a camera drone, this is pretty special as it features three cameras. The main camera is a Four Thirds Hasselblad which features a 28mm equivalent focal length and an adjustable f/2.0-f/11 aperture. There's also a 70mm equivalent camera with a 48MP/12MP 1/1.3-inch sensor and the 168mm equivalent camera uses a 50MP/12.5MP 1/1.5 in. sensor. In short, it can take stills in a resolution of up to 100MP and it can capture video in 6K up to 30FPS, 4K up to 120FPS. Its design is pretty handy too. While it is heavier than the Mavic 3, it does fold effectively, meaning you can transport it easily. The battery also lasts for 51 minutes of flight time, although we found it's more like 37 minutes when capturing footage. It also comes with a new DJI RC 2 smart controller which features a 2000-nit 7-inch high-bright Mini-LED display. The Mavic 4 Pro also includes a host of handy features. The Return To Home now doesn't require GPS, it can achieve speeds of up to 60.4mph in sports mode and it can track targets moving up to 40.3. It also has a normal and a cine mode as well as improved obstacle sensing and collision avoidance. It will resist winds of up to 26.8mph when hovering too. Overall, The DJI Mavic 4 Pro is a cut above the Mavic Pro 3 and everything else the market has to offer. It's well suited for professional use with its superb camera capabilities and the range of useful features on offer. It's also surprisingly easy to use, meaning those without much experience can get to grips with it too. We think this is the best drone overall available today. An excellent folding design with complete camera rotation. Improved Return To Home, obstacle avoidance and subject tracking 6K video, 100MP resolution stills, 51-minute battery life and a 60.4mph top speed ✅ You're looking for versatility: The three cameras on offer on this drone give you the ability to shoot different perspectives and different focal lengths at the same time, which can help produce more creative content. ✅ You want to shoot high-quality slow-mo: With this drone, you don't have to choose between quality and frame rates. You can shoot 5.1K up to 75fps, 4K up to 120fps and FHD up to 200fps. ❌ You're on a budget: With all the features on offer, this is quite an expensive drone and may be overkill for casual hobbyists. 🔎 DJI Mavic 3 Pro One of the best foldable drones on the market, this allows you to get stunning videos and offers great flexibility with three cameras that can film at the same time. The only real downside is the price, but we think beginners and pros would be pleased with this purchase. ★★★★★ While the DJI Mavic 4 Pro may have surpassed this predecessor, the Mavic 3 Pro could be the drone for you if you like an all-rounder with features, functionality and camera performance that will suit the requirements of most pilots. With three cameras, you're spoilt for creative choice and although this is a prosumer drone, it's a great option for beginners, too. Check out our DJI Mavic 3 Pro review, where you can discover more about this impressive model. It features a 24mm Four Thirds Hasselblad camera which captures images at 20MP. Its aperture is adjustable from f/2.8 and f/11, suitable for a wide range of situations and photographic effects, and you can also record video up to 5.1K. On either side of the Hasselblad, you'll find a 70mm medium telephoto camera and a 166mm telephoto, having a wide range of zoom lengths covered. It features the hallmark Mavic folding design, and like the other models, we found it could provide around 30 minutes of flight time. It also comes with two different smart controller options, both featuring 5.5-inch touchscreens, so there's no need to hook up your smartphone. The Mavic 3 Pro is very intuitive and easy to fly for a drone of this class since it comes with a number of flight and safety features such as Advanced Return to Home, AirSense ADS-B to detect aircraft, GEO 2.0 geofencing, obstacle sensing and automated flight patterns for video. This is a high-end drone with many possible applications for both professionals and enthusiasts. It's certainly not an inexpensive drone, but you're paying for the best available and it's priced similarly to older models at launch which is fair. So, if you're looking for a powerful and feature-packed drone with fantastic cameras, the DJI Mavic 3 Pro is the one for you. Three cameras and two smart controllers Easy to fly, with obstacle sensing technology Excellent image quality and videos up to 5.1K ✅ You desire excellent image quality: The image quality produced by the two cameras is excellent, and the main wide-angle camera with the 1-inch sensor is impressive. ✅ You require advanced collision avoidance: Collision avoidance is an incredibly useful feature when flying in complex environments. This also assists with advanced Return to Home and subject tracking. ❌ You'd prefer a regulator-friendly drone: With the weight of the Air 3S it's more regulated in the US, UK and other regions so for simplicity, a sub-250 g model may be more suitable for you. 🔎 The DJI Air 3S is a dual-camera drone providing excellent image quality across wide-angle and telephoto focal lengths. It also offers impressive features including advanced collision avoidance, advanced Return to Home and impressive subject tracking performance. ★★★★½ The DJI Air 3S is a folding medium-sized drone that sits between the sub-250 g DJI Mini 4 Pro and DJI Mavic 3 Pro in terms of price and camera functionality, but it also manages to overtake the higher-end model with some useful new features. It's a fantastic drone overall and it's fair to say that it's one of the best available thanks to its features and impressive dual camera. The Air 3S features a 50MP 1-inch CMOS in the 24mm equivalent main camera, while the 70mm equivalent medium telephoto uses a 48MP 1/1.3-inch CMOS. As we stated in our DJI Air 3S review, they provide a huge amount of versatility and image quality is excellent overall with the larger sensor naturally being the most impressive of the two. Video can be captured in flat color profiles for color grading and a larger dynamic range, as well as the standard profile for straight-out-of-camera footage. Video can be captured up to 4K 120 FPS, 1080p up to 240 FPS and 2.7 vertical video up to 60 FPS. Photos can be captured in Raw and JPEG at 12MP and the full resolution of each sensor. The Air 3S also features advanced collision avoidance, including forward-facing LiDAR for night flying, impressive subject tracking, Off-state Quick Transfer and it can be connected to 4G using the DJI Cellular Dongle 2 and a SIM card for more secure and reliable connectivity in complex environments. Two impressive cameras and a folding design. Image quality from both cameras is fantastic. ✅ You want excellent image quality at a more affordable price: This drone contains the same impressive Hasselblad 20MP camera as the other DJI Mavic 3 models, but keeps the price down by doing away with the additional cameras. ✅ You want something easy to fly: With two different controller options and an Advanced Return to Home feature, you should be able to get the hang of this drone quite quickly. ❌ You're after an affordable beginner drone: While this is more affordable than the other DJI Mavic 3 drones, it's still quite pricey and there are several other cheaper options on the market for beginners. 🔎 DJI Mavic 3 Classic This is a great option for people who want the image quality of the DJI Mavic 3 drones without paying extra for additional cameras that they don't have need for. Although it's still not cheap, it's easy to fly and would make a good investment for keen beginners. ★★★★½ The DJI Mavic 3 Classic features only the impressive 24mm equivalent lens, adjustable aperture and Four Thirds sensor to offer excellent image quality for photos and videos. Many drone pilots only require a wide-angle camera, so the Mavic 3 Classic meets this need while delivering flagship performance for a lower cost. The camera on here is the excellent 24mm Hasselblad camera, capable of capturing 20MP stills or 5.1K video, so you're getting the best-of-the-best in terms of image quality. You can shoot in either JPEG or Raw, adjust the aperture between f/2.8 and f/11 and make use of a 3x digital zoom. There are two controller options with this drone, depending on your budget. You can opt for a controller with a retractable phone holder or pay a bit more to get a smart controller with a 5.5-inch touchscreen, which in our DJI Mavic 3 Classic review, we found improved the overall user experience. This drone has the typical foldable design of the Mavic range and flight time was around 30 minutes during our testing. Even beginners will be able to get the hang of flying this drone quickly, thanks to all the onboard flight assistance. The Mavic 3 Classic features Advanced Return to Home, obstacle avoidance using multiple vision sensors and the highly effective ActiveTrack 5.0 for subject tracking. The High-Speed Quick Transfer feature also makes it super easy to share your results with clients or on social media since you can transfer files to your smartphone over WiFi at a rate of 80MB/s. If you don't need a second or third camera, you can make a decent saving on this drone in comparison to the other Mavic 3 drones without losing many of their other great features and functionality. What's more, the camera on offer is the best available on any consumer drone. Single Hasselblad 20MP camera and controller options Easy to fly, with good safety features Fantastic image quality with 12.8 stops of dynamic range ✅ You're looking for value for money: This drone is very well made and boasts some impressive features and a good camera, all for a comparatively affordable price. ❌ You want a larger and more powerful drone: While the Potensic Atom 2 packs a punch, there are larger, more powerful and more advanced drones available. 🔎 Autel Evo Lite+ This drone is a fantastic sub-250g drone with plenty of useful features, a very well-made design and a good camera. Yes, there are some caveats, but no dealbreakers and it offers great value for money. ★★★★ New for 2025, the Potensic Atom 2 is an affordable entry point into the world of drones for those looking for genuine quality. We think it's the best DJI alternative on the market as it boasts plenty of performance and fortunately, you don't have to break the bank to have one. DJI is a market leader in the drone industry, but not everyone will want to own one of their models. This can be due to any number of reasons, one of which can be cost. So, a retail price starting at $330 for a standard kit can seem attractive to those looking for a mid-range drone that performs well. After all, the Potensic Atom 2 does boast features and specs that seriously impress. The drone features a 12/48MP Sony 1/2 in CMOS sensor, which means it can capture images with 48MP or up to 8K. The caveat is that those images are only in JPEG format. It will also capture video in 4K up to 30FPS, so there's more than enough quality on show. You'll also find some handy features in this drone, like Return to Home and Steady Hover. Sport mode will enable speeds of over 35mph and a level 5 wind resistance means oncoming winds of around 23mph shouldn't affect the drone's positioning. The gimbal tilt is smooth and users will have the ability to shoot time-lapse and slow-mo video, as well as make the most of AI subject tracking and quickshots. Overall, we think the Potensic Atom 2 is a great drone and great value for money. Sure, there are more premium options available but this will do a lot of the things you want, is very well made and competes with the best mid-range options on the market. New for 2025, it's certainly a DJI alternative to consider. High-quality folding design with 12/48MP Sony 1/2 in CMOS sensor Level 5 wind resistance, subject tracking and Return to Home Excellent image quality with up to 4K video ✅ You want a regulator-friendly drone: Sun-250g drones are subject to fewer restrictions than larger drones, which means they’re able to be flown with less fuss. ✅ You need a fully featured sub-250g drone: The DJI Mini 4 Pro offers features comparable to the flagship DJI Mavic 3 prosumer models making it the best sub-250g drone by far. ❌ You need higher wind resistance: The Mini 4 Pro can handle reasonably strong wind, but the larger and more powerful DJI Air 3 and Mavic 3 models are much more adept in stronger winds. ❌ You need dual cameras: The Mini 4 Pro has one excellent camera offering an equivalent focal length of 24mm, but the DJI Air 3 offers dual 24mm and 70mm cameras for added versatility. 🔎 The DJI Mini 4 Pro is the best sub-250g drone to date, offering advanced pro-spec features and excellent image quality. Plus, not only is it perfect for professionals, it’s a great option for beginners, too.★★★★½ Sub-250 g drones are incredibly popular due to their small size and light weight, not to mention that they're regulator-friendly in most regions. And with the DJI Mini 4 Pro, you get some seriously impressive features and functionality that's more commonly seen on DJI's flagship models. We were hugely impressed in our hands-on DJI Mini 4 Pro review, where this small but fully featured drone is a firm favourite. Advanced features include Omnidirectional Obstacle Avoidance, improved subject tracking, Advanced Return to Home, and several video upgrades. The drone is easy to set up and fly, which is great for beginners and experienced pilots, while the Mini 4 Pro is a smooth and responsive flier. The image sensor and camera are the same as the Mini 3 / Mini 3 Pro, so image quality is similar, although image processing is claimed to have been improved. Image quality produced by the 48MP 1/1.3-inch sensor is fantastic given the small size of the sensor, and high ISO handling is outstanding. The lens produces an equivalent focal length of 24mm and the fixed f/1.7 aperture is fantastic for low-light shooting but still captures a large depth-of-field. One of the most useful aspects of the camera is that it can be rotated 90 degrees to allow users to switch between landscape and portrait-oriented photos and video. Photos can be captured in both Raw and JPEG formats, while with video, you can capture in both standard and flat color profiles, and if you're shooting slow motion, you can shoot up to 4K. Overall, we think this is an excellent drone for users who don't quite want to pay top prices but want a seriously compact piece of equipment with pro-spec features. Under 250g with a 12/48MP camera Smart controller, omnidirectional obstacle avoidance and advanced subject tracking Shoots high-quality photos and videos in both portrait and landscape formats ✅ You're looking for excellent optics in a small package: This is the smallest and lightest of the drones that come with a one-inch sensor, so it strikes an ideal balance between image quality and portability. ✅ You're a videographer in need of top-quality video: The video resolution on this drone reaches an impressive 5.4K and it can also film in 4K at 60fps, leaving plenty of room for cropping and editing in post-production. ❌ You need an adjustable aperture: The aperture on this drone's camera is fixed at f/2.8 so you'd need to use ND filters to control shutter speed when filming video. 🔎 DJI Air 2S The main selling point of this drone is that it offers portability whilst not compromising on excellent image quality with its one-inch sensor. That makes it ideal for keen photographers and videographers who like to carry a drone with them on days out, but the fixed aperture may be a deal-breaker for some. ★★★★½ The DJI Air 2S has well and been superseded by the Air 3 and Air 3S, but it's still available to buy from some retailers and should be available at a competitive price. It's a great drone overall despite its age and the 24mm equivalent camera with a 20MP 1-inch sensor produces great image quality with impressive high ISO performance. There's no adjustable aperture, this is fixed at f/2.8, but there is up to an 8x digital zoom available. But as we mentioned in our DJI Air 2S review, image quality does suffer with digital zooms so we recommend only going as far as 2x to maintain optimal image quality. This is a compact and lightweight drone: it weighs just 21oz (595g) and measures 7.1 x 3 x 3.3 inches (18 x 9.7 x 7.7cm) when it's folded up. It's not sub-250g, but it is still small and light enough to make it easy to carry around and pack into a bag. We're also very impressed with the build quality of the DJI Air 2S. It feels very sturdy and reliable which, given the price point of the Air 2S, is very welcome indeed. You can shoot up to an impressive 5.4K video and 4K video at 60fps, creating some stunning shots. The only downside is that it comes with a fixed f/2.8 aperture so you can't control the exposure while it's in flight and will need to use a set of ND filters for filming video. Like many of the other DJI drones, the Air 2S is packed with features that make flying it safe and easy. It's equipped with front, rear, bottom and top obstacle sensors, AirSense ADS-B technology to detect aircraft and multiple automated flight patterns that mean even beginners can shoot complex-looking video footage. We think it offers great value for money if you're looking for a portable drone that can still maintain high image quality and functionality. Light and compact with a one-inch sensor Advanced Pilot Assistance System and AirSense technology Sharp images with little fall-off and digital zoom ✅ You're looking for a more affordable beginner option: If your budget can't quite stretch to the DJI Mini 3 Pro, then the DJI Mini 3 is a great option and comes with the same high-quality camera on board. ❌ You want more advanced flying features: To save money, this drone doesn't come with obstacle avoidance or subject tracking, so you'll need to be very careful not to let it bump into things when flying it. 🔎 DJI Mini 3 With the same excellent camera on board, this is a great alternative to the DJI Mini 3 Pro for those on a tighter budget who want a more accessible beginner model. The only catches are that it doesn't come with obstacle avoidance or subject tracking and the 4K video tops out at 30fps. ★★★★ If the DJI Mini 4 Pro is out of your price range, the DJI Mini 3 is the next best option and even uses the same sensor. This means that image quality is almost identical, which is great news for pilots on a budget. The DJI Mini 3 isn't an entry-level DJI mini model, like the DJI Mini 4K, but it is the more basic option of the higher-end Mini models when compared to the DJI Mini 4 Pro. Video capture is more basic and the Mini 3 doesn't offer collision avoidance. That said, it's still an impressive drone for the price. The camera provides an equivalent focal length of 24mm, which is wide-angle and an ideal focal length for aerial photography and video. This is backed up by a 1/1.3-inch 12MP sensor and fixed f/1.7 aperture. The camera also rotates 90° to shoot photos and videos in both landscape and portrait formats, which is a most welcome feature for photographers and those creating aerial videos for social media. In our DJI Mini 3 review, we found the ISO handling to be excellent throughout the full range of ISO 100-3200. Photos can be captured in both Raw and JPEG formats. Video can be captured up to 4K at 30 fps in the Normal color profile. So, while not as good as the Pro 4, which can shoot in the flat D-Log M color profile for color grading and professional workflows, it's ideal for beginners and intermediate users. Excellent 12.1MP camera with 1/1.3-inch sensor More basic, with no collision avoidance or subject tracking Films in portrait or landscape, but only 30fps at 4K ✅ You want an easy FPV drone: With the incredibly intuitive Motion Controller, anyone can enjoy easy and immersive FPV flight. ✅ You would like to capture FPV video: FPV looks amazing because it provides the viewer with an almost bird’s eye perspective. ❌ You want to capture photos: While the Avata 2 can capture photos in JPEG format, it’s extremely limited in this capacity. A camera drone is much better for this. ❌ You don’t like FPV goggles: Not everyone gets on the FPV goggles and some people can suffer from motion sickness using them. 🔎 DJI Avata The DJI Avata 2 is DJI’s best FPV drone to date, with the ability to be used by beginners or expert FPV pilots to capture great quality and immersive 4K video. The Motion Controller 3 is a breeze to use and the DJI Goggles 3 provide a crystal clear FPV feed.★★★★½ FPV drones are traditionally difficult to fly, albeit the most exhilarating once you've gotten to grips with manual control. DJI has turned this tradition on its head with its FPV drones and the DJI Avata 2 is an FPV drone that can be flown competently by both absolute beginners and experienced FPV pilots looking for peak performance. For beginners, the DJI Motion 3 Controller is incredibly intuitive and makes FPV flight as easy as playing a computer game. All that's required is for the pilot to pull the trigger to fly forward while tilting the controller forward or backward to ascend and descend. Turning is achieved simply by tilting the controller to the left or right. Plus, GPS positioning holds the drone in a hover when the trigger is released. For more advanced pilots, the drone can be flown in Acro mode using the DJI FPV Remote Controller 3 but this is for experts because, as we found out in our DJI Avata 2 review, the drone can be crashed extremely easily. Whether you're a beginner or an expert pilot, you'll enjoy the new DJI Goggles 3 which provides a clear and crisp 1080p 60fps feed of the FPV camera using DJI 04 Video Transmission. The FPV camera of the Avata 2 can capture 4K 60fps video, and if you're happy to reduce the resolution of 1080p, you can get frame rates of up to 120fps. Different color profiles are available, including Normal for straight-out-of-camera footage and D-Log M flat profile if you want more advanced post-processing options and color grading. We've found the video quality to be fantastic here and there's no reason you can't use the camera here to capture video alone — but some FPV pilots prefer to attach action cameras to the drone instead. Easy to fly with beginner-friendly Motion Controller Great video feed via DJI Goggles 3 Excellent video quality with immersive results ✅ You need two focal lengths: With cameras offering 24mm and 70mm equivalent focal lengths, this versatile drone can be used to capture a range of subjects. ✅ You need a balanced drone: The Air 3 sits between the Mini 4 Pro and the Mavic 3 Pro, offering similar features and functionality but is lighter than the Mavic with more powerful than the Mini. ❌ You need an adjustable aperture: This drone has two cameras with fixed apertures, so if you'd prefer a model with an adjustable aperture for video, take a look at the Mavic 3 Classic and Mavic 3 Pro. ❌ You need a small and lightweight drone: If you'd prefer an easy-to-carry sub-250g drone with similar features to the Air 3, take a look at the DJI Mini 4 Pro. 🔎 The DJI Air 3 is an impressive drone overall and one that can suit the needs of both beginners and professionals. It's a feature-packed model with advanced functionality including omnidirectional obstacle avoidance and excellent image quality from the dual cameras. ★★★★1/2 With a power to weight ratio that makes flying in stronger wind than sub-250 g drones, the DJI Air 3 is an impressive performer pilots will undoubtedly enjoy. This drone features two cameras with focal lengths equivalent to 24mm and 70mm. Each of these is backed up by the same sensor found in the impressive DJI Mini 3 and Mini 4 Pro. You can shoot vertically using in-camera digital cropping, capture photos at 48MP, shoot slow-motion video at 4K and capture video in standard and flat color profiles. That's an impressive suite of features, and users will appreciate the flexibility of the focal lengths on offer to provide creative flexibility in a wide range of aerial situations. The Air 3 is a medium-sized model that sits between the DJI Mini 4 Pro and the DJI Mavic 3 Pro, with all three offering similar flight features. It's larger and more powerful than the former, with a maximum wind resistance of 27mph, and is slightly smaller and lighter than the latter, with a weight of 25.4oz / 720g. The advantage of medium-sized drones like this is that they're more powerful than sub-250 g models and also have a higher wind resistance. This opens up creative possibilities on more conditions, but this does mean that it's not as regulator-friendly. The batteries are also of higher capacity, which means longer flight times. Alongside precise GPS positioning, the Air 3 offers omnidirectional collision avoidance and advanced return to home, which in our DJI Air 3 review, we found incredibly useful. This is on top of incredibly easy-to-use flight controls, stable flight performance, advanced subject tracking functionality and to top it all off, excellent image quality for both photos and videos from both of the cameras. Mid-sized drone with a folding design Impressive object tracking and omnidirectional obstacle avoidance Excellent dual 24mm and 70mm cameras. ✅ You’re on a budget: With most of the features you could need as a beginner, the DJI Mini 4K comes in at a fantastic price making it the most affordable DJI drone available. ✅ You only need a basic drone: The Mini 4K has all the features you need to capture aerial photos and videos, so if you don’t need all the bells and whistles it's an obvious choice. ❌ You want a better camera: The Mini 4K camera produces great image quality, but the DJI Mini 3, DJI Air 3 and the DJI Mavic 3 Pro are leagues ahead in this department. ❌ You would like more features: This is a basic model that can shoot 4K video and photos in JPEG and RAW, but more expensive models naturally offer a wider variety of features. 🔎 The DJI Mini 4K is a fantastic drone for the price, making it a great budget option. Its flight performance can't be faulted and image quality for photos and videos is impressive given the small sensor size. ★★★★★ Nipping at the heels of, and in many cases overtaking, all inexpensive beginner drones, the DJI Mini 4K is a beginner pilot's dream. This is DJI's most inexpensive sub-250 g drone and is capable of capturing great quality video in 4K up to 30 FPS, 2.7K up to 30 FPS and 1080p up to 60 FPS. Photo capture is also available in both JPEG and RAW formats. This palm-sized drone weighs just 8.7 oz / 249 g, which means that US pilots won’t have to register with the FAA or use Remote ID if using the drone for recreational purposes. UK pilots will, however, still have to register as operators with the CAA. Take a look at our full review of the DJI Mini 4K to learn more about this impressive entry-level model. Despite its small size and light weight, the Mini 4K offers Level 5 wind resistance which equates to up to 24 mph, and is impressive for an entry-level drone. Flight times typically average around 21 minutes before Return to Home is initiated when the battery reaches 20%. It's far from the best flight time, so we recommend investing in the Fly More Bundle, which includes three batteries. Unsurprisingl,y given the size of the DJI Mini 4K, the image sensor on board is pretty small; it's a 12MP 1/2.3-inch CMOS sensor, but despite its small size size we found the image quality to be impressive and perfectly acceptable for beginners. 12MP isn't huge in terms of resolution but it's still enough to be able to print photos to around A3 if you wish. Video isn't affected by the resolution since 4K is only around 8MP and uses less of the sensor for the 16:9 ratio. What's more, photos can be enlarged in Adobe Lightroom the Super Resolution feature to increase file sizes by 4x. There are several noteworthy camera features here, including automatic exposure bracketing and a built-in panorama function, which photography enthusiasts will no doubt appreciate. There are also automated flight patterns - Quickshots - which will allow you to capture professional-looking videos at the touch of a button: the perfect tool for a beginner. A small and lightweight sub-250 g model with a folding design. features are basic but there are enough for beginners. Image quality is great considering the small sensor. ✅ You would like to learn how to fly FPV freestyle: This kit is designed specifically for beginners and for performing aerial stunts such as rolls, flips and dives. ✅ You want a digital FPV drone: Most traditional FPV drone kits use an analogue VTX (FPV feed), but the Tinyhawk III Plus Freestyle uses the digital HDZero system. ❌ You would like hover functionality: If you'd like camera drone functionality such as hovering and Return to Home, the Avata 2 is an FPV drone that can do both. ❌ You need 4K video capture: This drone only captures unstabilized 720p goggle footage and is too small to carry an action camera, so if you need 4K video consider the DJI Avata 2. 🔎 The Emax Tinyhawk III Plus Freestyle RTF Kit is fun to fly, offering beginners a progressive approach to FPV flight. It's tough and is highly capable considering its small size. ★★★★★ The Emax Tinyhawk III Plus Freestyle Kit is arguably the best traditional ready-to-fly (RTF) drone kit for FPV beginners. It's even a great little kit for more experienced pilots looking for some quick and easy FPV fun. What makes it ideal for beginners is that not only is it extremely tough, but it's tuned for freestyle flying with variable power options available. Take a look at our full Emax Tinyhawk III Plus Freestyle Kit review where we gave this impressive drone a top rating. The kit includes everything you need to get started, so out of the box, you're ready to fly once everything is charged. Plus, the digital FPV feed provides a clear and higher-resolution goggle feed. Being a freestyle FPV drone, the Tinyhawk III Plus sports a lightweight X-shaped airframe with exposed propellers and electronics that are exposed on the sides. The HDZero camera sits slightly recessed at the front of the drone, while the single 1S or two 1S batteries are attached to the top with a Velcro strap. The goggles included here, the Transporter 2 HD FPV goggles, are capable of displaying a 1080p on-screen image and can capture 720p 60 FPS video. If video is your main focus, you'll likely want to find something capable of capturing at a higher resolution, but for beginners, it's a good place to start. It's easy to capture too, with the goggles having a built-in DVR that can take a microSD card up to 64GB. X-shaped freestyle FPV design in miniature. Standard basic FPV drone, but the camera is digital. A huge amount of fun with a clear and crisp FPV feed to the goggles. ✅ You want the full immersive FPV experience: This drone comes with the DJI Goggles V2, allowing pilots to fully immerse themselves in the drone's perspective. Just make sure you have someone else on hand to act as a spotter to avoid any mishaps. ✅ You want a drone you can learn and develop your skills with: The various flight modes available on this drone mean that it caters to relative beginners as well as more experienced pilots, so you won't need to upgrade once you become more skilled. ❌ You want something that's easy to transport: This drone doesn't feature the convenient folding design that you get with the DJI Mavic range, so you'll need quite a big bag to carry it and will also need to remove the propellers to stop them getting damaged in transit. ❌ You're serious about aerial photography: More seasoned photographers may find this drone a bit limiting, since it only shoots in JPEG and there is no option to shoot in Raw. It also lacks the quality and automated shooting modes common to the Mavic drones. 🔎 DJI FPV This drone offers the full FPV immersive experience and has enough flexible features to cater to a range of different skill levels, making it great fun for anyone to fly. Those whose main focus is photography and image quality may be better off with the DJI Mavic range, but the DJI FPV is ideal for hobbyists who want to experience the thrill of flying an FPV drone. ★★★★ The DJI FPV may be a little long in the tooth, but it's still available to buy and is an incredibly fast FPV drone. And while it's certainly not ideal for capturing photos, it can capture awesome 4K videos at up to 60 FPS. The camera itself houses a 12MP 1/2.3-inch COMS sensor, while the lens provides a wide-angle equivalent focal length of 14.66mm. When paired with the DJI Goggles VI, the DJI FPV is about as close as you'll ever get to feeling like you're flying while keeping your feet firmly on the ground. It helps that the view within the goggles is beautifully crisp and sharp thanks to its high-quality screens. The motion controller is great to use, too: it sits comfortably in your hands and is intuitive and responsive. This drone is much larger than the newer DJI Avata 2 at 10 x 12.3 x 5 inches. This means it's much less transportable so you'll need a large case to carry it. But with this larger size comes greater power, and this drone is incredibly fast in its three flight modes with Manual mode being the fastest of all. Sport mode remains exhilarating and can be used with the Motion Controller, unlike Manual mode. Following our DJI FPV review, if you're a beginner the DJI Motion Controller is your best option for this drone. However, the DJI Avata 2 would be much more suitable overall if you're interested in getting started in FPV. The DJI FPV is, however, much less expensive so it may be a great option if you're on a tight budget. Non-foldable but comes with DJI Goggles V2 Range of different flight modes to suit all levels Great videos but not the best for still images ✅ You want to test out drone flying for the first time: This drone is a nice inexpensive way to try out the world of drones without worrying about crashing a seriously expensive bit of kit on your first flight. ✅ You want a fun present for kids: We think this drone would make a fun gift for any adventurous kids in your life, especially as it's safe to fly it indoors as well as in the backyard. ❌ You're looking for high image quality: In line with the price, the DJI Ryze Tello only offers 5MP still images and 720p video, so it's more suited to people who want to have fun flying than to people who want to capture brilliant shots. ❌ You want to do extended flying sessions: The battery life on this drone means that you can only get around 11-13 minutes of flying time. 🔎 DJI Ryze Tello As the cheapest drone on our list, this is ideal for anyone who wants to try out drone flying for the first time and would make a great gift for kids as well. It lacks the image quality of more expensive drones and the battery life is quite short, but it's a lot of fun and a good way to learn some initial flying skills. ★★★★ The DJI Ryze Tello is a great choice not only for those dipping their toes into drone piloting but also cfor hildren. While there are plenty of drones out there for professionals, following our DJI Ryzel Tello review we would consider it an ideal inexpensive first drone for beginners and children. The Ryze Tello certainly isn't going to win you any awards in the photography and video department with its 5MP camera and 720p video capture. That said, it's still a great drone for learning how to combine flight with image capture. There's no gimbal with the camera mounted directly to the front of the drone. There are, of course, other downsides, given the price point of the Tello (which comes in around $100). You'll only get around 13 minutes of flight time here, but it's fun to fly and a great introduction into the world of drones for beginners. You can control the drone from the smartphone app it can be paired with. Not to mention, it can be programmed using Scratch making it a suitable choice for kids. The DJI Telly Ryze can take off from the palm of your hand and be flipped in mid-air. You can even fly it indoors thanks to the propeller guards and the fact it weighs just 80 grams. It's worth noting that the flight distance on this drone is limited to 100m, however, and power is limited so only fly outdoors on windless days. The drone is easy to use and fun for children especially, and the phone app works well for control. Compatible physical controllers can also be purchased separately from Amazon if you'd prefer a more traditional flying experience but, either way, it remains a fun drone and is incredibly easy to use. Sleek, lightweight and affordable, with propeller guards Easy to fly with fun trick flight features Responsive controls and basic camera functions This year, Black Friday is on November 28 and the annual sales event will run through the weekend and into Cyber Monday, on December 1. We think the DJI Mavic 4 Pro is the best drone overall. It features excellent cameras and quality for shooting both stills and videos. It's packed full of useful features, is a direct upgrade on the Mavic 3 Pro (which is still very good) and overall, is a cut above anything else on the market. the DJI Mini 3 is the best for beginners. It all depends on what you want to achieve from your drone flight. If you're flying for the love of flying, anytime during daytime for maximum visibility and when there is as little wind as possible. But, if you're looking to shoot footage, daytime will give you maximum visibility or blue hour for nighttime shooting. That means about half an hour before sunrise or after sunset, when there's a blue glow to the night sky, which gives you more visibility in nighttime conditions. If you choose to fly at night, you must attach a suitable light to your drone for collision avoidance. It's crucial that you abide by the rules and regulations set by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). If your drone weighs more than 250g, you'll have to register it with the FAA. You can also fly your drone up to 400ft in the air, providing you maintain a clear line of sight with it. If your drone is within 400ft of a structure, then you can fly it up to 400ft above that structure. And, if you're using FPV goggles, you must have a spotter to maintain visuals on your drone. Yes. Most of the same rules and regulations apply as flying during the day but you must also attach an anti-collision light to your drone which must be visible for a minimum of three miles. Capturing footage is possible with most quality drones and we recommend blue hour as the best time to do this which is from half an hour before the sun goes down to half an hour after, where there's enough light for natural visibility but it's still dark outside. Buying a drone is exciting but can also be an overwhelming experience, considering the myriad options on the market. While there are hundreds of models to choose from, the advances in drone technology mean you're unlikely to find a really bad quality drone. However, they're usually a considerable investment, so it's worth thinking about what you're looking for in a drone to find the perfect fit for you. DJI is the market leader in drone technology. Their models also tend to be relatively good value considering their quality and the features they come with. DJI has an extensive lineup, with models for all budgets and abilities. Among other famous brands, you might want to consider Autel, Parrot and Skydio, all of which have quality products and unique features. Remember that if you're buying a drone weighing more than 249g, you'll need to register as a pilot with the CAA (UK) and FAA (US). The process is quick, easy, and relatively inexpensive, and failure to do so could result in a considerable fine. Space.com reviews a wide range of products, from telescopes, drones, and cameras to 3D printers and VR headsets. Consequently, our reviews have varying formats depending on the type of product being tested. No matter what we’re covering, though, there are three core areas that we look to test when writing our reviews: design, functionality and performance. The best drones typically offer a combination of features, functionality and photo and video quality. Testing takes place over several days in different locations, environments and weather conditions (excluding rain) to assess flight performance, flight features, overall handling and image quality for both photo and video capture. Drones are flown using manual flight patterns to test the connection between the aircraft and the controller, latency between the two, the accuracy of the controls, app connection, reliability and the flight experience in general. Automated flight patterns and collision avoidance are also typically available with these models, so these are always tested to check accuracy, reliability and ease of use. All testing is conducted in a way that meets local aviation laws and restrictions to ensure that all flights are safe and legal. Drone laws vary from region to region, so you must check local laws and make sure that you're following the guidelines for your country before embarking on your first drone flights.

    "content": "Whether you're stargazing or nature watching, you shouldn't underestimate the power and portability of a good pair of binoculars. To help you choose the right pair, we have rounded up the best binoculars. It's Black Friday at the end of November and lots of these models will be discounted, with some being pushed to their cheapest price yet. If you are in the market for a pair of new binoculars, then do your research now before savings go live on Nov. 28. The finest stargazing binoculars money can buy with in-built stabilization. As close to perfection as you’ll get for handheld astronomy. Some of the best optics on the market in an easily transportable roof prism design. A premium product at a premium price. They offer bright and clear views, with a wide aperture for gathering light and magnification that is excellent for stargazing and wildlife spotting. The TrailSeeker 8x42’s minimalist design makes them a hugely more attractive option than large and heavy deep-sky astronomy-centric binoculars. Best thought of as a great value pair of entry-level binoculars for all-round use and for occasional night sky views. These binoculars give a superb stargazing experience at a reasonable price. Fantastic magnification for lunar viewing. The pair you need if a wide field of view and a good sturdy build quality top your brief. Surprisingly good optics make these attractive to adults and kids alike. Considering what and who they're for, for the price, they're hard to beat. See the universe close up and in stereo, but don’t plan to hike with them as they're big and heavy. Ideal for anyone just starting out in stargazing. A sleek and well made binocular model with optics to boot. Slender and lightweight, these are ideal for beginners and hobbyists who need a 'go-anywhere' binocular. With high magnification and excellent light-gathering abilities, these binoculars are built to last. These combine the best of both worlds. They're excellent for daytime use but could equally be used for night-time stargazing. Some of the best small compact binoculars we've tested, with great image stabilization that brings them comparably close to other, larger binoculars. Why you can trust Space.com Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test and review products. ✅ You want the best of the best: Other than price and size, we really couldn't find major fault with these binoculars — we gave them 5 stars in our review. ❌ You're a casual user: These are an expensive pair of powerful binos, so if you're a casual sky-watcher or wildlife spotting, they'll be overkill. ❌ You want a lightweight binocular: These are undeniably heavy and bulky, so if weight is important to you, we'd suggest looking elsewhere. 🔎 Canon 10x42L IS WP binoculars: They're not perfect, but they’re as close as you’ll get for hand-held astronomy. They're an outstanding choice for super-steady stargazing thanks to their image stabilization, waterproof design and large objective lenses. ★★★★★ For hand-held astronomy, the Canon 10x42L IS WP binoculars are among the best you can get. Their standout feature is Canon's Optical Image Stabilization (IS). This clever technology uses gyroscope motion sensors to detect arm movements and a vari-angle prism to correct them by up to 0.8 degrees. With the push of a button, you can eliminate the movements caused by your hands shaking and get a steady image. This comes in particularly handy during long viewing sessions when your arms might get tired. The Canon 10x42L IS WP use premium L-series glass with Canon's multi-layered anti-reflective lens coating (known as 'Super Spectra') to increase light transmission and reduce lens flare. This ensures a bright and clear view with accurate color reproduction. During our Canon 10x42L IS WP binoculars review, we were really impressed with the incredibly sharp image which featured no chromatic aberration, which is just what you need for observing stars. The main downside to the Canon 10x42L IS WP binoculars is that they are, unfortunately, rather power hungry — but that's the same with any binos with high-tech features. Here, it's the IS system that requires so much power: We got through several AAA batteries in just one sky-watching session, so you'll need to bear that in mind if you're considering purchasing these and make sure you're well stocked-up on batteries every time you venture out. It's extra weight and bulk to carry around with you, and something else to think about when you're packing up your gear. We'd say that overall the Image Stabilization is worth it, though. We also weren't wholly satisfied with the accessories provided with these binoculars, especially considering the price point. We struggled to get the one-piece lens caps to stay in place, and the carry case was a bit basic and flimsy, so you might want to upgrade it. But overall, these are still the best stargazing binoculars on our list thanks to the astronomy-centric glass and clever image stabilization feature. Rugged build quality, but bulky. Produce bright and colorful images. ✅ You want some of the best on the market: If you're prepared to pay for them, these binoculars have a premium finish and deliver stunning optical performance. They'll last you for years to come. ❌ You specifically want image stabilization: This may be the only thing missing from this pair of binos, so if that's important to you, there previous option in this guide might be better for you. 🔎 Nikon Monarch HG 10x42: A premium package with a premium price, these binoculars are not ideal for beginner users unless you have deep pockets or a real passion for wildlife- or sky-watching that you plan on pursuing for years to come. ★★★★½ Optics don't get much better than those on the Nikon Monarch HG 10x42 binoculars. But it's no surprise, when these binos come from Nikon, a brand synonymous with cameras and high-quality optical equipment. The Monarch HGs use a Field Flattener Lens System, which ensures that images are sharp all the way across the field of view and not just at one specific point. Coupled with their Extra-low Dispersion glass, which practically eliminates chromatic aberration, these binoculars are very hard to beat indeed. During our Nikon Monarch HG 10x42 review we tested these binoculars in a range of challenging conditions and were pleased with the results every single time. Light transmission is good because the 42mm objective lenses are large enough to allow light to pass through even in twilight hours. Every single glass element also contains multilayer coatings to help improve the transmission of light, which Nikon reported as being 92% or higher. Whilst they're undeniably pricey binoculars, we feel you're getting real quality for your money with this pair. Everything about them feels premium. The magnesium alloy body is slim and lightweight enough to slip into a coat pocket, but they feel balanced in the hand and come coated in a grippy rubberized armor. They're also entirely waterproof, so you don't need to worry about getting caught out in bad weather, and they're nitrogen-filled to prevent fogging as well. Even the accessories feel high-quality. These binoculars come with a cushioned neck strap, objective lens caps and a premium carry case that has a secure safety catch to prevent them from falling out during transit (no relying on velcro here). We also enjoyed other unexpected details like the locking mechanism on the diopter adjustment ring which means it can't get accidentally knocked out of place. The only thing they lack is image stabilization technology. Razor sharp views from edge to edge. Only way to improve would be inclusion of image stabilization. ✅ You want to take them anywhere in any weather: They were created with the outdoor enthusiast in mind, and they're waterproof and fogproof so you can use them anywhere. ❌ You want to use them for prolonged periods: They may become quite heavy if you plan on using them for long periods. 🔎 Celestron Nature DX 12x56: They offer bright and clear views, with a wide aperture for gathering light and excellent magnification for stargazing and wildlife spotting. ★★★★½ The Celestron Nature DX 12x56 binoculars are a great deal for under $250, perfect for casual wildlife spotting, bird watching or stargazing. The build quality is fantastic: They have a full rubber housing and they're completely waterproof, fogproof and nitrogen-purged. The Nature DX 12x56 binoculars include a tripod mount that could be useful for longer viewing sessions and a rain guard that protects the lenses from getting watermarked. The focus knobs turn smoothly and easily. During our Celestron Nature DX 12x56 review, we appreciated that the binoculars can focus on objects less than 10 feet away, making them great for spotting wildlife in your backyard. If you wear glasses, you'll appreciate the 16mm eye relief provided by the twist-up eyecups. Despite coming in at under $250, we think the optics on the Celestron Nature DX 12x56 binoculars are comparable to some more expensive models. That's because they have multi-coated optics and BaK-4 prisms, which are generally regarded as being the best. The Nature DX are only let down by their lack of sharpness, which may be disappointing for more advanced or professional users, but if you're a casual user we think these binos are amongst the best you can buy. If you want a high-quality pair of binoculars for bird watching or wildlife watching and can forgo some level of sharpness that more expensive models can provide, these are attractive. They are also suitable for sky watching and, thanks to the rubber armoring, are hardy enough to be taken anywhere without worrying about the elements. Bright images even when observing in low light. A little heavy for prolonged use. ✅ You want to travel with them: We found these binos were lightweight enough to travel with them easily, although perhaps not the best for prolonged periods of handheld use. ❌ You're serious about astro: These binos lack the magnification needed for dedicated astro use, particularly for observing deep sky objects. 🔎 Celestron TrailSeeker 8x42 binoculars: Traveling stargazers will love them as they work well after dark and strike a balance between quality, affordability and portability. The TrailSeeker 8x42’s minimalist design makes them a more attractive option than large and heavy deep-sky astronomy-centric binoculars ★★★★½ We think the Celestron TrailSeeker 8x42 binoculars make a great pair for amateur astronomy, whilst also having the flexibility to be used for a range of other pursuits. Their price point sits just above the more affordable mass-market binoculars, and this means that you get high-quality BaK-4 glass and multi-coated optics, as well as waterproofing and nitrogen purging to make these binoculars safe to use in any weather conditions. In our Celestron TrailSeeker 8x42 binoculars review we were very pleased with the build quality on these binoculars. They're constructed from a lightweight magnesium frame with rubber coating for grip and protection. They also come with a useful range of accessories, including a thick and comfortable neck strap, a padded carry case and an innovative harness strap that spreads the weight of the binoculars over your shoulders for longer viewing sessions. If you're looking for good binoculars for stargazing, the Celestron TrailSeeker binoculars — despite coming from Celestron — might not be the best choice on the market thanks to their 8x magnification and 42mm lens diameter. Ultimately, they're at the lowest useful end, so while they're not completely useless, you won't be able to enjoy any views of deep space. We have found them capable of offering adequate views of star clusters and the Milky Way, however, thanks to their wide viewing angle. It's also worth noting that the TrailSeeker 8x42 binoculars don't have Extra-low Dispersion (ED) glass, so we experienced a fair bit of color fringing, particularly when viewing bright objects such as the moon. It's not a surprise at this price point, however — and Celestron do have a model with ED glass, but as you'd expect it's notably more expensive. Their specifications make them an entry-level choice in some ways; you wouldn’t want to go any lower than their 8x magnification and 42mm objective lens size. Although the TrailSeeker 8x42 are good all-rounders, 10x50 binoculars remain the sweet spot for stargazing. Glasses-wearers will also find this pair easy to use thanks to their generous 17mm eye relief, which can be set in three different positions depending on your preference. Good quality optics, slight color fringing. ✅ You're a beginner: If you've used binoculars before, then these are unlikely to impress you, but they're perfectly suited to beginners. ❌ You specialize in astro: While they do give decent views of the night sky, anyone focusing solely on astronomy would likely want to go for a more powerful pair. 🔎 Celestron UpClose G2 10x50 Binocular: A great value pair of binoculars, well suited for entry-level and all-round use. They're also great for occasional night sky use and are easy to set up, use and adjust. If you're an astronomer on a budget, these are a decent choice, although we do question their longevity. ★★★★½ These are affordable skywatching binoculars that would be ideal for anyone just starting out who wants to get the most for their money. In our Celestron UpClose G2 10x50 binocular review, we found the moon looks amazing through these binoculars, easily fitting into the view with just a hint of false color. In July 2020, the UpClose G2 10x50 binoculars were very effective in spotting the naked-eye comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE). We managed to spot three stars within the Trapezium Cluster near the center of the Orion Nebula (Messier 42), but you'd need a pair with higher magnification if you want to see the fourth bright star in this star-forming area. If you're on a budget, then, the UpClose G2 10x50 binoculars are a fantastic choice, particularly if you're just starting out on a stargazing hobby. They're light enough to carry around and if you're out trekking, they're ideal to throw in a backpack without adding too much extra bulk. They're not all perfect, though; of course some corners have been cut considering the price. We've discussed the pitfalls in more detail in our review, but you'll need to adjust the alignment of the lenses (collimation) for one. They aren't waterproof, either, and they haven't been nitrogen-purged, so we wouldn't recommend using them in inclement weather. While the rubber armor and aluminum housing is labeled as water-resistant, we certainly wouldn't like to push our luck with them. They're liable to fog up in the cold — although they were fine during a two-hour session in near-freezing conditions. Basic build design and quality. Surprisingly little chromatic aberration. Needs greater magnification for astro. ✅ You want good quality without breaking the bank: Given the high magnification, sturdy build and large objectives, we think these offer a lot for the price. ❌ You want to view planets or small distant galaxies: They don't excel in this area, they're more suited to providing dramatic wide-field views or larger objects. 🔎 Celestron SkyMaster Pro 15x70 Binoculars: These offer a top stargazing experience for a reasonable price. They won’t give you close-ups of planets or reveal the most distant galaxies, but they make up for it by providing dramatic wide-field views in a good, dark sky. ★★★★½ Celestron is a well-respected brand with a strong reputation and the SkyMaster binoculars, including the 15x70 'giant' model, deliver excellent views at an affordable price. Despite being a bit on the heavy side, these binoculars are durable and we think they offer impressive quality for their cost. The SkyMaster 15x70 binoculars' number one advantage is how much light they can gather. The 70mm objective lenses pull in a huge amount of light and, coupled with the 15x magnification, they're perfect for gazing at the stars with. Objects in the night sky are much clearer than they are with less powerful binoculars, although it's worth noting that there's some blurring around the edges of the lens — a common trait of cheaper models. They're a great choice if you wear glasses too, since the Celestron SkyMaster 15x70 binoculars have an impressive 0.7 inches (18mm) of eye relief, so you should be able to use them comfortably. Optically the star images were excellent at the center of the field of view, but the distortion was evident towards the edges, with the stars appearing as streaks. This is not very disturbing, as one’s vision is only sharp at the center anyway, but it means that you would have to move the binoculars to explore a large starfield. To get edge-to-edge sharpness in binoculars of this size you will have to pay a great deal more. At 11 inches (280mm) in length and weighing 3 lbs (1.36kg), we found in our Celestron SkyMaster Pro 15x70 binocular review that they certainly have a lot of heft. Using them handheld isn't impossible, but for maximum comfort, it's best to use a tripod with these binoculars. Their powerful magnification makes views of the moon truly stunning, and we were especially impressed by how the lunar surface looked three-dimensional. Despite the larger 70mm objective aperture, the higher magnification of 15x reduces the apparent field of view to 4.4 degrees, compared to typical 10x50s or 12x50s that provide a degree more. Excellent for viewing larger deep-sky objects. ✅ You want to travel with them: These binoculars' lightweight design makes them extremely manageable to travel with. ❌ You're on a tight budget: While they're not the most expensive option on this list, anyone on a tight budget could certainly find a more affordable pair. 🔎 Vortex 10x50 Crossfire HD Binocular: If you want to move up to the next level with your binocular stargazing, then the roof prisms on these binoculars bring super-sharp views and come with a useful harness and an excellent padded case. ★★★★ The Vortex 10x50 Crossfire HD binoculars have a lot going for them. We think they're reliable and sturdy, and useful whether you're watching wildlife or doing the occasional bit of astronomy. Their design is outstanding, particularly thanks to the focusing knob that's easy to adjust even if you're wearing very thick gloves. The eyecups, too, are a standout feature, thanks to being customizable and twistable. The eye relief goes to 17mm, which we think is very generous and useful if you wear glasses. The Crossfire HD binoculars are lightweight, too: they weigh only 1.89lbs (0.86kg) so you'll barely notice them in a backpack or in your luggage while you're traveling. The Vortex 10x50 Crossfire HD are roof prism binoculars, which means a relatively compact and space-saving design of two tubes joined by a small hinge in the center that houses the optics and the focusing knob. The lens caps on the 50mm objective lenses are tethered to the hinge. The Vortex Crossfire HD 10x50 binoculars provide a sharp and clear view, particularly if you're into astronomy; they make stars look like perfect pinpoints of light. You might notice some color distortion when looking at brighter objects, but this is common for binoculars in this price range. However, they offer a great balance of brightness and sharpness across the entire field of view. During our Vortex 10x50 Crossfire HD review, we only observed a tiny drop-off towards the very edges of the field of view. There are a few downsides to them, of course. Although these binoculars come with a harness, we realized during our testing that the padded case forms part of the harness so you can't use one without the other, which is a little frustrating. Sturdy, well constructed build. Excellent padded case and harness. ✅ You're buying for your kids: These make a great inexpensive, 'don't care if they get trashed' pair of binoculars that are great for kids who aren't particularly careful. ❌ You want good quality: They're decent for what they are, but if you want good quality optics we'd recommend spending a bit more on a better pair. 🔎 Celestron Cometron 7x50: Their small size and light weight (1 lb 11 oz) let you use them all day, yet you can still hand-hold them comfortably after sunset and long into your dark night of sky-watching. Considering what and who they're for, for the price, they're hard to beat. ★★★★ It is a known fact that children have better night vision than adults, meaning they do not require high-end binoculars to see the same amount of light that an adult would with a more powerful pair. As such, the 7x magnification and 50mm objective lenses make the Celestron Cometron 7x50 a great choice for kids (they're featured in our best binoculars for kids guide). Having reviewed the specs on paper, we weren't too excited about reviewing this pair of binoculars, but to our pleasant surprise, we ended up loving them in our Celestron Cometron 7x50 review. We think they offer a budget-friendly entry into the realm of sky-watching, and if they don't suit you, the gamble will only set you back $40. The Celestron Cometron 7x50 are lightweight and easy to carry around, even in the small hands of a child. They are, however, not so lightweight that they will break easy: they're hard-wearing enough that they can withstand the odd bash or knock. It's worth noting, though, that they aren't waterproof, so we wouldn't recommend using them in bad weather (and they certainly wouldn't survive being dropped in a puddle). Keep in mind that kids might find it more challenging to keep binoculars steady for a long time, so it's a good idea to pick a pair that are lightweight and comfortable for them. This makes it easier for kids to use them and helps prevent them from getting tired quickly. Alternatively, consider mounting them on a tripod. Water-resistant, not waterproof. Useful for other subjects in the daytime. Ideal for use by adults and kids alike. ✅ You want more detailed views: The high magnification means you can pick out some incredible details in the vast night sky. ❌ You want to use them handheld: They're big and heavy, so using them handheld would end in arm-ache and you'd have a hard job holding them steady. 🔎 Celestron SkyMaster 25x100 Binocular: These heavy-hitters are certainly not for uninitiated. We think these are more akin to two 100mm refractor telescopes stuck together as they have an enormous reach. They're our favorite large astronomy binoculars, and with proper care, they could give you decades of joyful stereoscopic star-hopping. ★★★★ The Celestron SkyMaster 25x100 are our top pick for large astronomy binoculars. They act like two 100mm (4-inch) refractor telescopes set up side-by-side, with built-in image-erecting prisms and eyepieces that rotate independently through 450 degrees rather than the combined central focus knob that you get on traditional binoculars. They also have a 15mm eye relief, which is just enough to comfortably use them with glasses. During our Celestron SkyMaster 25x100 review, we were impressed with the breathtaking images of the night sky they provided. We were able to pick out clusters of galaxies like the Leo Triplets, Jupiter's atmospheric belts and the Sagittarius star cloud (also known as Messier 24). The multi-coated optics produce bright, clear views through the unusually large objective lens diameters. It goes without saying that the Celestron SkyMaster 25x100 binoculars are very heavy and large. You won't be able to use them handheld, so they will need to be mounted to a tripod using the built-in tripod adapter. They're rather heavy, too, weighing in at 8.75lbs (3.97kg) which doesn't make them all that suitable for carrying around (particularly considering you'll also need to carry a tripod). But the size is, of course, for a reason, because without binoculars this large you can't get such breathtaking views of the night sky. The only real let-downs are the disappointing lens covers and the thin carry case, but aside from those, we think these binoculars are amongst the best for astronomy. Perfect for finding clusters of galaxies. 450 degree independent eyepiece rotation. ✅ You're looking for your 'first pair' of binoculars: We think they're a great option for anyone starting out in their astronomy journey. ❌ You wear glasses: The eye relief is only 0.46-inch/11.8mm, so they aren't great if you wear glasses. ❌ You need them for travel: We found them a little bulky, so they might not be the best pair to travel with. 🔎 Nikon 10x50 Aculon A211 Binoculars: Ideal for anyone just starting out in stargazing. They're a bit bulky for travel and they don't offer much eye relief, but they're bright and sharp enough for impressive entry-level astronomy. ★★★★ The Nikon 10x50 Aculon A211 are our top pick for entry-level astronomy. Their 10x magnification and 50mm objective lenses are ideal for stargazing, though they could also be used for observing birds or other wildlife when you're out and about. For the price, we think the optics on these are fantastic. They utilize a porro prism design, which makes them a bit bulkier than some other options, but really maximizes the brightness of the image for stargazing. They also incorporate high-density BaK-4 glass, which is much better than the BK-7 glass that you'll more commonly find at this price point. This makes them a great-value choice for those looking to get started with astronomy. We really enjoyed scanning the skies with these during our Nikon 10x50 Aculon A211 binoculars review. Stars appeared extremely sharp in the center of the field of view, with just some blurring towards the outer edges and a little chromatic aberration when viewing the moon. This is to be expected at this price point, but we don't think it would hinder the enjoyment of first-time stargazers. If you're considering buying the Nikon 10x50 Aculon A211 binoculars, there are a couple things worth keeping in mind. First, their close focus distance is a minimum of 23 feet (7 meters), which means if you want to observe wildlife at close range, perhaps in your own backyard, they're perhaps not the best choice. They also have a fairly small eye relief at 11.8mm, which isn't great if you wear glasses. Bright and sharp images, some chromatic aberration. ✅ You want quality on a budget: Nikon hasn't cut any corners here, and the optics are excellent for the low price point. ❌ You primarily use them for stargazing: While we did find they performed well for stargazing, they're not astro-specialists, so if that's your niche there are better options out there. 🔎 Nikon PROSTAFF P3 8x42: Slender and lightweight, these are ideal for beginners and hobbyists who need a 'go-anywhere' binocular, or for those who want a lighter binocular around their neck. ★★★★ If you're looking for a fantastic pair of entry level binoculars, look no further than the Nikon Prostaff P3 8x42. We think they are of a much higher quality than their modest price tag would imply, and they're a great buy for any beginner or casual user. The Prostaff P3 8x42 are fairly new to the market and they really stand out from the crowd due to their excellent optics — they really are a cut above the competition. Another stand-out feature is their impressive eye relief: at 20.2mm it's one of the largest on this list, making them perfect for anyone who wears glasses (or needs adjustable eyecups for comfort). These binoculars are designed to be lightweight and durable. Made from strong fiberglass-reinforced polycarbonate resin, they have a non-slip rubber coating for a comfortable grip during long use. The shockproof design makes them resistant to damage from any accidental drops or bumps, and they are also waterproof and fog-proof, which is impressive for their affordable price. During our Nikon Prostaff P3 8x42 binocular review, we found adjusting the focus on very easy, and we love that they offer just the right amount of resistance, even when you're wearing thick gloves. Although they don't include a tripod adaptor, their 8x magnification and lightweight design (only 572g) make them manageable without one. The Nikon Prostaff P3 8x42 are great for casual nature watching or travel, without stressing about exceeding your luggage weight limit. However, if you plan on long nights of extended stargazing, they might not be the most suitable choice. Solid polycarbonate fiberglass-reinforced body. ✅ You want a long-term pair: If you're looking for a reliable pair of binoculars with high magnification that will last you for years to come, these are a great choice. ❌ You want something lightweight: They're quite heavy and require a tripod in order to hold them steady, so they're not ideal for prolonged handheld use. 🔎 Nikon Action EX 12x50 Binoculars: A step-up from mass market models with a little extra magnification, excellent light-gathering and rugged construction including waterproofing, comfy rubber grips and a large focus knob. ★★★★ The Nikon Action EX 12x50 binoculars are a fantastic option compared to more mainstream 10x50 binoculars as they provide a higher 12x magnification while maintaining the same 50mm aperture. The build is excellent, featuring comfortable rubber grips and a large focus knob, although the 13mm eye relief will be a little short for anyone who wears glasses. You'll generally find that when using higher magnification binoculars, you'll get slightly duller images. That's because you're magnifying the same amount of collected light. But with the Nikon Action EX 12x50 binoculars, that's not really the case: Thanks to their multi-coated lenses and high-refractive-index prisms, their images remain beautifully bright, which is a serious plus for anyone considering binoculars with a more powerful magnification. The Nikon Action EX 12x50, weighing in at 2.3 lbs (1.04kg), is too heavy for long bouts of stargazing, and the higher magnification will enhance any image wobble, so we advise using a tripod. In our Nikon Action EX 12x50 binoculars review, we found that these binoculars give clear and sharp images in the center, especially when looking at stars. However, you might see some distortion near the edges of the 5.5-degree field of view. Seeing Saturn's rings individually wasn't possible with this pair of binoculars, but observers can still notice clear ansae – the extensions of the rings on either side of the planet, creating an oblate shape. Overall, they offer a great viewing experience. Excellent light gathering & sharp optics. ✅ You want versatile binoculars: We found these binoculars great for daytime use and nighttime stargazing, giving you the best of both worlds. ❌ You wear glasses: There's only 0.-56-inch/14.3mm of eye-relief, so they're not ideal if you wear glasses. 🔎 Celestron Nature DX ED 12x50 Binoculars: One of the best binoculars for stargazing, wildlife observations and more. The key to their flexibility is their use of high-end extra-low dispersion (ED) objective lenses to create sharp, bright, and aberration-free images within a compact and portable design. ★★★★ These are some of the finest handheld binoculars for stargazing and wildlife observation. The Extra-low Dispersion (ED) objective lenses produce aberration-free sharp images. During our Celestron Nature DX ED 12x50 review, we took them to several events, which made us appreciate how lightweight and compact they are to carry in their padded case. We tested them at a motor race and were delighted with the bright and sharp views, even at dusk. We were equally happy with how well these binoculars worked at night. The Pleiades star cluster looked sharp and clear across the entire view, with only a slight decrease in quality towards the edges, and we didn't see any noticeable color distortion either. This is an excellent pair of binoculars that boasts great quality for a relatively low price. You can typically pick them up for under $250, which is more expensive than some pairs on this list, but they're well worth the price. We particularly love the tough rubber armor on the outer casing of the binoculars, protecting them from water damage and the odd impact. However, we've been let down by the quality of the Celestron Nature DX ED 12x50's eyecups. They're not very comfortable to use, and in particular if you wear glasses you'll likely find them a problem. It's not serious enough to ruin the binoculars entirely but it's something to keep in mind. Extra-Low Dispersion (ED) glass. ✅ You want compact binoculars: These are truly tiny and offer fantastic image stabilization which enhances the optics tenfold. ❌ You need waterproof binoculars: While they worked ok in light rain, these binoculars aren't waterproof and so may not handle heavier rain as well. 🔎 Nikon Stabilized 12x25 S binoculars: Incredibly compact and easily pocketable, these binoculars are ideal for carrying around as well as offering fantastic IS, enhancing the optics and skywatching experience — you won't want anything else ★★★★★ In our full Nikon Stabilized 12x25 S binoculars review, we called them out as one of the \"best small binoculars I’ve ever tested and I highly recommend them for stargazing.\" Their compact design makes them easy to pop in your pocket and carry with you wherever you go, while the IS enhances your skywatching experience. The IS is easy to engage, with a button located on the top of the binoculars. Its auto shut-off is rather delayed compared to other brands we've tested, turning off after 60 minutes but Nikon argue this is to save energy. This makes sense when the IS is powered by two AA batteries, although rechargeables can be used. We tested the IS on land and on water and throughout various times of the day — we felt the IS was very good. In terms of skywatching, we managed to see common constellations in much more detail, plus we manage to spot M31 (Andromeda galaxy) and M42 (Orion nebula). Unfortunately, any smaller or fainter objects were not observed in light polluted areas. The views you get through these binoculars are sharp in the center, however, they are a little softer on the edges. We also found the views to be darker than what you'd see with the naked eye. Nevertheless, for their size and the ability to use IS, we think they're a truly great pair of compact binoculars with none of the 'flaws' we spotted to be anything other than expected for such a compact pair of binoculars.

The Porro-prism kind have the most common look of any binocular. They feature a gradual and stepped-up appearance, forming part of the housing which includes two exit pupils, eyecups, central focuser, objective lenses and optical system. You’ll find them best for observing due to their affordability. Meanwhile, the Roof-prism binocular boasts a “H”-shaped appearance that lends well to a smaller, and lighter-weight design. These instruments have complicated optical designs, which means that observers need to spend a substantial amount of money to own a reliable binocular of this type. As such, a good Roof-prism binocular isn’t ideal for those on a budget, or casual observers. Examine any binoculars and you’ll discover that one of several combinations of numbers separated by a 'x' will be visible — for example, 7x40, 10x50, 8x40 and so on. These numbers, which are often located close to the eyepieces, tell you the magnification and aperture of the optical system. For example a 10x50 binocular has a magnification, or 'power' of 10x and front lenses with a diameter of 50mm. These numbers determine which objects you can observe by telling you how much you can magnify them by and how much light your binoculars can collect. The larger the aperture, the easier it will be to see fainter night sky targets such as galaxies and nebulae. As a rule of thumb, and under decent observing conditions, 7x35 binoculars will reveal a hundred thousand stars while 10x50s will show the finer details of the moon, planets, the Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31) and the Orion Nebula. Larger, heavier binoculars such as 20x80s and 20x100s open up a wealth of objects such as the fainter spiral galaxies Messier 65 and NGC 3628 and a selection of globular clusters and star-forming regions. Some models of binocular have their field of view printed on the barrels or somewhere close to the magnification and aperture. Given in degrees, this number tells you how wide you can see when peering through the eyepieces. The larger the number, the wider the scene. Ten degrees will allow the Big Dipper’s bowl to comfortably fit within your field of view. As you shop around for your next piece of observing kit, you’ll come across the terms BaK-4, BK-7 and K9. These refer to the formulations of glass found in the prisms of spotting scopes, binoculars and monoculars. BK-7 and K9 glass refer to borosilicate formulations and can be found in cheaper products. While they're used across a wide range of brands, this glass is said to lead to problematic exit pupils; the field of view in particular isn’t perfectly round, which can leave the observer with poor clarity around the edges of their chosen target. We must stress that this isn’t true of all pieces of kit, so we advise giving your chosen binoculars a test before committing to them. While it's a touch more expensive than BK-7 and K9, the BaK-4 — or barium crown glass — is preferable for binoculars. With this type of prism you’ll achieve a higher quality of image, particularly when combined with a well-made optical system. Without coatings on the optics of binoculars, images would be blurry and lack contrast since light transmission would be poor, glare would become prevalent and light would be lost through internal reflections. The observer would be left with a disappointing view. It’s easy to find out if your binocular lenses feature a coating: you’ll see a darker appearance when you peer through the barrels, while the glass will feature a bluish or greenish tint thanks to a layer of magnesium fluoride. If you see a brownish tint, then your optics are coated with calcium fluoride. Both offer the same outcome — they halt the reflection of some wavelengths, allowing more light to enter your eyes through the exit pupils. Binoculars largely come in two varieties when it comes to coatings: they’re either fully coated or multi-coated. In both versions, all lenses, glass surfaces and prisms feature at least one layer of magnesium fluoride or calcium fluoride. Binoculars with multi-coated optics are the most superior kind you’ll be able to find on the market, with at least one of the surfaces featuring several layers of anti-reflective compounds. For a decent observing experience in the dark, the best binoculars for stargazing must have an optical system that is able to collect as much light as possible to pick out those faint targets. In other words, the larger the aperture, the better. This does mean that they tend to be bulkier and more expensive than models used for other disciplines, though. We advise purchasing at least 10x50 binoculars for comfortable views of a selection of targets; they’re light enough to hold for long periods of time, while offering good views of a selection of night-sky targets. The larger the binocular, the more you’ll be able to see, but be warned: They’ll also be heavier and will require a tripod for steady sights of the heavens. It isn’t just the aperture that you need to be mindful of. The quality of the optical system is an essential feature to consider for high-definition, excellent contrast and crystal-clear views. You’ll discover two major kinds of binoculars at reputable stockists: the porro-prism and roof-prism. Choose the Porro-prism design for a reliable and affordable piece of kit, making sure that the lenses feature a coating and the glass is of decent quality (we can vouch for multi-coated optics and BaK-4 prisms). If you wear spectacles, we advise choosing binoculars that offer eye relief of at least 14 to 15mm. Whichever model you decide to go for, there are plenty on the market to suit a variety of budgets, observing interests and abilities. Editor's Note 09/03/2025: Updated introduction to mention the Corn Moon and blood moon plus the new moon on September 21. Added in the Nikon Stabilized 12x25 S binoculars as the best compact IS binoculars. We provide honest and open reviews of binoculars, testing them in real-life settings and highlighting the good parts and the bad parts of each product. Binoculars come in a huge range of power and specs, each offering different features and capabilities. We review each binocular based on its build and intended use. For example, we don’t compare powerful, heavier and chunkier porro prism models with the slimmer and light roof prism models directly as they each have benefits and drawbacks depending on what we aim to observe and associated peripherals like tripods and adapters. We also check the optical performance of the binoculars, looking for aberrations, distortions and flaring present due to different quality glass (BaK-4, BK7 or K9) and lens coatings. We do this by observing a range of subjects and night sky objects with binoculars of differing magnification. Binoculars with 10x magnification are good for wide-field observation of the moon and scanning the Milky Way, whereas 15x and higher levels have been used to observe planets in more detail in addition to deep sky objects like The Andromeda Galaxy.

That's how easy it is now to get lost in the absolutely stunning scape that is our planet Earth from space as it streams live before your eyes. Sen, a company based in London, provides views of Earth from orbit, with the hopes of making an experience usually reserved for astronauts a little more accessible to the rest of humanity. It's live video of Earth from space, 24 hours a day and seven days a week. The overview effect is a phenomenon known to occur for those lucky enough to travel beyond the bounds of our gravity well, in which the view of our planet from space changes one's perception of his or home planet and humanity. Apollo 14 astronaut Ed Mitchell described it as \"an instant global consciousness,\" accompanied with \"an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world and a compulsion to do something about it.\" Sen launched three Ultra High Definition 4k cameras to the ISS on SpaceX's CRS-30 cargo mission to the space station in March 2024. The trio, collectively called SpaceTV-1, are mounted to the Bartolomeo platform on the European Space Agency's (ESA) Columbus module to create three unique views of Earth and the space station. One camera is oriented to capture the long curve of Earth's horizon, and the repeatedly rising and setting sun is visible as the ISS completes another orbit every 90 minutes. Another focuses directly on Earth below, showing a stretch about 155 miles (250 kilometers) across. The third camera looks at the space station's forward docking port, connected to the the Harmony module, and any visiting spacecraft that are docked there. Sen’s vision is to democratize space using video to inform, educate, inspire and benefit all humanity. To do this, the company is streaming real-time videos from space to billions of people, gathering news and information about Earth and space and making it universally accessible and useful. Sen is a data business using its own micro satellites and hosted cameras to stream real-time videos and information about Earth direct to individuals, creating a unique dataset for all humanity, empowering people and inspiring global change. Sen’s vision is a humanitarian one — to help raise awareness about planetary changes and to support those directly affected by events on Earth, and to help inform people about the reality of our existence in space. Sen will give people videos of Earth, other worlds and space. Augmented Reality will be used to overlay the story-telling power of video with additional information, providing multi-world data and unique new perspectives for humanity. Sen provides its streams from space for free. You can download Sen's mobile app or watch the company's stream directly on Sen.com or its YouTube channel.

They are offering $500 off the Unistellar Envision retail price but this limited-time pre-order sale finishes on Nov. 2 and there are under 200 units left. You can pre-order the Unistellar Envision AR smart binoculars for $999 at Unistellar. Our editor-in-chief, Tariq Malik, tested a demo of the Envisions before their general release and said, \"It felt like something out of Star Trek.\" They offer an augmented reality (AR) overlay that can identify night sky objects and features of local geography, like mountains and pathways. With Unistellar's first batch of 750 units already sold out, they released a second batch of 350 units on Oct. 23 and there are already under 200 units remaining. If you are keen to get your hands on these smart binoculars that make stargazing easy, then move fast, as we expect this pre-order to sell out soon. Save a huge $500 on the new augmented reality (AR) binoculars from Unistellar with this pre-order deal. They can identify stars and other deep space objects, as well as be a guide to local geography and hiking trails. They feature in our best smart binoculars guide and are the first smart binoculars to identify stars and deep sky targets. We tried them out and used them to observe stars near New York State. The Unistellar Envision binoculars felt revolutionary when they were announced in 2024, but now that they are almost in general release, it's a step closer to reality. We managed to have a look at them ahead of their October 2026 release date. The binoculars have a red augmented reality (AR) overlay that can identify over 1000 astronomical targets and guide you through the night sky. It also has a database of over 1 million terrestrial targets, like mountains and hiking trails, that can aid you when using them on outdoor adventures. We used them on a trip to the Hudson River in New York and found the binoculars easily identified the names and location of astronomical targets. They even identified the local mountain, Mt. Nebo, across the river during the demonstration. The target lock feature was also useful for helping others find your target by pointing in the direction of the overlay. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! These binoculars have been in the works for a long time and there has been a lot of excitement around the first smart binoculars for night-sky use.

    "content": "The century-old mystery of dark matter — the invisible glue thought to hold galaxies together — just got a modern clue. Scientists say they may be one step closer to confirming the existence of this elusive material, thanks to new simulations suggesting that a faint glow at the center of the Milky Way could be dark matter's long-sought signature. \"It's very hard to actually prove, but it does seem likely,\" Moorits Muru of the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam in Germany, who led the new study, told Space.com. Dark matter, which makes up about 27% of the matter in the universe, remains one of the biggest riddles in cosmology. It doesn't absorb or reflect light, making it completely invisible to telescopes. Despite decades of experiments, from underground particle detectors to orbiting space observatories, scientists have never detected it directly. Now, however, new computer simulations from Muru's team may have brought us a step closer to decoding the mystery. The findings, show that dark matter near the Milky Way's center might not form a perfect sphere as scientists long thought. Instead, it appears flattened, almost egg-shaped, and that shape closely mirrors the pattern of mysterious gamma rays observed by NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. This builds on research dating back to 2008, when Fermi first spotted a broad, hazy glow of high-energy light near the galactic core, stretching across some 7,000 light-years. The signal was far brighter than existing models could explain. Some scientists proposed that these rays could be the by-product of invisible dark matter particles known as WIMPs (short for weakly interacting massive particles) colliding and annihilating one another. Others argued they came from fast-spinning stellar remnants known as millisecond pulsars — ancient, rapidly spinning neutron stars that emit beams of radiation like cosmic lighthouses. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! The pulsar theory made sense because the gamma-ray glow appeared flattened and bulging, much like the Milky Way's star-filled central region. If dark matter were behind the glow, scientists had expected a smoother, rounder pattern. Muru and his team decided to put both ideas to the test. Using powerful supercomputers, they recreated how the Milky Way formed, including billions of years of violent collisions and mergers with smaller galaxies. Those violent events, the researchers found, left deep \"fingerprints\" on the way dark matter is distributed in the galactic core. When this complex history is factored in, the simulated dark matter halo no longer looks spherical. Instead, it takes on a flattened, egg-like form — matching the pattern of gamma-ray emission Fermi has observed, the new study reports. \"We're showing that dark matter also has this flattened shape,\" Muru said. \"So, it does match the [gamma ray] excess much better than expected before.\" The finding suggests that dark matter could still be a strong contender behind the Milky Way's mysterious glow. But it doesn't completely rule out pulsars, the researchers say. Both possibilities, the team concludes, are now \"essentially indistinguishable.\" If the excess truly arises from dark matter collisions, it would mark the first indirect evidence that WIMPs, a leading dark matter candidate, really exist. Definitive answers could come by the late 2020s, when the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) begins scanning the skies from its twin sites in Chile and Spain. The facility will be able to observe gamma rays at much higher resolution than Fermi, researchers say, potentially helping them distinguish between a swarm of pulsars, which have higher energies, and lower-energy annihilating dark matter particles. Muru added that gamma-ray observations of smaller dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way, whose cores also host dark matter in dense pockets, could further test both possibilities. \"That's where we hope to measure the signal,\" said Muru. \"We're really looking forward to these observations.\" Scientists are convinced dark matter is out there. The quest to detect it arguably remains both one of the most frustrating and most exhilarating challenges in modern physics. \"For some reason, it still eludes us,\" Muru said. \"And I think the mystery makes it even more interesting.\" The results were detailed in a paper published Oct. 16 in the journal Physical Review Letters.

    "content": "SpaceX launched its record-setting 139th mission of the year today (Oct. 23). A Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station today at 9:30 p.m. EDT (0130 GMT on Oct. 24), lofting the second and final satellite for the Spainsat Next Generation (NG) constellation. The two Spainsat NG spacecraft will provide \"military-grade secure communications to the Spanish Armed Forces and its partners,\" according to SatNews. SpaceX also launched the first Spainsat NG satellite, which lifted off atop a Falcon 9 this past January. If all goes to plan today, the Falcon 9's upper stage will deploy the Spainsat NG-2 satellite into a geosynchronous transfer orbit about 36 minutes after liftoff. The rocket's first stage, meanwhile, did not come back to Earth for a safe touchdown today — a rarity these days for Falcon 9 missions. The booster was in expendable mode \"due to the additional performance required to deliver this payload to orbit,\" SpaceX wrote in a mission description. This mission was the 22nd for this booster, the company added. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Today's flight was the 139th of 2025 for SpaceX, setting a new mark for the company. SpaceX has now launched 134 Falcon 9 missions this year — also a record — and five suborbital test flights of its Starship megarocket. In 2024, SpaceX performed 132 Falcon 9 flights, four Starship test launches and two liftoffs of its powerful Falcon Heavy rocket.

All the family can have fun using the ZWO Seestar S30 — it's compact, lightweight and easy to use. This really is a telescope that offers no-faff when it comes to viewing the night sky. Why you can trust Space.com Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test and review products. ✅ It's your first telescope: This scope is easy to use and set up, making it perfect for beginner astronomers. ✅ You want GoTo technology: You can easily find and track specific celestial objects with little or no prior knowledge. ❌ You want to travel with it: This telescope isn't the most portable as the tripod doesn't fold down entirely. 🔎 Celestron NexStar 4SE: If you want to view the planets and bright objects in the sky quickly and effortlessly, the Celestron NexStar 4SE will certainly do the job. ★★★★ The Celestron NexStar 4SE is a fantastic choice for beginners thanks to its fully computerized mount. Celestron's SkyAlign technology identifies the current date and time as well as your location to auto-find various targets within the night sky at the push of a button, making it easy for newcomers to get to grips with stargazing. This telescope has a 4-inch (102mm) aperture and a focal length of 1,325mm, enough to give sharp views of the planets and other bright sky objects. The downside is that this combination results in a fairly narrow field of view of only 1.2 degrees, which means you will struggle to fit bigger deep sky objects into the view. The NexStar 4SE comes with a 25mm Plossl eyepiece, but we think you'll get better results if you purchase an additional 32mm eyepiece and Barlow lens to make the most of the 241x highest useful magnification. This telescope is very sturdy in design, which is reflected in its weight. At 23 lbs (10.4 kg) the NexStar 4SE is far from the lightest on this list, nor is it the most portable, as its accompanying tripod doesn't fold down completely. Another thing to note about this telescope is how power-hungry it is; the mount tears through the 8xAA batteries required so quickly, we'd recommend using an external power source instead. Because of this, the NexStar 4SE is perhaps best suited for those who want to stargaze from their backyard rather than take it on the go. Solid and sturdy build, signature orange colors. Great for observing the moon and planets. Alignment correction can be tricky. ✅ You're a beginner: We found it easy to set up and take down, perfect for beginners. ✅ You want to take astro shots on your smartphone: The lens cap cleverly turns into a smartphone holder so you can capture images of the night sky. ❌ You aren't confident locating objects yourself: This telescope doesn't have GoTo technology, so you'll need to be able to locate specific celestial objects yourself (or with the help of a stargazing app).❌ You want detailed views of deep sky objects: While this telescope can give great views of planets and the moon, objects further away may appear a little underwhelming. 🔎 Celestron Inspire 100az: Aimed at beginners and those looking to upgrade, this 4-inch refractor performs best with the moon and planets. It comes with a lens cap that converts to a smartphone holder for easy astrophotography. ★★★★ The Celestron Inspire 100AZ is a great choice for beginners. Its user-friendly features and sturdy build make it a breeze to use even for the uninitiated, and it's a relatively affordable option compared to other telescopes in this guide. An achromatic refractor with a 4-inch/100mm aperture and a reasonably short focal length of 660mm, the Celestron Inspire 100AZ is designed to be used at home to view planets, the moon and deep sky objects. It's perched on a simple altazimuth mount that moves side to side and up and down, with a panhandle to lock it in the exact position you want. The 100mm aperture gathers a significant amount of light, allowing clear observations of faint celestial objects like nebulas and galaxies. Moreover, its long focal length provides substantial magnification for detailed views of planets and other nearby objects. During our Celestron Inspire 100AZ review, we noticed a small amount of false color (purple color fringing), and a slight blurring in the field of view. The latter is easily resolved by investing in one of the best eyepieces to make the most of the Inspire 100AZ's optical system. The slight amount of false color shouldn't be a dealbreaker for most, unless you are particularly keen on getting completely accurate colors. The Inspire 100AZ telescope comes with various accessories including two eyepieces, a red LED flashlight to maintain night vision, an accessory tray and a StarPointer Pro finderscope for locating celestial objects. We loved that the lens cap turns into a smartphone adapter, so you can take astro shots with your phone. ✅ You want a beginner-friendly, grab & go, easy-to-use telescope: We thought this was a great entry-level telescope that can find targets at the touch of a button and is great for on-the-go observations. ❌ You want a 'traditional' telescope: We found this telescope is completely useless without the app, so if you want a more traditional telescope without much of the newer technology, look elsewhere. 🔎 Celestron Astro Fi 130: A good telescope at an exceptionally good price, it has everything you'd need if you're just starting out, although we would recommend upgrading some of the pieces included. It can lose charge quickly in cold conditions, though, so consider buying an additional power source. ★★★½ Celestron's Astro Fi 130 is a very capable entry-level telescope with an affordable price tag. This well-constructed telescope consists of a Newtonian reflector and a sturdy aluminum tripod, 10mm and 25mm Kellner eyepieces offering 65x and 26x magnification, and a red dot finder. We'd strongly recommend purchasing some mid-range Plossl eyepieces to get the very best out of this scope. During our Celestron Astro Fi 130 review, we also noted that its batteries can be quick to drain in cold weather, so you might want to consider investing in 12V rechargeable batteries. This telescope is a great choice for beginners; it has everything they need to get started on their stargazing journey. The SkyAlign technology doesn't require prior knowledge of the night sky to get ready for viewing, and the Celestron SkyPortal app makes it easy to control the scope via your smartphone or tablet. The app can even recommend celestial objects to view and guide the computerized mount to them. The optics on the Astro Fi 130 allow for good views of the moon, offering enough magnification to see the craters and rilles on the lunar surface. Venus and Mars are also easy to pick out, and we were even able to catch a glimpse of the Andromeda Galaxy. Very sturdy build with well constructed tube and tripod. Makes use of SkyAlign technology for easy alignment. Great for lunar and planetary observing, but some views are fuzzy. ✅ You want to view a wide range of subjects: This scope has a large aperture which enables clear and detailed views of a wide range of celestial objects, including planets, deep-sky objects and nebulas. ✅ You're an experienced skywatcher: Although its easy setup is a dream for beginners, this scope is best suited for more advanced, passionate astronomers who want a full view of the universe. ❌ You want something portable: Portability isn't one of the Evolution 9.25's strengths, so it's best used for backyard gazing. 🔎 Celestron NexStar Evolution 9.25: A fantastic telescope best suited to experienced skywatchers, with a price tag to match its premium features. It's not the easiest to transport, but we think it's one of the best GoTo telescopes you can buy ★★★★½ The Celestron NexStar Evolution 9.25 is an outstanding GoTo scope that provides breath-taking views of the night sky. Its Schmidt-Cassegrain optical tube boasts a generous aperture of 235mm and a sturdy single-fork arm mount for stability and precision. The motorized mount features a rechargeable lithium-ion battery that allows for an impressive 10 hours of uninterrupted stargazing. The NexStar Evolution 9.25 comes with a good selection of accessories including a red dot finderscope, star diagonal, accessory tray, international AC adapter, hand control and two eyepieces (13mm and 40mm). Unlike the previous option in this list, the NexStar Evolution 9.25 is a great pick for more experienced skywatchers looking for a top-of-the-range telescope. It's an investment, sure, but it's impressively designed and boasts quality features. Astrophotographers may also find this telescope and its motorized mount to their liking as it can track the movement of celestial objects. You can easily control the NexStar Evolution 9.25 through the free Celestron SkyPortal app, which removes the need for a controller and frees up your hands during shoots. While it boasts an impressive design, this telescope is on the heavier side. As such, it's definitely not the most portable option, and we think it's best suited for backyard stargazing. Nevertheless, its robust construction and excellent features more than make up for this if you're not looking for a telescope to take on the go. A bit bulky and tricky to transport. Motorized mount a good choice for astrophotography. ✅ You want an automated telescope: Focusing, tracking, finding targets and stacking processed images is all automatic with this one.✅ You want to take deep sky images: The Origin can do this and more in just a few minutes, with little pre-knowledge required. ❌ You want a traditional telescope: This one doesn't have an eyepiece and only gives you views of the night sky on a mobile device. ❌ You're on a budget: At around $4,000, this telescope is on the pricier side. 🔎 Celestron Origin Intelligent Home Observatory: This (pricey) smart telescope can do every part of stargazing autonomously, and produces beautiful photos of the night sky in seconds. ★★★★½ The Celestron Origin Intelligent Home Observatory is a smart telescope unlike any other, in that it doesn't come with an eyepiece and has a built-in camera instead. Essentially, it allows you to view and image the night sky on a mobile device rather than through the telescope directly. The result is beautiful, clear images of deep sky objects and distant galaxies in a matter of seconds, even in areas with light pollution. During our Celestron Origin review, we found that within seconds of selecting an object in the accompanying app, the telescope could capture crystal clear images of nebulas with almost no noise. We liked the fact the 'snapshot' mode allows you to manually adjust settings to take single photos, too. That said, we didn't have much luck imaging planets, though it may be that we needed more time with the telescope to get to grips with it. Beginners will love this telescope thanks to the quick and easy setup. It can also handle every part of stargazing automatically, from focusing to tracking targets, which means you can start using it with no previous astronomy experience. The Origin app is easy to use and makes taking images effortless. The 'Planetarium View' shows users a representation of the night sky, and tapping on an object gives you the option to slew the telescope to it directly. The Celestron Origin looks like a standard telescope, but as mentioned above, it doesn't have an eyepiece. It's also on the heavy side, so it's not one to buy if you're looking for a telescope to take on the go. The nearly $4,000 price tag might also put off some potential buyers, but if you have the funds, we'd highly recommend this smart telescope. Bulky, but full of useful features on the mount. Beautiful, clear photos of deep sky objects. Motorized mount, but not a traditional telescope with an eyepiece. ✅ You're looking for a long-term telescope: There's no question that this telescope is pricey, but it's one that will last you for decades — it's not called 'The World's Most Beloved Telescope' for nothing.✅ You want to use it for astrophotography: Thanks to the smooth and accurate tracking, this scope is a great option for taking stunning astro images of deep sky objects. ❌ You're on a budget: Although this is definitely worth the money and we'd recommend it if your budget can stretch to it, it is very pricey. If you're on a budget or you're new to the medium, there are plenty of cheaper alternatives that will be more than good enough. 🔎 Celestron NexStar 8SE: An outstanding telescope with incredible optics that would suit a beginner, intermediate or advanced astronomer. It's great for astrophotography and gives beautifully bright and detailed views. Our only fault with it is that it can price out beginners. ★★★★½ The Celestron NexStar 8SE is one of the most flexible telescopes we've ever reviewed, and an ideal scope to learn and grow with. It's beginner-friendly, requiring no prior knowledge of the night sky to use, yet its stunning optics will be enough to satisfy intermediate to advanced astronomers as well. The only downside is the price, but if you have the funds, then we have no qualms about recommending it. The Celestron SkyAlign app helps you to align the scope using three bright stars, after which the entire operation is automated. You simply push the buttons on the handheld remote to select your desired celestial object and the motorized mount will slew the telescope towards your target. You can select from a range of objects categorized under 'solar system', 'stars' or 'deep sky', or you can select 'sky tour' which will automatically choose objects of interest to show you depending on your location. With an 8-inch aperture and Schmidt-Cassegrain optical design, this telescope is able to absorb a huge amount of light and offers bright and clear views of objects within our solar system and beyond. The catadioptric construction, which combines both refraction and reflection, has allowed Celestron to keep the distinctive orange tube relatively short, so it's eminently portable for taking with you on the hunt for darker skies. In our Celestron NexStar 8SE review we were seriously impressed by the smoothness and accuracy of the motorized fork arm and think it would be a great option for those seeking to do long-exposure astrophotography. However, the telescope does require a whopping 8x AA batteries, so we'd recommend buying some rechargeable batteries for this power-hungry scope to prevent future costs from mounting up. This is especially important considering that the range of the Celestron NexStar 8SE means that you'll likely be using it for many years to come. Can be transported as a fully-assembled setup. Outstanding optics, slightly tricky to align if you're not used to it. Easy to assemble and disassemble. ✅ You'll be traveling with it: This scope is our top choice for portability, so it's ideal if you plan on taking it away on camping trips or to areas with darker skies.✅ You're a beginner: If you just want to look at the moon and some planets, this is a great choice. ❌ You want good quality parts: This telescope has an element of 'you get what you pay for'. It's adequate for basic astronomy, but the tripod isn't the best quality, the optics could be better and it didn't have a premium feel. 🔎 Celestron Astro Fi 102: Best suited for viewing the moon and planets, this telescope is great for beginners and anyone with no prior experience. It can be a little tricky to setup initially, and it's not the best quality scope we've reviewed, but it'll do the job. ★★★½ The Celestron Astro Fi 102 has many benefits for newcomers to astronomy — it's relatively easy to set up, it has a motorized mount that automatically slews to your chosen target and it's in an affordable price bracket for a Maksutov-Cassegrain scope. It also has an array of convenient features and accessories to help you get started. One of the things we loved about this scope in our Celestron Astro Fi 102 telescope review was its portability. It has a compact body and weighs only 6 lbs (2.7kg), so it's extremely easy to carry with you out in the field. A word of caution, though, it's not as robust as some pricier scopes and probably couldn't withstand getting wet, so make sure to take a cover with you in case of passing showers. We also think it would feel more stable with a sturdier tripod as the one that's included felt a bit flimsy and needed some extra weighing down. This telescope comes with integrated WiFi so you can pair it with your phone using the Celestron SkyPortal app. The app contains around 100,000 celestial objects that you can select for the telescope to slew to, making it easy for beginners to navigate the sky above them with no prior knowledge. For the price, the Celestron Astro Fi 102 offers good views of the moon and its craters and closer planets such as Mars, Saturn and Jupiter. In good conditions, you can also hope to catch a glimpse of Uranus or Neptune. There is some sharpness drop-off towards the edges, but you'd need to purchase a much more expensive scope to avoid this. The plastic casing is acceptable but we don't think it could survive a substantial knock or a soaking from a passing shower as the seals aren't great, unlike some of the hardier, fully-sealed telescopes available. Highly transportable, but tripod needs weighing down. Initial setup can be tricky, but after that it's a breeze. Large database of celestial objects on SkyPortal. ✅ You want to travel with it: Most astrophotography involves traveling to dark sky sites, and this telescope is light enough to do just that. ✅ Your primary focus is astrophotography: We recommend this telescope as the best for astrophotography thanks to its amazing optics. ❌ You're looking for something super sophisticated: For those looking for high-end, sophisticated instruments and have the money to spend on them, a smart telescope would likely be a better fit. 🔎 Sky-Watcher Skymax 150 PRO: This telescope is perfect for astrophotographers who want to take it on shoots — it has great quality optics and an excellent build. It can accommodate plenty of accessories, although not all models come with a tripod. ★★★★ The Sky-Watcher Skymax 150 is perfect for astrophotographers thanks to its high-quality equatorial mount, which can suit both short and long-exposure shots. This telescope weighs in at just 13.23 lbs (6kg) so you can easily take it to different locations to seek out darker skies. It works well with many equatorial mounts and accommodates additional accessories like CCD or DSLR cameras, filter wheels and other add-ons. It also comes with a Vixen-style dovetail plate for easy mount attachment. This well-built Maksutov-Cassegrain telescope comes with a 28mm focal length eyepiece that provides 64x magnification, enabling you to see detailed views of various celestial objects. The Skymax 150's optics are impressive, delivering crisp, distortion-free views. It's a versatile telescope, perfect for capturing images of planets or distant galaxies and nebulas. It's also user-friendly and easy to accessorize, making it a great choice for astronomers and astrophotographers of all abilities. We also think the Skymax 150 is very good value compared to some other products on this list. The focuser is very smooth to operate and the telescope keeps a good amount of fine focus once it's been found, which is vital for long nights of astrophotography sessions. If this isn't the right telescope for your needs, but you're still after a Sky-Watcher scope, check out our Sky-Watcher deals hub to find more models from the brand. High quality build, excellent optics. Outstanding optics, with no sign of distortion. Great for a wide selection of astrophotography. ✅ You live in an urban area: This scope has a Smart Light Pollution Reduction feature that removes light pollution, s it's a great option if you don't live near a dark sky site.✅ You want simplicity: This is an incredibly sleek, all-in-one telescope that has no need for additional accessories and can take you to your chosen celestial objects with ease. ❌ You're on a budget: Unsurprisingly, this is an expensive bit of kit, so it'll price out most beginners and anyone who doesn't have a big budget. 🔎 Unistellar eQuinox 2: An easy-to-use motorized smart telescope that can locate night sky objects at the push of a button, the eQuinox 2 can have you exploring the stars in minutes without the need for prior knowledge, although its in-built camera isn't quite detailed enough. ★★★★½ The Unistellar eQuinox 2 packs all the latest smart technology in a sleek and modern motorized reflector telescope. It features a single power button on the fork arm, and all other controls are operated via the Unistellar app. Unlike traditional telescopes, you won't get a finderscope, eyepieces or other accessories included in the package because the Unistellar eQuinox 2 doesn't need them. The telescope contains a 6.2MP image sensor (an improvement over the 4.9MP sensor in the previous model) which captures several images one after the other and stacks them to give the appearance of a long exposure. As a result, objects become brighter as the image on your phone or tablet screen gets updated in real-time. While this may not appeal to astronomers who enjoy a more traditional approach to sky-watching, it has particular benefits when stargazing from urban locations thanks to the Smart Light Pollution Reduction feature, which removes the effects of light pollution as you view. We also like that it's very easy to save and share photos of what you're seeing in real-time. During our Unistellar eQuinox 2 review, we found it quick and easy to set up using the Autonomous Field Detection feature, after which you can use Unistellar's intuitive app to navigate automatically to different objects in the night sky. The menu screen displays a choice of objects that are currently available to view, as well as objects that will make an appearance within the next few hours. Alternatively, you can search for the specific object you're interested in in their huge database of 37 million stars and over 5,000 celestial objects. It's worth noting, though, that this high-tech telescope will set you back around $2,000. If your budget will stretch that far, then the Unistellar eQuinox 2 may be the telescope for you. Quick go to location of night sky objects. Doesn't orientate until well after twilight, easy once oriented. ✅ You want to see everything: While some telescopes are only good for seeing the moon and planets or deep space, this telescope is good for seeing all types of celestial objects.✅ You want a seamless experience: We found the motorized mount on this telescope very smooth and slick. ❌ You're a beginner: This telescope is intended for those with experience and knowledge of the sky and telescopes, so if you're just starting out, we'd suggest a more beginner-friendly model.❌ You want something lightweight: At 61 lbs (27.67kg), this telescope is heavier than most other choices in this guide. 🔎 Celestron Advanced VX 8 EdgeHD: Intended for serious amateurs, this optically excellent telescope is suitable for all types of visual astronomy with its rugged, lightweight computerized mount. If you know the sky and plan to be doing astronomy for a long time, this is the telescope to get. ★★★★½ Celestron's EdgeHD technology greatly improves Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes, especially for astrophotography. Normally, these telescopes produce a curved focal plane that doesn't match the flat surface of a CCD camera sensor. This mismatch causes field curvature, making stars at the image edges appear blurry. However, Celestron's EdgeHD technology solves this problem by providing a perfectly flat field. This enables astrophotographers to capture sharp and detailed photos across the entire frame without any blur. During our Celestron Advanced VX 8 EdgeHD review, we were pleased to find that the optics in the EdgeHD negate the blurred edges, creating a perfectly flat field right to the edge of the frame for pinpoint sharpness across the whole image. The Celestron Advanced VX 8 EdgeHD's optical performance is impressive, with crisp and clear views with no optical distortion or false color. The Celestron Advanced VX 8 EdgeHD can handle a weight of up to 30 lbs (13.6kg), ensuring stable and secure support for the tube and all your accessories. The package includes the standard NexStar+ hand controller, a 40mm eyepiece and access to Celestron's SkyPortal app and Starry Night Special Edition software. As a bonus, the optical tube assembly includes Celestron's Advanced VX mount, specifically designed for photographers. It can capture images across the meridian (an imaginary north-south line) without requiring a meridian flip. The setup also corrects errors periodically while tracking objects and includes an auto guider port. Views of Saturn and Jupiter are dramatic; globular clusters are resolved into stars; all the Messier Objects are plainly visible; and with a trained eye and a dark country sky, galaxies are visible down to 12th magnitude. It's a telescope you won't outgrow. Check out our Celestron deals page to see if you can snap up a bargain. EdgeHD optical design outperforms Schmidt-Cassegrain. Finds and tracks celestial objects reliably. Great views of all types of celestial objects. ✅ You want low investment: For casual viewing, this telescope is a great option with a low price point.✅ You don't want to spend ages setting it up: It arrives assembled and ready to go, so no complicated setup process needed. ❌ You want to find objects easily: It doesn't come with a finderscope, so anyone wanting to locate certain celestial objects easily may get frustrated.❌ You want all the extras: This package doesn't include a finderscope, so you'll need to either buy one separately or consider another telescope package that does. 🔎 Celestron FirstScope 76 Tabletop Telescope: If you have children who have been bugging you for a telescope and you can't quite commit to a moderately-priced instrument, then the FirstScope may be for you — especially if the moon and casual glances at the night sky are of interest. ★★★★ As you might have guessed from its name, the Celestron FirstScope 76 is designed to be a kid's first telescope. As you'd expect, it's really easy to set up and use, as it comes fully assembled in the box. It's ready to go as soon as you open it up, perfect for impatient kids who just want to get started. In our Celestron FirstScope 76 Tabletop telescope review, we noted that it's ideal for little hands since the tube can easily be pushed to the desired target. It's also fully equipped for decent night sky observations with two basic eyepieces included — 4mm and 20mm. It features a 76mm aperture (nearly three inches) and a fast focal ratio of f/3.95, which means you'll be able to spot celestial objects as well as some fainter deep-sky targets. You won't get close-up views, but it's good enough for newcomers to the field. Although they weren't totally pin-sharp, we were impressed with the great views of craters we saw and thought they were a great starting point. You'll notice that the telescope's base is short, meaning that you'll need to place it on a table in order to use it comfortably: a hindrance for some observers, however, if you have children who have been pestering you for a telescope, the FirstScope is the perfect solution, especially given its small build and ease of use. The Celestron FirstScope 76 is very portable, weighing only 4.5 lbs (2.04kg). However, being a tabletop telescope, it's not really one you want to use in the wild as it'll need somewhere to stand. If you're weary of its low price-point, don't be: The Celestron FirstScope is built very sturdily with durable, non-glossy plastics, so it looks and feels premium too. Perhaps the only real complaint we have about the FirstScope is that is doesn't come with a finderscope — a tool that aids in aligning the telescope. Having one would enhance the overall experience for young astronomers, so we'd highly recommend purchasing a red dot finder to go with this telescope (thankfully, they're relatively inexpensive). Good quality build for the price. Provides a 'wow factor' for young observers. Optics struggle to pick out detail. ✅ You want no-faff portability: The Seestar S30 is quick to set up and use, especially as the telescope and app do all the work for you. ✅ You want a family-friendly telescope: Suitable for children to beginners and beyond, the Seestar S30 is the perfect family-friendly telescope. ❌ You want complete accuracy: While the Seestar S30 performed well, occasionally it struggled to find night-sky objects.❌ You want to view deep-sky objects in detail: While the Seestar S30 could locate and image deep-sky objects, some galaxies and nebulas appeared tiny in the field. 🔎 ZWO Seestar S30: An ideal telescope for smart capabilities and portability, with an ease of use meaning that any member of the family could give it a go ★★★★ The Seestar S30 is an incredibly compact and neat telescope that is easy to set up. It's super lightweight, weighing only 1.65 kg, making it ideal for portability. Plus, it's a smart telescope which lends itself well to children and beginners so all the family can have fun trying this telescope out. Part of what makes this telescope so compact is the small tripod it sits on. The tripod legs don't extend. However, this isn't a concern as you control this telescope with a smartphone app, with the objects you're viewing appearing on your phone screen. This telescope can be easily placed on garden tables or even pavements and still capture amazing views of the night sky. The alt-azimuth mount allows the aperture arm to move in all directions; up and down and left and right so you're guaranteed great views of the night sky. While the telescope aperture is only 30 mm (1.18 inches), the Sony IMX662 CMOS imaging sensor sufficiently captures the light that reaches it. Typically for such a compact refractor telescope, the focal length is 150 mm (5.9 inches) but this does provide a solid f/5 instrument. The only disappointing thing regarding this telescope was that some deep-sky objects appeared small in the field. One of the really impressive things about this super smart and portable telescope is just how quiet it is when sourcing night-sky objects. In our review of the Seestar S30, our reviewer noted, \"it's so quiet that in the dark, we had to double-check that it had really moved as commanded.\" There are various ways of searching for night-sky objects using this smart telescope. Beginners can rely on the app to show them the most famous night-sky objects. There is also the option to browse the stargazing or solar system categories and choose objects from there. But, for more experienced users, the 'Sky Atlas', which is a basic planetarium software, allows you to pinch and zoom in and out to select objects you'd like to view. It's so simple to select your object, press the 'Go-To' button and let the Seestar S30 do everything else. Our reviewer was impressed with the speed it found objects in, with it taking between 10 and 20 seconds to find night sky objects. This really is a telescope that offers no-faff when it comes to stargazing.

There's a lot of jargon and technical knowledge that surrounds them. Plus, you've got hundreds of options to choose from, with multitudes of different configurations, settings, all at a wide range of prices. The good news is that quality of telescopes has drastically improved in recent years, so most models' quality is usually pretty good these days; you're unlikely to end up with a total dud. That said, there are better options than others, and we've endeavored to only include the very best in this guide. The most important factor in choosing a telescope is the optical quality it provides. You'll also want to think about what aperture you need and whether you need a more portable model or a larger, more powerful one. Beginner telescopes are a brilliant option if you're just starting out in the field. In order to get the best possible views of the night sky, you'll also need to consider where you're observing from, what objects you'd like to see in particular, your setup if you're going to attempt astrophotography, and more. If you're planning on roaming with your telescope, weight and portability are other factors to take into consideration. We'd strongly advise you to stick to reputable telescope dealers to buy your scope from. That way you'll be sure to get exactly what you've ordered, and many will provide a warranty with your purchase. Astronomical equipment businesses also tend to offer the best deals on their products, and have advisors on hand to help you make the right decision for you. Below, you'll find a breakdown of the different types of telescopes you can buy, as well as which model we think is best. There are three main types of telescopes: reflector, refractor and catadioptric telescopes. Reflectors have a main mirror to gather and focus light, whereas refractors have an objective lens. Catadioptrics have a main mirror, and a lens of the same diameter. All three of these types of telescopes have 'sub-types' which vary by design. For example, the most basic reflector telescopes have a Newtonian design, which means they have a main mirror and a smaller, secondary one to divert the light at right angles to the eyepiece from the top of the telescope. As we've mentioned above, nowadays, you're spoilt for choice when it comes to quality (and relatively affordable!) telescopes. So, which type should you opt for? We think Newtonian reflector telescopes on a simple undriven alt-azimuth mount (known as a 'Dobsonian') offer the best value in terms of aperture. However, if you are interested in learning your way around the night sky 'the old fashioned way', then a Dobsonian telescope might be the way to go. They don't come with any bells and whistles, so you'll need to arm yourself with a star map to make sense of stargazing. Dobsonians collect a lot of light, and they have enough resolving power to deliver breathtaking views of celestial objects. Dobsonian telescopes over 6 inches in aperture tend to be pretty large and imposing, so you'll need to consider where it can be stored if you purchase one. A garden shed or garage might be the best option. If you add an equatorial or computerized mount, Newtonian or refractor telescopes become much more expensive. You can find several types of computerized mounts for Newtonian telescopes: Dobsonians (push-to or GoTo), single time-mounted (tracking or GoTo) and German equatorial (GoTo). For reference, for a computerized push-to Dobsonian, you'll be looking at spending about twice as much than for a manual model of the same aperture, while a GoTo will set you back almost four times the price of its manual counterpart. A premium Newtonian on a German equatorial mount can be as much as ten times more expensive than one on a manual mount! If ease of use, portability and convenience are high on your requirements, and you like gadgets, then a short focal length refractor of up to 4 inches or a catadioptric (Schmidt- or Maksutov-Cassegrain) up to 5 inches on a computerized mount may well fit the bill. These are versatile telescopes with high magnification which enables you to observe amazing details on the moon and planets. Achromatic refractors with short focal lengths typically display a degree of false color around the edges of bright objects like the moon because they can't focus all wavelengths of light to a precise point. Most users are happy to accept this drawback because refractors are so easy to use and care for; however, if you're after a clean, high-contrast view without false color, the Maksutov is the best option here. The best views of the night sky are obtained through apochromatic refractors. Using special glass objectives, they focus all wavelengths of light to as near a single point as possible and are free of false color. It is worth noting though that apochromats cost around four times as much as equivalent-sized achromats. It's up to you whether you're prepared to invest that kind of money into your skywatching. Refractors work by bending — or refracting — the light they gather to give you a view of your astronomical target. Easy to set up, the refractor is best suited to planetary and lunar viewing, using lenses to collect and focus light to form an image, while an eyepiece magnifies the view. The refractor has a fairly straightforward design, with a main objective lens at one end and a star diagonal with a threaded eyepiece at the other. Being intuitive to use, the refractor is often a popular instrument for novice astronomers, given their low maintenance. Refractors are usually affixed to a simple alt-azimuth mount, that slews from side to side and up and down to locate a desired target. Being easy to use means these telescopes are also simple to manufacture (at least for novice models) and, therefore, cheaper to buy. The downside is that the higher the aperture, the more expensive the refractor gets. Unfortunately, this means that a basic refractor is also the number one target to replicate in mail-order catalogs and other non-reputable vendors, so caution must be exercised when purchasing this type of telescope. Refractors are particularly good at giving highly magnified and high contrast images and, because of this, are ideal instruments to use when looking at solar system targets such as the moon and the planets. The best refractors usually have an aperture of 2 inches (60mm) or more and will provide you with reasonable views of astronomical objects. A 3 to 4-inch (80 mm - 90 mm) would be best suited if you're looking for a larger aperture. The drawback of a refractor is that it can suffer from chromatic aberration, also known as color fringing. When a single lens doesn't focus all the colors emitted from a target object at the same point, bright objects such as the moon, Venus or Jupiter usually have a colored halo around them. To reduce this problem, many refractors are manufactured as achromatic or APOchromatic (also known as Extra Dispersion (ED) telescopes). The achromatic refractor is cheaper than the apochromatic refractor and, combined with its efficiency, is often the type of telescope that novice astronomers go for. Even if you choose the more expensive achromatic, you'll likely get a stubborn degree of purple fringing around some targets. Unless you're a seasoned skywatcher and you can afford to go for the more expensive apochromatic — which corrects for such an effect by using exotic glass for the lenses — this degree of color fringing will not ruin your observing experience to any great extent. If you decide to go for the expensive option, you will be stunned by the views you will get through these excellent telescopes. Be warned, though, you might find that some apochromatics come without a tripod, something that you'll have to buy separately along with any accessories. There are two common types of reflector telescope — the Newtonian and the Dobsonian. The way these instruments operate is the same — they both use mirrors to reflect light to create an image of the object you're looking at. The Newtonian telescope comprises a curved light-collecting mirror, which can be found at the tube's base. The light that hits this mirror is reflected back to the front of the tube, where a smaller flat mirror — oriented at 45-degrees — brings light to the observer who can see their chosen object. The Newtonian can be found on alt-azimuth mounts, but you shouldn't be too surprised to find this type of reflector is more popularly affixed to an equatorial mount, allowing the telescope to follow the rotation of the sky while being aligned with your hemisphere's celestial pole. This reflector is a favorite in the amateur astronomy community due to its versatility in observing a wide selection of astronomical targets and allowing for astrophotography. With Newtonians, you can also buy a large aperture for less money — for instance, an eight-inch (203.2 mm) reflector would cost you less than a refractor with the same aperture, allowing you to get much more value for your money. Newtonian reflector telescopes do require some maintenance. The mirrors must be aligned periodically to ensure that they are reflecting light properly. The mirrors can also become tarnished over time, so they may need to be repainted. If you choose a Newtonian reflector telescope, select one with a protective mirror coating. This will help extend the mirrors' life and make them easier to maintain. Some beginners to the hobby of astronomy might find setting up and using an equatorial mount tricky — that's where the Dobsonian comes in. These telescopes give the capabilities of a reflector without the complexities an equatorial mount will bring since it employs an alt-azimuth mount. Dobsonians are very simple to use and can easily be pulled into orientation when looking at astronomical objects. If you're not confident in navigating your telescope though, then GoTo or computerized Dobsonians and Newtonians (that slew to objects for you using an in-built motor) are on the market — but cost more. Learn more about these in our 'What are Dobsonian telescopes' guide. Whatever reflector you choose, these telescopes are excellent for low-magnification targets such as galaxies and many nebulas. Ideal for astrophotography, the catadioptric is an excellent instrument for taking a wide range of astronomical targets and is manufactured in order to take the best parts of two kinds of telescopes: The reflector and the refractor. What's more, the catadioptric takes advantage of a lightweight design, meaning that it's much more portable than other kinds of telescopes and its sealed optics promote little to no maintenance. The only major downside to choosing a catadioptric is that the vast majority can be expensive. However, if you are on a strict budget, picking up one of these instruments isn't unheard of — you've just got to make sure to shop around. While refractors use lenses, and reflectors make use of mirrors, to create and magnify an image, the catadioptric makes use of both lenses and mirrors for high-definition and superior views. During your observations, light from your chosen target passes through to a lens, which corrects or reduces aberration that distorts the view that is later taken in through the eyepiece. Curved primary mirrors then reflect this light onto a secondary mirror, which then reaches your eyes. You will find two kinds of Catadioptric telescopes — the Schmidt-Cassegrain and the Maksutov-Cassegrain. The Maksutov-Cassegrain, also affectionately known as the 'Mak', corrects the optical problem that is experienced by reflectors — an aberration effect called 'coma,' which can make objects look distorted and appear like they have a tail. This effect is reduced or banished with the combined efforts of a spherical mirror and a meniscus lens, the latter of which is 'weakly negative'. The Maksutov is also adept at correcting for chromatic aberration, or color fringing, a distortion that creates an unwanted purple or blue edging around bright night-sky objects. Packed into its short optical tube is a system that allows you to target higher magnification objects such as the planets, moon and double stars. Additionally, if you struggle to find objects and your way around the night sky, then both this type of catadioptric telescope and the Schmidt-Cassegrain can be found in abundance and equipped with a GoTo system. The other most common kind of catadioptric, the Schmidt-Cassegrain, offers similar capabilities to the Maksutov and will allow you to make general observations of planetary targets and stars. It is also possible to expand the telescope's field of view with the help of corrector lenses, enabling exquisite views of an even wider selection of astronomical targets. A finder scope is a low-power (low magnification) telescope that sits on your main telescope, to help you track down your desired subject. Your main telescope will typically have a narrow field of view, meaning you'll see only a little portion of the sky when you look through it. Your finder scope, with a wider field of view, assists you in pointing your telescope, making it easy to hone in on your target with minimal searching and repositioning. Center your subject in the finder scope's frame; there are usually crosshairs or a dot so you know when it's central. Now when you look through your telescope's eyepiece, your subject will be centered here too. Many telescopes include a finder scope with the package. But if you need to purchase one separately, it's important to know that there are two main types. One has a straight-through view, and one has a right-angled view. If you have a Newtonian reflector telescope you'll want a right-angle finder. And if you use a refractor or catadioptric due to the location of their eyepieces you should buy a finder with a straight-through view. Some finder scopes will also be magnified — higher magnification and a narrower field may be desirable if you need pinpoint accuracy. You'll also come across the terms 'inverted' or 'erect image.' The latter means the finder scope has a correcting prism that flips the image the 'right way up’ (top-to-bottom) and ‘around’ (left-to-right). Some finder scopes don't have a correcting prism, so you see either a back-to-front image or upside down. This can be disorientating and make finding subjects more difficult, especially if you're just starting out and wondering why your telescope's controls seem to be inverted. Time to dispel jargon myths with a bit of a telescope glossary. The larger a telescope's aperture (the size of its main lens or primary mirror) the more light is collected and more fine detail is revealed. For example, a 200 mm aperture collects four times more light than a 100 mm telescope. Under ideal conditions, a 100 mm telescope reveals stars down to magnitude +11.8, while a 200 mm telescope will show stars down to magnitude +13.3. A 100 mm telescope will 'split' a double star separated by 1.5 arcseconds and resolves a three-kilometer lunar crater; however, a 200 mm telescope resolves a crater just 1.5 km across and a double star separated by just 0.6 arcseconds. Resolution is limited by the telescope's optical quality and the steadiness of the Earth's atmosphere. Telescopic magnification depends on the telescope's focal length (the distance between the objective lens/primary mirror and the point of focus of the light it collects) and the focal length of the eyepiece used. Magnification is calculated by dividing the telescope's focal length by the eyepiece's focal length. For example, a 100 mm telescope with a focal length of f/8 (eight times the telescope's aperture) has a focal length of 800 mm; used in conjunction with an eyepiece of 10 mm it will deliver a magnification of 80 times (800 divided by 10). With any telescope, the range of useful magnification depends on a telescope's aperture and focal length, combined with the focal length of the eyepiece. Too low a magnification (taking in as wide an area as possible) will actually waste light since the 'exit pupil' of the eyepiece will be larger than the diameter of the pupil of your dark-adapted eye. On average, the adult pupil will dilate to around 7 mm in dark conditions. Therefore the exit pupil delivered by an eyepiece ideally needs to be 7 mm or smaller so that all the light gathered by the telescope — especially when attempting to see faint objects — can be taken in. Exit pupil can be calculated by dividing the telescope's aperture by the magnification delivered by any particular eyepiece. Eyepieces work by magnifying the light focused by the telescope's primary mirror or objective lens. Every telescope eyepiece has a specific focal length (given in millimeters), and the shorter this figure is, the higher the magnification. To calculate the magnification provided by any particular eyepiece on any telescope, divide the telescope's focal length by the focal length of the eyepiece used. For example, a 1000 mm focal length telescope (say, a 100 mm refractor of f/10, or a 200 mm Newtonian of f/5) will deliver a magnification of 100 with a 10 mm eyepiece (1000 divided by 10 = 100). Although any telescope can give impressively high magnifications using short focal length eyepieces, there is a point when increasing magnification will provide a worse image rather than improve it. When an object is magnified, its brightness is reduced as the finite amount of light is spread over a larger area. In addition, increasing magnification exacerbates the amount of atmospheric turbulence visible; therefore, high magnifications can only be used when seeing conditions are good. Finally, high magnification is practical only with driven telescopes. Otherwise, the object will quickly drift out of the field of view. As a guide, your highest power eyepiece should deliver a magnification double the telescope's aperture in millimeters — for example, 200x on a 100 mm telescope, 400x on a 200 mm telescope, and so on. It's best to have at least three good quality eyepieces that deliver low, medium and high magnifications — say around 50x, 100x and 200x. Taking as an example a 100 mm f/10 telescope, those eyepieces would be of 20 mm, 10 mm and 5 mm focal length. Let's assume that these particular eyepieces are of the commonly used Plossl variety. A field of view around one degree across (an area of 0.8 square degrees) is given by the 20 mm eyepiece — ideal for sweeping the deep skies and finding objects. The 10 mm eyepiece will just take in the half-degree diameter moon and have a field covering just one-quarter that of the 20 mm eyepiece. With its high magnification, the 5 mm eyepiece has a field of view covering just one-sixteenth that of the 20 mm eyepiece and can only be used when seeing conditions allow.

By looking at the build of the Optical Tube Assembly (OTA) we can give a clear breakdown to our readers. This includes discussing the type of telescope (refractor, reflector, catadioptric), how many parts the OTA consists of, the size of the OTA and the clarity of the lens. This is important because some telescopes require advanced collimation (alignment) of the mirrors and consistent cleaning to make sure that they perform at their best. Telescope accessories, like eyepieces and mounts, are assessed in terms of their functionality and quality. Alt-azimuth and equatorial mounts are tested in terms of smooth movement, especially if they are motorized. Star alignment is another important feature we test, as it can range from aligning a finder scope to advanced laser collimation techniques. Considering that telescopes are complicated optical instruments, we think about how much astronomical knowledge a user would need to operate the telescope with ease. Powerful intricate telescopes often require regular collimation and movement can misalign the mirrors meaning that they require adjustment before every observation. Our recommendations also include whether we think the telescope is portable and suitable for traveling to dark-sky sites. The most important part of testing a telescope is seeing how powerful its observational abilities are. We give examples of what we were trying to observe and say how good the image was, with honesty. With a range of telescopes, our reviewers have observed the moon, Jupiter and a range of Messier objects, checking for a range of aberrations and distortions in the image. To give you a review you can trust, we test the claims of the telescope manufacturers against their real-life use. Our staff and freelance reviewers are seasoned stargazers with many years of experience using telescopes. We also work with astronomy experts to ensure that we are giving you the most accurate and important information on telescope use.

    "content": "Get ready stargazers! The Orionid meteor shower peak begins tonight, welcoming a spectacular natural light show that could see a flurry of shooting stars spawned by Halley's Comet brighten the dark, moonless sky. The 2025 Orionid meteor shower peak begins overnight on Oct. 20-21, when 10-20 shooting stars may be visible streaking across the night sky from a point of origin known as a \"radiant\", located close to the red star Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion. While tonight is the peak, Orionid shooting stars can be seen from Oct. 2 to Nov. 7 as Earth passes through the debris trail shed by comet 1P/Halley. During that time, particles cast off from that ancient body collide with our planet at speeds of up to 41 miles per second (66 kilometers per second), burning up in a magnificent display as they're overwhelmed by the friction of atmospheric entry. The Nikon Z8 excels in just about every department and we rate it as the best overall camera out there. Check out our Nikon Z8 review for a more in-depth look. One of the best times to spot Orionid meteors will be in the pre-dawn hours of Oct. 21, when the constellation Orion will be positioned high above the southern horizon in a moonless sky for viewers in the U.S. The shower peaks around the monthly new moon phase, meaning that there'll be no natural light pollution to ruin the cosmic show. First, locate the red star Betelgeuse using a smartphone astronomy app. Then, pick a patch of sky 40 degrees away in the direction of your local zenith, which is the point directly above your head. Remember, the width of your outstretched fist accounts for roughly 10 degrees in the night sky! Here, the meteor trails will be at their longest. Be sure to allow 20-30 minutes for your eyes to adapt to the dark, and use a red light if needed in order to avoid ruining your night vision. Don't forget, we're in astronomical autumn now, so be sure to wrap up warm and to let someone know where you're observing from if you head to a remote dark sky location. Robert Lunsford of the American Meteor Society notes that there will still be plenty of meteor activity after the peak starts, so there's no need to worry if clouds appear to ruin the show that first early morning show! \"The Orionids will peak in the period of October 21-23,\" Lunsford told Space.com in an email. \"Rates will fall very slowly after these dates so the mornings of October 24-26 will still provide hourly rates in excess of 10 per hour when viewing from rural dark skies. Note by then the radiant will have moved eastward into western Gemini so folks should not be surprised to see these meteors shooting from that constellation instead of Orion\". Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! The Orionids aren't the only meteor shower active over the coming weeks. Both the Northern Taurid and Southern Taurid meteor streams are currently active, which could give rise to spectacular fireball events in the period leading up to their separate peaks in early November.

    "content": "The Australian company Gilmour Space aims to make a second attempt to reach space in 2026, having turned a cow paddock into a launch pad. Gilmour Space launched its first Eris rocket on July 29 from the Bowen Orbital Spaceport in coastal Queensland, but the rocket fell to Earth just 14 seconds after liftoff. Despite the setback, the TestFlight1 mission laid the foundation for sovereign launch from Australian soil, according to Adam Gilmour, CEO and co-founder of Gilmour Space Technologies, speaking at the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Sydney, Australia, on Oct. 3. \"We had 14 seconds of flight time, 23 seconds of engine burn time. And we have obviously gotten a lot of data out of it, a lot of information, and we were pretty happy with it,\" Gilmour said. He added that, on average, it takes a rocket company an average of three launch attempts to get to orbit successfully. Behind July's brief flight lay years of groundwork. The journey to the pad involved challenges and hurdles in terms of engineering, financing, regulations and licensing — including 24 different permits from Queensland, along with environmental and airspace approvals — as well as finding a location for a launch pad. \"We drove 2,000 kilometers [1,240 miles] out into the middle of Australia, into an area that I think is very similar to what the surface of Mars looks like,\" Gilmour said. \"When we did the launch, a lot of the media said Gilmour launched a rocket in a cow paddock. I got offended — but then you go down there, and you do see cows.\" Now, with infrastructure in place, and having worked with regulators, the company is plotting its return to flight for 2026. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! \"We are going to be launching again next year,\" Gilmour said. \"We're going to be doing more launch attempts, so we're not going to give up.\" This, he added, is the start of what could be a bright future for the Australian space sector. \"I think the future looks fantastic … If you look at all the building blocks of what the country's done, we now have rules and regulations that permit orbital launches. \"I think there's at least four or five companies in Australia that have satellites operationally working in space, which is really, really good,\" Gilmour said. \"And we are well capitalized. So I think in the next five years, you're going to see more launches out of Australia.\" Join our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

In addition to my take on what the TSLA board should or shouldn’t decide, we’ve got a pile of EV lease deals, some hot, upcoming new electric Jeep models, and a look at some of the ways the end of the Federal EV tax credit isn’t the end at all.

Like Elon could go anywhere else and even make a fraction of what he makes at Tesla. His other own companies don't have the market cap to offer him comparable stock options, nor would the private investors allow that kind of stock dilution to their investments. He literally can't go to any another company in the world and make more money even if Tesla only pays him 1/10th of what he wants.. He can rage quit out of spite but he can't make the obscene money he makes anywhere but at Tesla so he isn't going anywhere else unless he is forced out.

    "content": "The two largest independent advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, have both recommended a “no” vote on the proposed pay package for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, citing many concerns about shareholder dilution and other terms of the plan. In September, Tesla’s board proposed a stock award worth up to $1 trillion for CEO Elon Musk. It includes several milestones regarding Tesla stock and product performance, each of which unlocks tens of billions of dollars for Musk. It’s the largest award proposed for any CEO of any company by multiple orders of magnitude – with previous proposed Musk awards holding the second and third place positions as well. In addition to that much-reported proposal, another proposal is up for a vote which would create a special share reserve of 208 million shares (current value $92 billion) which the Tesla board can give to Elon Musk with no strings attached. Both proposals will be voted on by TSLA shareholders at Tesla’s shareholder meeting on November 6. There are a lot of details and history behind this proposal which we at Electrek have covered extensively. Most recently, I went over most of the details of the stock award in this article: Elon Musk’s $1 trillion stock award gets more ridiculous the more you look into it. But now, both of the largest independent advisory companies have chimed in to point out concerns about the proposals in front of shareholders. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis are “proxy advisory” companies, both of which who do research and analysis of company proposals and then make recommendations to shareholders about how to vote for them. Company boards often have their own recommendation on an issue, which may or may not be the best for shareholders – especially if those boards are lacking in independence, and may make recommendations that favor management personally over shareholders as a whole. So, it’s important for independent outside advisors to have a look at proposals and give their take. Proxy advisory firms are generally less interested in the specifics of what industry a company is in, and just want to ensure good corporate governance – independent and diverse boards, appropriate executive compensation, and so on. These recommendations are often followed by institutional investors – banks and other large companies that hold large chunks of shares in many companies, many of which they won’t track deeply. So they hire advisory firms to help them make decisions on votes. ISS and Glass Lewis combined make up the vast majority of the proxy advisory market, so when they make recommendations, it can sway a lot of votes. And, in looking at the proposals in front of Tesla investors for this year’s shareholder meeting, both of them have stated significant concerns. On Friday, ISS stated that while it recognizes Musk’s “track record and vision” and the board’s intent to retain him for those reasons, the pay package “locks in extraordinarily high pay opportunities over the next ten years” and “reduces the board’s ability to meaningfully adjust future pay levels.” It also pointed out that the proposal is designed in such a way as to allow extremely high pay for Musk even if most milestones aren’t achieved, and stated that its “astronomical” size would dilute shareholder value and voting rights. Today, Glass Lewis echoed ISS’ statement, saying that dilution to shareholders “warrants significant concern.” It recommended shareholders to vote against all three pay-related proposals (2, 3 and 4), and to vote against re-election of board members Ira Ehrenpreis and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, though it did recommend voting for the re-election of Joseph Gebbia. Electrek obtained a full copy of Glass Lewis’ report, but not of ISS’. Glass Lewis calls proposal 3 “particularly concerning,” as it ties a 208 million share award for Musk to the creation of a pool of 60 million shares for all other Tesla employees combined, and notes that the employee pool is only necessitated by the board’s previous action draining the pool of shares for employees and giving them all to Musk. It suggests that shareholders vote down this proposal, and that the company put up a separate, clean proposal to refill the employee pool. And proposal 4, the $1 trillion award, is noted as being excessively dilutive for current shareholders and allowing too much concentration of ownership into Musk’s hands, along with producing more “key man risk” for Tesla. Glass Lewis states that attaching Tesla’s future so inextricably with Musk’s is risky, given his “vast and varied interests,” and suggests it would be reasonable to “sets parameters that limit the key man risk to which shareholders are exposed,” which the company has chosen not to do. It also notes concern over promising billions of dollars of awards to Musk for doing some of the most basic things that a CEO is meant to do, such as developing a succession plan. Shareholders should “reasonably be concerned that the committee feels the need to compel Mr. Musk to perform such duties, particularly at such cost to shareholders.” The milestones involved in the award are noted as potentially being easy to achieve, particularly given that the board can decide on a whim to grant a tranche of stock even if a product milestone isn’t reached, if market realities have changed between now and then (a “covered event”) resulting in those product milestones becoming unrealistic. The board is given significant discretion in this matter. Finally, Glass Lewis points out the danger of allowing Musk to vote his entire ownership stake in favor of his own pay, which was not the case in the last shareholder vote over Musk’s pay. This means essentially a free 15% head-start on the vote, due purely to Musk’s own shares. Glass Lewis cites surveys of its clients and others, stating that a majority of both shareholders and non-investors think that executives should not be able to vote on their own pay packages in stating that Musk’s ability to vote on this proposal does not align with market expectations. Glass Lewis also stated its concerns with a proposal for Tesla to invest in xAI. xAI is a private company which Musk started started to compete with Tesla (and is currently subject to a lawsuit for that reason). Glass Lewis said that this matter should be decided by the board, not shareholders. In sum, Glass Lewis’ recommendations ran counter to the Tesla’s board recommendation in almost every case. The only proposals they agreed on are the election of Gebbia, ratification of Tesla’s auditor, and proposals 8 and 9, two shareholder proposals recommending Tesla adopt standards on sustainability and child labor. Tesla has, expectedly, responded with attacks against both firms. Both ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended “no” votes on Musk’s pay packages in the past, citing similar concerns over their size and the amount of dilution which they would cause to shareholders. And Tesla has spoken out against the two firms in those instances. In this instance, Tesla attacked ISS, suggesting that its status as a disinterested advisor (which does not hold shares in the company) somehow makes it less capable of seeing the reality of the situation. It also notes past shareholder votes on other proposals, which were different from the proposals on the table today. Musk also repeatedly called ISS “terrorists” for their objective analysis of his pay package. And after Glass Lewis’ recommendation today, Tesla levied another attack, making similar points about votes on past proposals, rather than the proposals in front of shareholders today. Separately, Tesla also attacked a group of pension funds which are invested in TSLA, mocking them for having returns of 7-13% (which, collectively, is above average for large stable funds). Tesla even hired an outside PR company to publicize this attack. We’ve been clear here, over and over, about how ridiculous this stock plan is. However, despite it seeming ridiculous at first glance, it only gets more ridiculous the deeper you look into it. I went over it all this weekend in the article mentioned above, Elon Musk’s $1 trillion stock award gets more ridiculous the more you look into it. It’s long, but if you want more detail, that’s the place to go. In short, the analyses presented by these outside firms looking at Tesla’s shareholder proposals, and the environment around them, are clear-headed and made in the interest of Tesla shareholders. If shareholders actually read the letters or analyses involved with their own interests in mind, they will likely be persuaded. Meanwhile, Tesla’s responses have been filled with the sort of language that someone would expect out of an entity that is trying to deceive – the sort of language we’ve gotten used to in our politics. They read as campaign messages or advertising efforts, not as the result of deep analysis. And Musk also threatened his own company just yesterday, once again, in the hope that shareholders will feel trapped enough that they vote to retain him. If the only place people read about this is on twitter, which Elon Musk bought for the purpose of spreading his own propaganda and shutting down dissent (including using bots to do so), they might get one sense of what the proposals mean. In that upside-down world, TSLA investors can only benefit as the stock goes up, and Musk only benefits if the stock goes up. I am a Tesla owner. Due to Musk's political contributions to push our democracy towards fascism, of which a portion of my purchase funded, I will not be buying another Tesla. If Musk divests from Tesla because he didn't get his Trillion $$$, then I will continue being a loyal Tesla customer. Tesla investors need to determine what percentage of Tesla owners out there feel the same way. Declining global sales certainly provides a clue. But looking into the actual details of the proposals, it becomes apparent that Musk can get awarded with a larger payday than any CEO ever for doing nothing at all, that that award comes at the cost of every other Tesla employee and the voting rights of every Tesla shareholder, and that better options are available which would maintain the rights of Tesla investors while also compensating its CEO (whose performance has been exceptionally bad recently). But those options have not been provided to shareholders to vote on, as Tesla’s board is working more in the benefit of their friend Elon, rather than the benefit of TSLA shareholders as a whole.

    "content": "Elon Musk announced that he is pushing Tesla to increase its electric vehicle production due to what he anticipates will soon be increased demand for autonomous driving. Tesla’s production plans have undergone significant changes over the last five years. The automaker started the decade growing at a roughly 50% annual rate and aimed to produce 20 million cars annually by 2030. Now, Tesla has a production capacity of less than 3 million vehicles, and it is using roughly only 60% of this capacity due to low demand. This situation has led Tesla to reconsider its plans for new factories, including its previously announced gigafactory in Mexico. Today, Tesla released its Q3 financial results, and CEO Elon Musk took the opportunity to announce that the automaker will now increase production: I feel confident in expanding Tesla’s production. So that is our intent, to expand as quickly as we can our future production. I was reticent to do that until we had clarity on achieving unsupervised full self-driving, but at this point, I feel like we’ve got clarity and it makes sense to expand production as fast as we reasonably can. The CEO stated that he is “100% confident” that Tesla will solve unsupervised self-driving – a claim he has made every year for the last six years. Musk said that once people can text inside their cars, demand won’t be an issue: Here’s the killer app: really, what it comes down to is, “Can you text while you’re in the car?” And if you tell someone, “Yes, the car is now so good you can be on your phone and text the entire time while you’re in the car,” anyone who can buy the car will buy the car. End of story. He added that the most significant increase in production will come from Cybercab, which he expects will enter production in Q2 2026. The vehicle lacks a steering wheel and pedals. Therefore, if Tesla doesn’t solve unsupervised self-driving by then, it will be useless. The CEO reiterated that he expects Tesla to remove the safety monitor from its Robotaxi in Austin, Texas, by the end of the year and release unsupervised FSD in consumer vehicles on the same timeline. Increasing production based on presumed demand coming from a feature, unsupervised self-driving, that isn’t finished, and that you have been consistently wrong in predicting. Elon always says that “people don’t understand how impactful self-driving will be.” I think they do. He is confusing people not believing his self-driving timelines with people not believing in self-driving. If Tesla does deliver unsupervised self-driving in HW4 vehicles, I do believe that it will result in a significant increase in demand. My prediction: Tesla launches Cybercab with a steering wheel and normal Tesla driving controls, with a promise that it will be fully self driving \"in about a year\". It will be the cheaper car (but not remotely near $25k cheap), and most importantly, every sale will count towards his compensation package. However, I don’t think Tesla is as close as Elon is leading shareholders to believe. Tesla may or may not remove the safety drivers from its Robotaxis in Austin, but that’s a geo-fenced areas with a bunch of limitations. Turning on unsupervised self-driving in consumer vehicles and Tesla taking responsibility for the system is an entirely different thing, and the automaker is not ready for it. But there’s some good that could come out of this. If Tesla increases Model 3 and Model Y production in anticipation of full self-driving, it could result in lower prices.

    "content": "As more riders switch to using two wheels for many of their journeys around town, it’s important to remember that the convenience of an e-bike doesn’t mean it’s totally maintenance-free. Even if you’ve chosen a model designed to minimize maintenance, there are still a few things that can creep up on you. Here are three areas I recommend taking a look at before winter hits. The other day, I finally got around to doing a once-over on my wife’s e-bike to perform all three of these checks – and it’s a good thing I did. She’s a year-round rider who commutes to work each day on her bike, which I love, but it also means her ride takes a beating over time. I’m the one who handles the e-bike maintenance in our home (hey, we all have our specialties), and so I try to do periodic checks on her bikes since I don’t get a sense of them like I do my own bikes several times a week. So there I was, with her bike flipped upside down in the middle of the living room like a good apartment-dwelling cyclist. What started as a quick once-over turned into a reminder that there are three critical maintenance checks every e-bike rider should do before winter (or really, any time). I figured I’d turn my own experience into a friendly PSA, because if your bike looks anything like hers did, it’s time for some TLC. The three areas that can often get away from riders are their tires, their brakes, and their spokes (especially on a hub motor e-bike). Here’s why they’re so important, why they’re so easy to forget, and what to do about them. My wife started riding to work daily just over two years ago, and she’s been on the same set of tires since then. Her stock tires were already a street tread that bordered on slicks, but when I went to do her few-month checkup, I realized her rear tire was basically bald and the front wasn’t far off. That’s not great under our normal conditions, but it’s downright dangerous heading into winter, when wet roads, fallen leaves, and potentially snowy or icy patches are just waiting to steal your traction. She wanted to stick with whitewall tires, and unfortunately, there aren’t many great options for whitewall tires in a 20″ size, so she ended up with slightly narrower tires. But I did swap on some new street options, and now she’s set for the winter. Tires can get away from new riders since they aren’t a touch point, and riders aren’t often looking at their tires each day the same way they are other parts of the bike that are closer to eye level. But new tires give you better grip, better stopping power, and a lot more peace of mind. If your tires are looking cracked, slick, or just plain tired – replace them. For winter, I like to recommend tires with a more aggressive tread pattern, or even studded tires if you’re riding in snow and ice. It’s a cheap investment for a major safety upgrade. Broken spokes can become a common problem on hub motor e-bikes after a few years, especially lower-cost models that prioritize budget pricing. That’s the trade-off: you get better pricing up front, but you pay for it on the backend with components just not lasting as long. While I had the wheels off of my wife’s bike for the tire swap, I gave the spokes a quick check – and found three broken ones in her rear wheel. That might not sound like a big deal, but broken spokes, especially in hub motor wheels, can throw the whole thing out of balance. Over time, it can lead to wheel wobble, motor strain, or worse – a dangerous crash. And to make matters worse, broken spokes are a runaway condition. As soon as one goes, there’s more load on the others near it, meaning if they are already weakened, they’ll start popping too. That leaves even fewer spokes supporting the load, and suddenly you start hearing wind chime sounds from your rear wheel, followed by an awfully rough ride. So if you ever notice one broken spoke, it’s time to replace it right away. I measured her spokes, found a 10-pack of replacements that were only a few millimeters off, and replaced the broken spokes (if you can land within 2-3mm of the right length, you’re probably fine). This job is a bit trickier and will require truing the wheel afterwards, so it’s best to let a bike shop handle this task if you aren’t up for learning to true your own wheel. But with a half hour of work and only minimal swearing, I had her wheel as good as new. A lot of new riders just assume spokes last forever, and while good ones nearly do, budget bikes with wheels that just weren’t that well built to begin with (or used cheap spokes) can start showing their age in a few years. It’s a good reminder that just because the wheel spins doesn’t mean it’s healthy. Grab each spoke and give it a gentle squeeze – if any are loose or broken, don’t wait to fix them. Brakes are the third thing that is an “out of sight, out of mind” situation for a lot of riders. Your brakes might feel fine with the proper cable length or well-bled hydraulic lines, but your pads could be so worn down that you’ll soon run out of braking power. While I already had her wheels off to change tires, I popped my wife’s brake pads out to inspect them. This is the one area she actually passed. Her pads showed wear but still had some good life left in them. For folks who don’t ride too fast, or don’t bomb down hills, or are just petite riders, brake pads can last a long time. But if you carry cargo, ride faster, or are a heavier rider, your brake pads can wear down to the bare metal quicker than you might think. Brake pad wear can sneak up on you, especially if your e-bike has more weight and speed than a typical pedal bike. Pull the pads and check the thickness – if they’re worn down to 1mm or less, it’s getting close to time for new ones. It’s a five-minute job that can literally save your life. And while you’re at it, clean your rotors and make sure the braking surface is oil-free and smooth. This wasn’t a major repair day. All three of these checks, plus the two repairs, took a bit over an hour or so. It was more or less a quick maintenance session that reminded me how easily small issues can snowball if you’re not paying attention. While I know to watch for these things on my bikes, my wife is a newer rider who, like countless others, might not be thinking about the details when the bike is just a tool to get to work. So let this be a reminder that whether you ride daily or just occasionally, now’s the time to give your e-bike a pre-winter tune-up. Tires, spokes, brakes – they’re the hidden things many riders forget about day-to-day, but they can be the difference between a safe, smooth ride and a mid-commute disaster. What other components would you recommend occasionally doing a bit of a deeper inspection on? Let me know in the comment section below! FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

    "content": "Tesla announced that it started to produce its own new solar panel at Gigafactory New York in Buffalo. The first deliveries are expected in Q1 2026. After years of neglecting its solar business, Tesla has been reviving it over the last few months. At least temporarily. Last year, Tesla’s solar deployment got so low that it even stopped reporting it. However, earlier this month, Tesla relaunched its solar leasing product. The company didn’t hide the fact that this was an opportunistic move. During Tesla’s Q3 conference call yesterday, Mike Snyder, Tesla’s VP of energy and charging, noted a surge in residential solar demand due to “policy changes”: “We’ve also seen a surge in residential solar demand in the US due to policy changes, which we expect to continue into the first half of 2026, as we introduced a new solar lease product.” He is referencing the Trump administration killing the 30% tax credit for residential solar at the end of the year. Interestingly, Snyder also announced that Tesla is building a new solar panel in the US: We also began production of our Tesla residential solar panel in our Buffalo factory, and we will be shipping that to customers starting Q1. The panel has industry-leading aesthetics and shade performance, and demonstrates our continued commitment to US manufacturing. Tesla has previously claimed to have its own solar panels, but Panasonic briefly manufactured them at Tesla’s Gigafactory New York in Buffalo. Later, they rebranded solar panels made by South Korea’s Hanwha. Tesla recently upgraded the specs of its solar panels on its website from 405 to 410 watts: However, the specs match almost exactly the Hanwha Qcells Q.PEAK DUO ML-G10+ (410W). It’s unclear if these are the specs of the panel Snyder referred to or a different current offering. Tesla bringing back solar panel production to its Buffalo factory in 2025 would mark an interesting full-circle milestone for the storied plant, which has gone through many phases. The project was initially supposed to produce solar panels, but it transitioned to solar roof tiles under Tesla, which failed to become a major product and resulted in the factory being underutilized. August 2024: Tesla signs a new lease agreement, extending its commitment to the factory until 2034. The deal is contingent on the $500M Dojo investment; failure to invest would reportedly double Tesla’s rent. It has since transitioned to mainly producing Supercharger components and housing Tesla’s data labeling team. Here’s a quick bulletpoint history of Tesla’s Gigafactory New York: If you are in the US, the next few weeks are likely the last opportunity to secure a solar installation and take advantage of the federal tax credit, which is set to expire.

    "content": "Elon Musk needs Tesla investors to vote for his $1 trillion payday so that he can control a robot army. Yes, really, that’s what he said. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is no stranger to unrealistic proclamations, but today’s is a doozie. In the midst of an upcoming shareholder vote to give Musk a $1 trillion payday despite his recent poor performance as a CEO (with operating income down 40% during what should have been a record quarter), Tesla has been undergoing a media blitz trying to get shareholders to vote in favor of a plan to dilute their value and voting rights and saddle the company with the same CEO for the next decade. For his part, Musk has stated repeatedly that he wants this award not for money, but for more control over the company, because he “doesn’t feel comfortable” building AI unless he has more control over it (in keeping with this mentality, Musk started his own private AI company, xAI, to compete with Tesla, which is likely illegal). Nevermind that there are better options available which would increase his voting control without diluting all other shareholders, and nevermind that the reason he has less control of Tesla than he used to is because he sold TSLA shares to overpay billions of dollars for a social media platform he’s hopelessly addicted to, and then turned into a white supremacist haven. But this has at least been Musk’s story: he wants more control over AI development, and he needs more shares to do that. He thinks that his current ownership percentage of ~13% isn’t enough, and that ~25% is more comfortable. He hasn’t, however, mentioned the reason he wants that control. Today he did, and it’s because he wants to control a “robot army.” On Tesla’s Q3 conference call, Musk went on a tangent with his real thoughts on Optimus, Tesla’s (oft-remote-controlled) humanoid robot, in response to a shareholder question about the challenges of bringing Optimus to market. Here’s the way he ended that answer: My fundamental concern with regard to how much money and control I have at Tesla is if I go ahead and build this enormous robot army, can I just be ousted at some point in the future? Um, that’s my biggest concern, that is really the only thing Im trying to address with this… what’s called compensation but it’s not like I’m gonna go spend the money, it’s just if we build this robot army do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army? Not control but a strong influence. -Elon Musk, Tesla Q3 shareholder conference call, October 22, 2025 It’s apparent that he was trying to step back his comments mid-thought there, changing out the word “control” for “strong influence,” and the phrase “I go ahead and build” to “we build.” (I would suggest that perhaps the initial wordings used are more indicative of his true feelings on the matter than the ones he later changed to as his PR brain kicked in through the ketamine fog.) This is significantly different than past statements on this issue. Musk has often publicly stated his concern with AI, calling it a “risk” and “threat” to humanity, and said that he wants to be involved in its development to ensure safety. However, this statement had no mention of that. The discussion wasn’t about the safety of AI, but rather about wanting to control a robot army. And much of the statement was in the first person: he, alone, wants to “control” that robot army that he “builds.” Notably, also, it is very important that any controller of any army be able to be ousted. This is fundamental to the entire concept of modern governance and democracy, and when it doesn’t happen like that, countries tend to have problems. And, generally, the threshold for whether to remove someone from control of an army is not that you allow them to have 25% of the vote – usually, they get the same vote as everyone else (about 0.0000006%, in an American election these days). Let us put aside for the moment that, so far, Tesla’s Optimus robots have not yet shown the capabilities that would strike fear in the hearts of a fighting force. At one of Tesla’s big unveil events, it’s clear that the robots were teleoperated. Since then, we’ve seen robots fail to deliver popcorn. However, a recent video did show Optimus doing some pretty impressive kung-fu moves… but a later video of the robot doing the same routine at the opening of the new Tron movie suggests that much of the choreography was scripted. Regardless of that, and assuming the robots do improve rapidly enough to be a real threat to humanity, it is questionable that Musk’s fantasy involves him controlling a robot army that he in the past has said would number in the billions. The prospect of Elon Musk controlling a robot army might be of some concern considering Musk’s recent political advocacy, which has centered largely on advocating for racists wherever possible. This has included performing back-to-back unambiguous Nazi salutes in front of a large crowd, agreeing with a defense of Hitler’s actions in the Holocaust, and many other white supremacist statements. His advocacy hasn’t been limited just to the United States, he’s also meddled in other countries’ politics, including support for German neo-Nazis and rhetorical and monetary support in the UK for a violent racist fraudster who has been imprisoned multiple times. All of this has driven protests against the company, embarrassed owners and destroyed Tesla’s brand reputation, leading to falling sales in most territories. The behavior has limited Tesla’s business opportunities overseas, in the UK, Australia, Germany, Denmark, and so on. Musk also stated that he wants “more voting control, but not so much that I can’t be fired if I go insane,” claiming that that number is around 25% (but as the situation around this trillion-dollar award indicates, and the rest of Musk’s public behavior as listed above, that time has already passed). By the end of the call, Musk doubled-down on his “robot army”, stating further: I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here, and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis, who have no f**king clue. I mean those guys are corporate terrorists. Lemme explain the core problem here, so many of the passive funds vote along the lines of what ISS and Glass Lewis recommend. Now, they have made many terrible recommendations in the past that if those recommendations had been followed would have been extremely destructive to the future of the company. Now, If you’ve got passive funds that essentially defer responsibility for the vote to Glass Lewis and ISS, then you can have extremely disastrous consequences for a publicly traded company if too much of the publicly traded company is controlled by index funds. It’s de facto controlled by Glass Lewis and ISS. This is a fundamental problem for corporate governance, because they’re not voting along the lines that are actually good for shareholders. That’s the big issue, I mean, that’s what it comes down to. ISS Glass Lewis corporate terrorism. While Musk does not specify any of these supposed “terrible recommendations,” likely one of the ones he’s referring to was when ISS/Glass Lewis recommended a “no” vote on Musk’s illegal $55 billion pay package, which would pay a CEO who has overseen a significant drop in Tesla earnings more than double the total amount of money that Tesla has made in profits over its entire lifetime. And while Musk claims that having a disinterested entity interested in shareholder value is bad for shareholders, Musk apparently does not mind if he is that entity, and if his interests are opposed to shareholder interests, as in the case of the situation surrounding the current shareholder vote. In contrast to Musk’s statement, the actual analyses of ISS and Glass Lewis are highly analytical, lay out their case dispassionately, argue in favor of maintaining shareholder rights, and even take some positions in agreement with Tesla’s board where they think those would be beneficial for shareholders, showing their lack of “partisanship,” so to speak, on the matter. ISS and Glass Lewis’ arguments are certainly more detailed, more accurate to reality, less reeking of political language, and delivered with more lucidity than whatever the heck that robot army rant from Musk was all about. Robot armies are absolutely not the theme of many dystopian sci-fi movies. Not at all. We’ve stated before that Elon Musk’s $1 trillion stock award gets more ridiculous the more you look into it, but we didn’t quite expect something as ridiculous as today’s proclamation. But hey, if this dude from that weird rant above seems like the kind of “leader” you want to control a robot army, by all means, give up your voting rights for him.

    "content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk managed to find a way to turn lobbying, which is typically one of the most efficient ways to spend money as a company, into a net revenue loser for his company – flipping the script again from a true “innovator” in the field of corporate destruction. Tesla released its 10-Q filing today, to supplement its Q3 shareholder letter and conference call from yesterday’s quarterly report. The filing gives us more detail about what’s going on with Tesla’s financials, namely, how Tesla managed to have record revenue last quarter and yet still have a 40% drop in operating income from the year-ago quarter. One explanation for this drop is lost revenue from regulatory credits. Regulatory credits have been a relatively stable portion of Tesla’s earnings over the years, as it is one of few companies producing more electric vehicles than it is legally required to. Several governments have committed to reducing pollution, and one way that they can do so is by requiring automakers to make less-polluting vehicles. Generally, if an automaker fails to meet the guidelines set up by government, they have to pay a penalty for polluting the air too much and harming everyone with that pollution. Or, instead of paying that penalty, they can buy credits from a company that exceeded the guidelines, thus transferring money from the companies that are doing a bad job to the companies that are doing a good job. Every government has a slightly different way of implementing requirements and credit swaps, but this is generally how it works on a high level. Put aside for the moment that these penalties, or the cost of credit swaps, are almost always far lower than the actual amount of damage done by pollution, this is at least one method that governments can and have used to try to encourage cleaner air and lower health costs for the populations they govern. That is, until the republican party came along. Buried in the $4 trillion giveaway to wealthy elites passed by republicans earlier this year was another provision to reduce the cost of regulatory fines in the US to $0. Congress could not legally eliminate the fines, since they are mandated by the Clean Air Act, and republicans in Congress didn’t want to modify the Clean Air Act because it would be more obvious to everyone that they want dirty air, and because they didn’t have the votes to do so. But they did have the votes to do an end-run around democracy and eliminate the fines, which makes the regulation effectively useless. So now, automakers have less incentive to work on making their cars more efficient. This means you’ll be buying more gasoline, that gas prices will go up (and the increased price won’t go to any social good, but rather to line oil companies’ pockets), and that you’ll suffer from more air pollution which leads to higher health costs for everyone. When, in contrast, President Biden had strengthened this rule, just the modifications made by his administration were estimated to save $600-700 over the lifetime of each vehicle, or $23 billion in total across the US. But that’s only from Biden’s improvement of this specific rule; the rule in total saves much more, in comparison to not having the rule at all. But what does this all have to Elon Musk? During the 2024 US election, Elon Musk spent a total of $288 million on bribes to get anti-EV candidates elected. He did this despite full public knowledge that these candidates opposed electric vehicles, and had promised to harm them. But, due to Musk’s social media addiction to his bizarre upside-down twitter feed, he and many others convinced themselves that somehow, harming EVs would be good for an EV company. So, Musk spent the millions, got what he wanted, claims it was all because of him (egotistical much?), and as a result, his company… is worse off. According to the company’s 10-Q filing, Tesla lost $1.41 billion worth of revenue in just the last 9 months that it would have had if not for changes in regulatory regimes. Here’s the passage, in financial speak: As of September 30, 2025, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $3.27 billion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $877 million in the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period. Changes in regulations on automotive regulatory credits may significantly impact our remaining performance obligations and revenue to be recognized under these contracts. In 2025, governmental and regulatory actions have repealed and/or restricted certain regulatory credit programs tied to our products, contributing to the $1.41 billion decrease in our remaining performance obligations as of September 30, 2025 compared to December 31, 2024. Translated, that means that the value of Tesla’s various contracts to sell regulatory credits to other companies has reduced by $1.41 billion dollars as compared to where they were at the end of last year. Tesla says that the specific reason for this is due to the change in regulatory credits that its bad CEO lobbied for. Tesla also suffered reduced profitability over the course of the quarter due to increased tariff costs, but does not quantify the amount lost to this. So the losses are certainly more than $1.4 billion. Some could argue that the value of Musk’s lobbying was to get a foot in the door, and to be able to influence republicans to do less anti-EV stuff than they might have otherwise done, but that hasn’t turned out to be the case. There is no indication that republicans have softened their anti-EV position, and in fact, they keep doubling down on trying to harm you and ignoring science. And besides, Musk hasn’t even maintained any relationships, after a very public breakup. So, somehow, Musk managed to turn lobbying spend from one of the most efficient possible ways a corporation can spend money, into one of the most inefficient ways. Normally, lobbying is considered an incredibly efficient way for companies to make money. Various analyses have suggested that the average return on investment from lobbying dollars is anywhere between 22,000% and 104,000%. (Yes, this is a problem, but it’s not what we’re discussing at the moment). However, in this case, lobbying produced a loss of 489% of the money spent – and that’s just counting the losses caused in the last 9 months, and only in regulatory credits. Those credits would have been pure profit, too, with no cost of revenue associated with them, so this is just a straight loss of money for the company and its shareholders. In addition to those losses, there’s the lost revenue from vehicle sales. While this has not yet been recognized by the company, going forward Tesla sales will experience a dip now that all of Tesla’s automotive and home energy products – essentially, all of the products that Tesla sells – have been made more expensive in the US due to political changes. Either Tesla can choose to lower prices to maintain post-credit pricing and take a hit to margins of $7,500 per vehicle and 30% on home energy products, or it can hold prices the same and lose customers due to lower affordability of its products… or it can release subpar, long-promised products that cost more and are worse than the thing they’re replacing. Needless to say, none of these options are great for business. And so, since vehicle credits didn’t end until the end of Q3 (causing a pull-forward in demand, which is the main reason for record deliveries), and since home energy credits go away at the end of this coming quarter (and if you want your last chance to get in before they do, get started here), that means business going forward from this quarter will be even worse than the last few dismal quarters have been. In addition to lost revenue from credits, there is another issue which is more difficult to track, but is definitely happening. That is the issue of brand damage that Musk’s political activities have had on the company. Tesla is the only EV brand with negative perception, and it’s directly correlated to Musk’s political activities. His actions haven’t just harmed Tesla domestically, but abroad, where the company has lost business opportunities in in the UK, Australia, Germany, Denmark, and has seen falling sales in most territories, along with protests and embarrassed owners. Tesla has already lost a lot of sales and will lose more, which means less revenue, and less profit. That $1.41 billion is just a start. Despite this horrendously inefficient use of funds by a CEO who has shown time and time again that he is outright hostile to the company he spends a small portion of his time running, Musk has also directed the company to spend more funds on an advertising effort to give him up to $1 trillion worth of Tesla stock. The trillion-dollar number takes into account some optimistic stock growth for the company (which is unlikely given Musk’s recent performance as CEO, where earnings have dropped precipitously), but is still around 40x more than Tesla has ever made over its entire history. It would be the largest CEO payday in history by multiple orders of magnitude. 1.4 billion lost just in regulatory credits, and the cost in terms of cratering sales is way more than that. Regardless of whether stock appreciates enough to give Musk all the shares covered under the plan, there is still room in the proposals for him to be granted well over 200 million newly printed shares of stock (worth around $90 billion) for doing nothing whatsoever, leading to dilution of voting rights and share value for current shareholders. The plan gives Musk’s personal friends on Tesla’s board significant discretion in this matter, and saddles the company with his poor leadership for another decade. It would also give him a huge source of wealth, which he could turn into cash, to spend on other lobbying activities to harm Tesla’s business, as he has proven above that he is happy to do. If Musk can manage to lose Tesla $1.41+ billion with $288 million, imagine what he could do with $1 trillion. The 30% federal solar tax credit is ending this year.

    "content": "A new campaign is adding to the growing chorus of pushback against Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s absurdly large proposed $1 trillion pay package, this time led by unions and public interest groups. The campaign encourages individuals to get in contact with their pension or retirement funds and ask them to vote against Musk’s payday. In September, Tesla’s board proposed a stock award worth up to $1 trillion for CEO Elon Musk. It includes several milestones regarding Tesla stock and product performance, each of which unlocks tens of billions of dollars for Musk. It’s the largest award proposed for any CEO of any company by multiple orders of magnitude – with previous proposed Musk awards holding the second and third place positions as well. In addition to that much-reported proposal, another proposal is up for a vote which would create a special share reserve of 208 million shares (current value $92 billion) which the Tesla board can give to Elon Musk with no strings attached. Both proposals will be voted on by TSLA shareholders at Tesla’s shareholder meeting on November 6. Many groups have chimed in to raise the alarm about these proposals and how they’re bad for Tesla shareholders. Most recently, the two largest advisory groups, ISS and Glass Lewis, recommended that shareholders vote against. Earlier, a group of public pension funds including the comptrollers of several US states, the American Federation of Teachers, and a Swedish insurance group. Tesla has lashed out with attacks on each of these groups after their dispassionate analysis of the proposals’ flaws. We at Electrek also did a deep dive into the proposals, with background and details on the proposals and how they’re bad for employees and shareholders, which you can read here: Elon Musk’s $1 trillion stock award gets more ridiculous the more you look into it Now a new group has joined the chorus, calling itself “Take Back Tesla.” It’s led by unions, encouraging individuals with pension or retirement funds to get in touch with the controllers of those funds and ask them to vote no on Musk’s pay package. Take Back Tesla consists of the American Federation of Teachers (who signed the previous pension fund letter) and the Communication Workers of America, who represent around 2.5 million workers combined. Several public interest groups have joined on, including Public Citizen, Stop the Money Pipeline, Americans for Financial Reform, Ekō, and People’s Action Institute. These groups are generally focused on reducing the power of corporations in politics, reducing wealth concentration, and opposing the corrupting and polluting power of the fossil fuel industry. The groups bring up some of the same points that have been brought up before, but are more focused on public advocacy and Musk’s recent political actions, in addition to protecting value for the common shareholder. Rather than talking about dilution (which the proposals will increase, removing rights and value from shareholders), Take Back Tesla focuses more on the inequity involved in the plan. It points out that the proposed pay package for Musk tops out at a Tesla market cap of $8.5 trillion, about 2x the current market cap of the most valuable company on Earth, NVIDIA. However, Musk would be paid 2,000x as much as NVIDIA’s CEO Jensen Huang, who made $50 million last year. It also asserts that a Tesla employee making the median Tesla salary would need to work 1.7 million years to match a single year of Musk’s yearly compensation under the plan (we checked the salary numbers, and it seems Take Back Tesla might be using a low estimate or not counting stock-based compensation – but that doesn’t change the point too much, especially since Tesla just drained its employee stock reserve to give it all to Elon Musk). The groups are also particularly interested in the effects that Musk himself has had on employees around the country. AFT president Randi Weingarten said: The Tesla board, instead of upholding basic governance standards, wants to green light an outrageous $1 trillion pay package for a CEO who has spent most of the year engaged in childish political brawls, rather than working to create shareholder value. To reward this destructive behavior with an obscene salary is a slap in the face—not only to the federal workers he’s fired, but to the retirees whose pensions are invested in Tesla stock. We urge shareholders to join with us and demand their state pension officials reject Musk’s money grab and confiscate the Tesla board’s rubber stamp. The reason Take Back Tesla is interested in pension funds is because, beyond individual Tesla shareholders, many people in the US are invested in TSLA via their 401(k) or IRA. Since TSLA is one of the largest companies on the market, almost every fund will hold some exposure to it. Which means that this issue isn’t just of interest to those who directly hold TSLA shares, but to almost everyone with any exposure to the stock market – all of whom would be better off with more stable leadership at the top of one of the largest companies in America. It could seem strange that groups looking to stop the fossil fuel industry would target Elon Musk, CEO of the largest American electric car company. But Musk has recently proven himself to be one of the fossil fuel industry’s greatest political allies. Musk gave $288M, more money than any individual, to a political effort which strives to harm EVs, and the group he donated that money to has put significant effort into increasing oil use, subsidizing gas cars and destroying the climate, not just in the US but abroad. This has caused great harm to the US EV industry, but Musk has continued to offer rhetorical and monetary support regardless. In addition, during his time cosplaying as an unofficial government advisor, Musk recommended the firing of hundreds of thousands of government employees, working to balloon the government deficit by making it less able to do its job. This is particularly of interest to the unions involved in this effort, who protect the interests of the very same public employees Musk targeted. Take Back Tesla urges institutional shareholders to “oppose excessive CEO compensation and demand that any proposed pay package for Musk be reasonable and rationally benchmarked to the compensation of CEOs at other similarly sized companies.” The groups also oppose “the election of any Tesla Board of Directors members who do not demonstrate appropriate independence from the CEO and adherence to corporate governance best practices.” For more information and to sign a petition which will be delivered to fund managers, visit takebacktesla.com.
